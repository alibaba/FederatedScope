Passage 1:On February 6, 2013, Granite sold KSEE's non-license assets to the Nexstar Broadcasting Group, with Nexstar also intending to purchase KSEE's license following Federal Communications Commission approval; in the interim, Nexstar operated the station via a time brokerage agreement. The deal made KSEE a sister station to CBS affiliate KGPE, which Nexstar had just acquired from Newport Television. Normally, duopolies between two \"Big Four\" affiliates, let alone \"Big Three,\" would not be allowed because those stations are usually the four highest-rated stations in a market, which FCC regulations do not allow any common ownership of. However, according to Nielsen, in 2013 KGPE was ranked as the fourth highest-rated station in the market and KSEE fifth, after KFSN (ABC), KFTV (Univision), and KMPH-TV (Fox), allowing a duopoly to be formed between the stations. This marked the second instance (after the Gannett Company purchased ABC affiliate WJXX in Jacksonville, Florida, creating a duopoly with that market's NBC affiliate WTLV, in 2000) in which a single company owns a duopoly involving two stations that are affiliated by a Big Three television network; and is also Nexstar's first true Big Three duopoly (Nexstar's other Big Three duopolies are virtually formed, in which the other station is owned by Mission Broadcasting). The merger was approved on April 17, and completed by May 31.\n Passage 2:There, Simon took a room at the boarding house Haddon Hall, in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, near Columbia University. At the suggestion of the art director of the New York Journal American, he sought and found freelance work at Paramount Pictures, working above the Paramount Theatre on Broadway, retouching the movie studio's publicity photos. He also found freelance work at Macfadden Publications, doing illustrations for True Story and other magazines. Sometime afterward, his boss, art director Harlan Crandall, recommended Simon to Lloyd Jacquet, head of Funnies, Inc., one of that era's comic-book \"packagers\" that supplied comics content on demand to publishers testing the new medium. That day, Simon received his first comics assignment, a seven-page Western.\n Passage 3:The Anzac class originated from RAN plans to replace the six River-class destroyer escorts with a mid-capability patrol frigate. The Australian shipbuilding industry was thought to be incapable of warship design, so the RAN decided to take a proven foreign design and modify it. Around the same time, the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) was looking to replace four Leander-class frigates; a deterioration in New Zealand-United States relations, the need to improve alliances with nearby nations, and the commonalities between the RAN and RNZN ships' requirements led the two nations to begin collaborating on the acquisition in 1987. Tenders were requested by the Anzac Ship Project at the end of 1986, with 12 ship designs (including an airship) submitted. By August 1987, the tenders were narrowed down in October to Blohm + Voss's MEKO 200 design, the M class (later Karel Doorman class) offered by Royal Schelde, and a scaled-down Type 23 frigate proposed by Yarrow Shipbuilders. In 1989, the Australian government announced that Melbourne-based shipbuilder AMECON (which became Tenix Defense) would build the modified MEKO 200 design. The Australians ordered eight ships, while New Zealand ordered two, with an unexercised option for two more.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

They reached their fifth and so far last FA Cup Final. After a win over Hull City in Round 3, they scraped past Notts County and Liverpool, they beat York City in the quarter-final in a replay, before beating the favourites Sunderland at Ewood Park in the semi-final, meaning they would play Preston North End in the final, a repeat of the 1922 FA Cup Final, the only one of Town's previous final appearances that they won. The final at Wembley was the first since moving to the London stadium to go into extra time. The result would be the opposite to the 1922 final, with Town conceding a penalty to lose the match 1\u20130.\n Passage 2:In 1994, he was introduced to Erick Sermon of EPMD by his friend K-Solo. Sermon included Murray on his album No Pressure on the single \"Hostile\", with critics praising Murray's lyrical ability. His appearance on Hostile led to Murray being signed to Jive Records, and work began on his first album. Murray's debut single, The Most Beautifullest Thing in This World was released in 1994 and was a hit. The song was produced by Erick Sermon (who also provided background vocals) and peaked at number 50 on the Billboard 200 and number 3 on the Hot Rap Singles chart. Murray's debut album The Most Beautifullest Thing in This World, was named after the single and released in 1994 to widespread critical acclaim and commercial success, being certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in August 1995.

He made his debut for City on 5 September 1903, playing at left back away to Stoke City on the opening day of the 1903\u201304 season. In 1906, in the wake of a scandal regarding players' wages, Manchester City were forced into selling most of their players, and Burgess was purchased by Manchester United along with Sandy Turnbull, Jimmy Bannister and Billy Meredith.

Both his father, also named Norman, and his grandfather, Gilbert, were keen golfers. The former was the All India Amateur Golf Champion in 1893 and 1894, while the latter captained Prestwick Golf Club. He moved to England with his family at the age of five to live in Minehead, Somerset, and gained a scholarship to Sedbergh School based in Cumbria. At Sedbergh he developed quickly as a cricketer, first playing for the school's first team aged 15. The subsequent year, he scored 302 not out in a house match in one afternoon. In the summer of 1931, after scoring two half-centuries for Sedbergh against Durham School and Stonyhurst College, Mitchell-Innes was called up to play for Somerset County Cricket Club in a County Championship match against Warwickshire. He had to travel down from Scotland by overnight train for the fixture at the County Ground, Taunton.

Passage 1: November 1915, von Brincken married again to the San Francisco socialite Milo Abercrombie (1895-1977). Born in Houston, Texas, Milo was the niece of John W. Abercrombie, U.S. congressman from Alabama and acclaimed by noted portraitist Harrison Fisher as \"California's greatest beauty\". They had two children, Wilhelm Friedrich (1918-1980) and Maria A. (1917-2010). She divorced von Brincken in 1919 during his imprisonment and legally changed her and their two children's last name back to her maiden name, Abercrombie, so her children would not be \"ashamed\" of their name. Despite the divorce, von Brincken remained devoted to his former wife and she was able to remarry again, thanks to him. When the Roman Catholic Church forbade Abercrombie's intended marriage to U.S. Navy lieutenant Lyman K. Swenson, due to her divorce, von Brincken came forth and disclosed his earlier marriage to Alice Roedel. As both Roedel and von Brincken were Catholic, that marriage was sanctioned by the Church. Thus, the Church did not recognize von Brincken's later marriage to Abercrombie. Abercrombie and Swenson, who had both refused to marry unless it was sanctioned by the Catholic Church were then free to wed. Abercrombie and Swenson were married on August 11, 1920 by Father John Byrne at St Mary's Cathedral in San Francisco. At the wedding dinner that night, von Brincken's young son with Abercrombie, referred to as \"John\" and \"Buster\" in the press, was a \"guest of honor\" and toasted by his new stepfather and the officers of the submarine H-6 that he commanded, pledging, \"the little chap's future to the uniform of blue.\" Swenson and Abercrombie had two children, Lyman K. Jr. (\"Robert\") and Cecilia. Abercrombie obtained an interlocutory decree of divorce from Swenson in May 1925, with the final decree a year later. Several months later, in October 1925, the newspapers speculated that Abercrombie would marry another naval officer, Lieutenant Commander Hugo W. Koehler, reputed to be the \"wealthiest officer\" in the Navy. The third generation of a wealthy St. Louis brewery family, Koehler had been a naval intelligence and U.S. State Department spy in South Russia during the Russian Revolution. Swenson had introduced Milo Abercrombie to Koehler in Honolulu. Koehler was in Panama with his ship, USS West Virginia (BB-48) when he read a newspaper account that he was engaged to marry Milo Abercrombie. Brushing it off, Koehler curtly told the press, \"Some error,\" while Abercrombie did not take it so lightly. \"I have been deeply humiliated\", she told reporters, her eyes \"wet with tears\". \"This is a most unkind blow of fate. I cannot possibly understand how this false rumor got about.\" Two years later, Koehler married Matilda Pell, the ex-wife of U.S. Congressman Herbert Pell (D-NY) and mother of future United States Senator Claiborne Pell (D-RI). In a bitter child visitation court battle in 1927 that went all the way to the California Court of Appeals, Abercrombie lost custody of her children with Swenson to him, after making baseless accusations that he had molested their four-year old daughter, Cecelia. The appellate court excoriated Abercrombie, \"[I]in furtherance of a manifest determination to prevent him from ever seeing the children again, under any circumstances, she was instrumental in inspiring and promoting a scheme directly involving one of the children which had for its obvious purpose the ruination of respondent's character as a man, the bringing about of his complete disgrace as a naval officer, and the destruction of the love and affection which his children had theretofore manifested toward him.\" Swenson v. Swenson\" (1929) 101 Cal.App. 440. In 1929, Lyman Swenson married Loretta B. Bruner (1897-1979). His son, Lyman K. Swenson Jr. (\"Robert\") (1923-2016) was also a US Naval officer.\n Passage 2:Halleck's plan, finalized in January 1864, called for Banks to take 20,000 troops up from New Orleans to Alexandria, including the 47th Pennsylvania Infantry, the only regiment from the Keystone State to fight in this campaign, on a route up the Bayou Teche (in Louisiana, the term bayou is used to refer to a slow moving river or stream), where they would be met by 15,000 troops sent down from Major General William T. Sherman's forces in Vicksburg, Mississippi, and under the command of Brigadier General A.J. Smith. Smith's forces were available to Banks only until the end of April, when they would be sent back east where they were needed for other Union military actions. Banks would command this combined force of 35,000, which would be supported in its march up the Red River towards Shreveport by Union Navy Rear Admiral David Dixon Porter's fleet of gunboats. At the same time, 7,000 Union troops from the Department of Arkansas under the command of Major General Frederick Steele would be sent south from Arkansas to rendezvous with Banks in his attack on Shreveport, and to serve as the garrison for that city after its capture.\n Passage 3:Zorin was born in Novocherkassk. After joining the Soviet Communist Party in 1922, Zorin held a managerial position in a Moscow City Committee and the Central Committee of the Komsomol until 1932. In 1935, he graduated from the Communist Institute of Education (\u0412\u044b\u0441\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0443\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0432\u0435\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f). In 1935-1941, Zorin worked on numerous Party assignments and as a teacher. In 1941-1944, he was employed at the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs. In 1945-1947, Zorin was the Soviet ambassador to Czechoslovakia. In 1948, he helped organize the Czechoslovak coup d'\u00e9tat. In 1947-1955 and again in 1956-1965, he was Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union. At the same time, he held other positions, including that of the permanent Soviet representative at the UN Security Council in 1952-1953. In 1955-1956, Zorin was the first Soviet ambassador to the Federal Republic of Germany. In 1956-1965, he again represented the Soviet Union at the UN Security Council, which led to his famous confrontation with Adlai Stevenson on 25 October 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:At the same time, other explanations were proposed that did not concord with general relativity. Edward Milne proposed an explanation compatible with special relativity but not general relativity that there was a giant explosion that could explain redshifts (see Milne universe). Others proposed that systematic effects could explain the redshift-distance correlation. Along this line, Fritz Zwicky proposed a \"tired light\" mechanism in 1929. Zwicky suggested that photons might slowly lose energy as they travel vast distances through a static universe by interaction with matter or other photons, or by some novel physical mechanism. Since a decrease in energy corresponds to an increase in light's wavelength, this effect would produce a redshift in spectral lines that increase proportionally with the distance of the source. The term \"tired light\" was coined by Richard Tolman in the early 1930s as a way to refer to this idea.\n Passage 2:Wish You Were Here was Wills's second album. This was his most commercially successful, earning a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. The lead-off single \"I Do (Cherish You)\" and its followup, \"Don't Laugh at Me\", both reached No.\u00a02 on the country charts, with the former bringing him to the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time. Following the pair of No.\u00a02-peaking songs was the album's title track. Co-written by Bill Anderson, Skip Ewing, and Debbie Moore, it became Wills's first No.\u00a01 country hit in 1999. Later that year, the boy band 98 Degrees covered \"I Do (Cherish You)\" on their album 98 Degrees and Rising. Following \"Wish You Were Here\" was \"She's in Love\", the final single from Wish You Were Here, which peaked at No.\u00a07. In 1998, Wills received an Academy of Country Music award for Top New Male Vocalist.\n Passage 3:In 1843, Barnett was elected (by the Georgia State Senate) to the position of Georgia Secretary of State, a position he held for three terms until 1849. He was subsequently elected to another, single, term in 1851. He was again elected to the position for the period 1861-1868, but was removed by the Military Governor at the onset of the Reconstruction era. It is said that Barnett twice saved the Great Seal of the State of Georgia. The first time was when Union troops under William Tecumseh Sherman were about to capture the State Capitol at Milledgeville. Barnett took the seal, and numerous official documents and Acts, and with the assistance of his wife Mary, buried them at his farm. After Sherman's troops marched on, Barnett returned the seal and the documents to the state. In 1866 Barnett again removed the Great Seal from the capitol. General Ruger, who was at that time acting as the Military Governor of Georgia, requested that Barnett affix the seal to an executive act, which Colonel Barnett could not approve. He refused to sanction the papers with the imprint of the seal and as a consequence was removed by General Ruger. Colonel Barnett then took the seal with him to prevent it from falling into the hands of what was considered an illegitimate Carpetbagger government which occupied the state: so that it was never affixed to any of the documents of misrule which followed under the carpetbag government. Since the seal was required, to certify official acts of the state government, the Reconstruction government fabricated a replacement. That replacement was identical in all respects except one. The soldier depicted on the replacement seal held his sword in the wrong hand. The period of the Reconstruction government in Georgia is thus referred to as the \"Period of the False Seal\". The Great Seal and documents were buried on Barnett's farm, and remained hidden there until 1868, when a new state constitution was enacted and a new government installed. After democrats regained control of state government, Barnett was again elected Secretary of State in 1873. Upon his return to office, both houses of the Legislature voted to present him with a replica of the Executive Seal, which replica is now in Savannah, Georgia, the property of the Georgia Historical Society. Barnett continued to serve as Secretary of State until his death on 2 February 1890. Toward the end of his more than 30 years of service as secretary of state under numerous administrations and into his late 80s, he was said to wear a row of three pairs of glasses. A portrait of Barnett hangs in the office of the Georgia Secretary of State to this day.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Dio's music career began there in 1957 as part of the Vegas Kings (later Ronnie and the Rumblers). In 1967, he formed the rock band Elf, which became a regular opening act for Deep Purple. In 1975, Deep Purple guitarist Ritchie Blackmore founded the band Rainbow and hired Dio to be his lead singer where the band released three studio albums. Dio quickly emerged as one of heavy rock's pre-eminent vocalists. In 1979, Dio joined Black Sabbath as lead singer. He appeared on three studio albums with the band which met with success: Heaven & Hell (1980) and Mob Rules (1981) and Dehumanizer (1992).

According to Roy Thomas, all of the Guardians of the Galaxy were created in a conference between Arnold Drake and Stan Lee, but it remains uncertain whether each individual character was created by Drake, Lee, or both. The Guardians of the Galaxy debuted in the partial reprint title Marvel Super-Heroes with issue #18 (Jan. 1969), written by Drake and penciled by Gene Colan. After five years' absence, he was revived in several Marvel titles: Marvel Two-In-One #4-5 (July-Sept. 1974), Giant Size Defenders #5, and Defenders #26-29 (July-Nov. 1975). In each case, other heroes such as Captain America, the Thing, and the Defenders aid Astro and the Guardians against the alien Badoon. The first story established that if Vance Astro's containment suit were breached, he would age 1,000 years in a second. This drew numerous queries from readers, and the letters page in Marvel Two-in-One #7 responded by stating that Vance feeds and defecates intravenously. The Guardians were also featured in Marvel Presents #3-12 (Feb. 1976 - Aug. 1977).\n Passage 3:Samuel Shaw was a Revolutionary War naval officer who, along with Richard Marven, were the first whistleblowers of the infant United States. As a whistleblower, Shaw was instrumental in the Continental Congress' passage of the first whistleblower protection law in the United States. Shaw, a midshipman, and Marven, a third lieutenant in the Continental Navy, were moved to act after witnessing the torture of British prisoners of war by Commodore Esek Hopkins, then Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Navy. Shaw and Marven were both from Rhode Island, as was Hopkins, whose brother was Stephen Hopkins, Governor of the new state, and a signatory to the Declaration of Independence. For reporting the misconduct of the Navy's highest officer, Shaw and Marven were both dismissed from the Navy. Worse still, Hopkins then filed a criminal libel suit against Shaw and Marven in the Rhode Island Courts.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

They are a member of the South Division of the National Football Conference (NFC) in the National Football League (NFL). The NFL awarded the city of New Orleans the 16th franchise in the league in November 1, 1966, All Saints Day, five months after the 89th United States Congress approved the merger of the NFL with the American Football League (AFL) in June of that year. In January 1967, the team was given the current \"New Orleans Saints\" name, and began playing in their first season in September of that year. Since the franchise's creation, it has been based in New Orleans. The team's home games were originally played at Tulane Stadium from 1967 to 1974, it was demolished in 1979, when the team relocated its home games to its current stadium, the Mercedes-Benz Superdome (formerly Louisiana Superdome from 1975 to 2011).\n Passage 3:The first five stages took place in and around Andalusia in southern Spain; the 2014 Vuelta had also started there. The first stage was a team time trial along the coast from Puerto Ban\u00fas to Marbella. The next four stages were fairly flat, although Stage 2 finished on a moderately difficult climb. The sixth stage started in C\u00f3rdoba and finished in Sierra de Cazorla in Ja\u00e9n on another moderately difficult climb. The seventh stage then returned to Andalusia for the first major difficulty of the race: the first-category summit finish at La Alpujarra. The route then continued along the eastern coast of Spain, with a medium-mountain seventh stage and another first-category summit finish at Benitachell on Stage 9. There was one more medium-mountain stage on Stage 10, taking the riders into the Province of Castell\u00f3n. This was followed by a transfer that took the riders into Andorra for a three-day spell, beginning with the first rest day. The eleventh stage took place entirely in Andorra; though it was only in length, it included six categorised climbs, including a summit finish, and was described by Eusebio Unzu\u00e9 (the manager of the Movistar team) as \"the toughest Vuelta stage that he has seen in more than 30 years\". Stage 12 took the riders back into Spain for a fairly flat stage, before three consecutive stages with summit finishes. These took place in the mountains of Cantabria and Asturias and were followed by the race's second rest day. The final week of the race included no summit finishes: the first stage was a individual time trial in Burgos and was then followed by three mixed stages that took the riders nearer to the final stage of the race, a sprint stage in Madrid. For the first time, the race organisers also held a women's race on the same day as the final stage, using the same circuit. This race \u2013 called La Madrid Challenge by La Vuelta \u2013 was won by Shelley Olds.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Members were abstentionist from the Third D\u00e1il established by the pro-Treaty faction. Just as the First D\u00e1il established a parallel Irish Republic in opposition to the British Dublin Castle administration, so Comhairle na dTeachta\u00ed attempted to establish a legitimatist government in opposition to the Provisional Government and Government of the Irish Free State established by the Third D\u00e1il. This legitimatist government, called the Council of State, had \u00c9amon de Valera as President. In 1926 de Valera resigned as President, left the Sinn F\u00e9in party and founded Fianna F\u00e1il, which in 1927 entered the Fourth D\u00e1il. Comhairle na dTeachta\u00ed, never more than a symbolic body, was thereby rendered defunct. In 1930 Cumann na nGaedheal TDs alleged in the D\u00e1il that de Valera had addressed Comhairle na dTeachta\u00ed in December 1926, after the foundation of Fianna F\u00e1il; this was to cast aspersions on de Valera's commitment to the Constitution of the Irish Free State.\n Passage 3:Spindler was born in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland, to an ethnic German family.

The Nagai continued to rule for about 150 years. The Nagai were supplanted in the Sengoku period by the Date clan, and the famed warlord Date Masamune was born at Yonezawa Castle. After Date Masamune defeated the Ashina clan in 1589, he moved his main castle to Kurokawa Castle in Aizu and put Date Munekiyo in charge of Yonezawa. However, Toyotomi Hideyoshi did not agree, and forced Masamune move back to Yonezawa.

Passage 1:A vast number of artifacts have been discovered from ancient Mesopotamia depicting explicit heterosexual sex. Glyptic art from the Sumerian Early Dynastic Period frequently shows scenes of frontal sex in the missionary position. In Mesopotamian votive plagues from the early second millennium BC, the man is usually shown entering the woman from behind while she bends over, drinking beer through a straw. Middle Assyrian lead votive figurines often represent the man standing and penetrating the woman as she rests on top of an altar. Scholars have traditionally interpreted all these depictions as scenes of ritual sex, but they are more likely to be associated with the cult of Inanna, the goddess of sex and prostitution. Many sexually explicit images were found in the temple of Inanna at Assur, which also contained models of male and female sexual organs, including stone phalli, which may have been worn around the neck as an amulet or used to decorate cult statues, and clay models of the female vulva.\n Passage 2:He had hoped to redshirt during the 2011 season, which was his freshman year, so that he could add size.

Nordenski\u00f6ld overwintered at Snow Hill Island, while Antarctic returned to the Falklands. The following summer Larsen brought her south, intending to retrieve the Nordenski\u00f6ld party, but she became trapped in ice which eventually crushed her hull, forcing Larsen and his crew to overwinter in a hastily constructed shelter on Paulet Island.

He held the incumbency of the church until 1844, when he was granted the perpetual curacy of Christ Church, Clifton Down, and he oversaw the rebuilding of that church. He was instituted to the living of Clifton, Bristol, in 1847, and oversaw the building of St Paul's Church, Clifton, Bristol, consecrated in 1853, and St Peter\u2019s Church, Clifton, consecrated in 1855.\n Passage 3:Wasson was born Isabel Deming Bassett in Brooklyn, NY on January 11, 1897, daughter of urban planner Edward Bassett and Annie Preston Bassett, and sister of inventor and engineer Preston Bassett. Wasson graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Wellesley College in 1918, majoring in history so she could take a wide range of science courses. She took classes in geology after graduation at the University of Chicago and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She met her future husband, petroleum geologist Theron Wasson, whom she married in 1920, while working towards a master's degree in geology at Columbia University, which she finished in 1934. They had three children: Elizabeth W. Bergstrom, a biologist; Edward B. Wasson, a petroleum geologist; and Anne Harney Gallagher, an art historian. Wasson worked as a petroleum geologist in her husband's office at the Pure Oil Company from the early 1920s until 1928. She published two scholarly articles on geology, one co-authored with her husband about an oil field discovered by Pure Oil in 1914, and another by herself about the ages of rock formations in Ohio and new terminology for them; the latter was cited in a number of other papers and a recent book. After 1928 she spent over 50 years in River Forest, IL, teaching science in the local public schools, lecturing, bird watching (ornithology), and mentoring generations of young naturalists. She was quoted in this 1986 Chicago Tribune article as an expert on local geology at age 89. She was honored for her contributions to local history in 1982 when the Wasson Room was named after her in a local school to hold local history resources. Her interests included archaeology; she discovered a Native American religious mound in Thatcher Woods, near her house in River Forest, in the 1930s. An article about her discovery called her \"the one who started the environmental education movement in America back in the 1920s and '30s.\" Theron and Isabel divorced in 1953 and she did not remarry. From 1953-1954, Wasson served as President of the Chicago Ornithological Society. Wasson also taught classes at the Morton Arboretum in Lisle, Illinois. She died in La Grange Park, IL, in 1994.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:In his will Johns Hopkins (1795-1873) left his summer home and estate, Clifton, then northeast of Baltimore, off the Harford Road, to the university for its new campus along with $7 million, split between the university and a hospital, also named for him. One of his provisions was that only interest obtained from his stock in the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad could be used to build facilities for the university. Unfortunately, after Johns Hopkins' death, the B&O Railroad fell into mismanagement; its eventual financial collapse was hastened by the Financial Panic and Recession of 1893 and the stock's value declined drastically. Therefore, the original campus of the university was established by first President Daniel Coit Gilman in downtown Baltimore along North Howard Street, between West Center, Little Ross, and West Monument Streets on the west side of the Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood, where buildings were already available. However, this location did not permit room for growth and soon the trustees began to look for a place to move. Eventually, Hopkins would relocate to the former Homewood House and Estate of Charles Carroll, Jr. (son of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, 1737-1832) built 1801-1803, and the later Wyman Villa estate of JHU Board member William Wyman, built in the 1880s. Here JHU created the park-like main campus of Hopkins Homewood, set on 140 acres (0.57\u00a0km\u00b2) in what today lies between the north Baltimore neighborhoods of Charles Village (begun in the 1870s, and then known as Peabody Heights) to the east, the planned suburban-style communities of Guilford (established 1913) and Roland Park (established early 1890s) to the north, and to the west, the mill towns of Hampden-Woodberry along the Jones Falls stream valleys and tributary Stony Run through Wyman Park and the Wyman Park Dell.\n Passage 2:Zeta Aurigae was first recognized as a spectroscopic binary by William Hammond Wright while analyzing photographic plates taken at Lick Observatory between 1898 and 1908. This star is among those earlier described by Antonia Maury as having a composite spectrum. The first orbit was determined in 1924 by William Edmund Harper using measurements taken at Dominion Observatory, his orbital elements are very similar to the most recent determinations. Harper also noticed that the composite nature of the spectrum had disappeared on the one plate when the K type primary was nearest the sun indicating a possible eclipse. In 1932 the eclipsing binary nature of the system was confirmed by Paul Guthnick, Heribert Schneller and independently Josef Hopmann.\n Passage 3:Although nominally under Seleucid control, Pergamon under Philetaerus enjoyed considerable autonomy. However, upon his succession, Eumenes, perhaps with the encouragement of Ptolemy II, who was at war with the Seleucids, revolted, defeating the Seleucid king Antiochus I near the Lydian capital of Sardis in 261 BC. He was thus able to free Pergamon, and greatly increase the territories under his control. In his new possessions, he established garrison posts in the north at the foot of Mount Ida called Philetaireia after his adoptive father, and in the east, northeast of Thyatira near the sources of the river Lycus, called Attaleia after his grandfather, and he extended his control south of the river Ca\u00efcus to the Gulf of Cyme as well. Demonstrating his independence, he began to strike coins with the portrait of Philetaerus, while his predecessor had still depicted Seleucus I Nicator.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

He came back in 1982 and played nine games, but the team folded at the end of the season. He then signed with the Montreal Manic, but that team collapsed at the end of the 1983 season. On November 10, 1983, the Fort Lauderdale Strikers purchased his contract from the Manic. The Strikers sent Ion to the Tulsa Roughnecks during the 1984 pre-season. When the NASL collapsed at the end of the season, Ion moved to the Los Angeles Lazers of the Major Indoor Soccer League. He remained with the Lazers until March 26, 1987 when the team traded him to the Minnesota Strikers in exchange for Thompson Usiyan. He finished the season with the Strikers. On October 2, 1987, the Strikers traded him to the San Diego Sockers in exchange for draft picks and cash. On November 6, 1987, the Sockers waived Ion during the pre-season as part of a salary reduction move. The Chicago Sting quickly signed him and he spent the 1987\u20131988 season in Chicago. The Sting, facing financial collapse, released Ion and ten other players on June 2, 1988. Ion then moved to the Kansas City Comets for two seasons.

Vorb takes them aboard his saucer and they travel to the present, dropping them off in New York City, which at that moment is celebrating the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. The dinosaurs pretend to be inflatable balloons to sneak along with the parade, but Rex mistakes one of the real dinosaur balloons to be his Allosaurus friend Worgul. The ruse is broken as a result of him accidentally popping \"Worgul\" and the dinosaurs flee as the crowd panics in sight of them. The police come to capture the dinosaurs soon after, but the helpful curator of the American Museum of Natural History, Dr. Miriam Bleeb, takes the dinosaurs in, and hides them from the cops by having them pretend to be life-size model dinosaurs. This satisfies the police, who leave to search for the dinosaurs elsewhere, and the curator lets them stay for the night. She reads them a bedtime story about a trilobite who wanted to walk on land, while the dinosaurs watch out the window, unsure about their future. \n Passage 3:A Dish With One Spoon, also known as One Dish One Spoon, is a law used by indigenous peoples of the Americas since at least 1142 CE to describe an agreement for sharing hunting territory among two or more nations. People are all eating out of the single dish, that is, all hunting in the shared territory. One spoon signifies that all Peoples sharing the territory are expected to limit the game they take to leave enough for others, and for the continued abundance and viability of the hunting grounds into the future. Sometimes the Indigenous language word is rendered in English as bowl or kettle rather than dish. The Dish With One Spoon phrase is also used to denote the treaty or agreement itself. In particular, a treaty made between the Anishinaabe and Haudenosaunee nations at Montr\u00e9al in 1701, as part of the Great Peace of Montreal is usually called the Dish With One Spoon treaty and its associated wampum belt the Dish With One Spoon wampum.

His election was only possible, considering the number of votes he had in 2010 elections, through the so-called \"voto de legenda\" (party vote), a constitutional mechanism that allows candidates who don't have a large number of votes to be elected through votes of another highly voted candidate of the same party. In Wyllys's case, the votes of another congressman of Socialism and Liberty Party, Chico Alencar, who was one of the most voted in Rio de Janeiro, helped in his election. Upon occupying a seat in the Brazilian Congress, Wyllys brought his LGBT movement activism to the scene. He started working on his political platform, which was primarily focused on the fight for LGBT rights. In so doing, he ended up confronting prominent Brazilian right-wing figures, such as pastor Silas Malafaia, a famous televangelist and national president of the Assembly of God Churches, and Jair Bolsonaro, a congressman who became Wyllys's nemesis in the Brazilian Congress. Wyllys came to the point of spiting on congressman Bolsonaro during the voting of President Dilma Roussef's impeachment.

Passage 1:Kh\u00e1nh had long been regarded as an ambitious and unscrupulous officer. Following the partition of Vietnam, Kh\u00e1nh, a French-trained officer who served in the French-backed Vietnamese National Army during the First Indochina War, had rallied to support Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m, who became the first president of the anti-communist South Vietnam (Republic of Vietnam). He rose to become the deputy chief of staff in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), but his record of political loyalty was called into question. In 1960, during an attempted coup by rebel paratroopers, Kh\u00e1nh jumped over the walls of the Independence Palace and joined Di\u1ec7m during the siege, trying to negotiate an end to the stand-off with the rebels. Kh\u00e1nh parleyed with the rebels long enough for loyal forces to arrive from the outside the capital to suppress the uprising, but his critics contended that he was waiting to see which side would gain the upper hand and was not committed to Di\u1ec7m. In any case, Di\u1ec7m then promoted him to be the commander of II Corps. In his younger days, Kh\u00e1nh had joined the Vi\u1ec7t Minh but then defected to the French colonial army after a year.

Coated suture, such as Vicryl, generally breaks down at a rate predicted to correspond with tissue healing, but is hastened in the presence of bacteria. In the absence of other known metabolic factors which inhibit healing and may have contributed to suture dehiscence, sub-acute infection should be suspected and the protocol of obtaining wound cultures followed by treatment with the appropriate antibiotics should be undertaken. Dehiscence can also be caused by inadequate undermining (cutting the skin away from the underlying tissues) of the wound during surgery, excessive tension on the wound edges caused by lifting or straining, or the wound being located on a highly mobile or high tension area such as the back, shoulders or legs. Individuals with Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome also commonly experience wound dehiscence. Risk factors can include any of the above as well as obesity, smoking, previous scarring, surgical error, cancer, chronic use of corticosteroids and increased abdominal pressure. A very common cause is also use and especially overuse of nicotine in any form. Smoking should therefore be stopped a certain time before any surgery.\n Passage 3:Lovell made his debut for Wales Minor Counties in the 1998 MCCA Knockout Trophy against the Warwickshire Cricket Board.

In 1852, they founded the New York Women's State Temperance Society after Anthony was prevented from speaking at a temperance conference because she was female. In 1863, they founded the Women's Loyal National League, which conducted the largest petition drive in United States history up to that time, collecting nearly 400,000 signatures in support of the abolition of slavery. In 1866, they initiated the American Equal Rights Association, which campaigned for equal rights for both women and African Americans. In 1868, they began publishing a women's rights newspaper called The Revolution. In 1869, they founded the National Woman Suffrage Association as part of a split in the women's movement. In 1890, the split was formally healed when their organization merged with the rival American Woman Suffrage Association to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association, with Anthony as its key force. In 1876, Anthony and Stanton began working with Matilda Joslyn Gage on what eventually grew into the six-volume History of Woman Suffrage. The interests of Anthony and Stanton diverged somewhat in later years, but the two remained close friends.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

The word Mriga, in many Indian languages including Malayalam, not only stands for deer, but for all animals and animal instincts (Mriga Thrishna). Shiva, as Mrigavyadha, is the one who destroys the animal instincts in human beings. In the epic Ramayana, Dasharatha, the father of Rama, is said to have the ability to hunt in the dark. During one of his hunting expeditions, he accidentally killed Shravana, mistaking him for game. During Rama's exile in the forest, Ravana kidnapped his wife, Sita, from their hut, while Rama was asked by Sita to capture a golden deer, and his brother Lakshman went after him.

On 14 August 1812 he was appointed captain of HMS Cressy of 74 guns, and given a piece of plate by the officers of HMS Pyramus. After serving in the North Sea under Admiral Sir William Young, Dashwood escorted a convoy to the West Indies, whence he returned with another of equal importance. At the review of the fleet at Spithead, in the summer of 1814, he steered the Royal barge. Afterwards he took part, commanding HMS Norge of 74 guns, in the Battle of New Orleans, where he assisted Admiral Pulteney Malcolm in the debarkation of the army, being reported by Sir Alexander Cochrane. He was also present at the Battle of Lake Borgne, where a few gunboats of the Norge, in company with other small vessels, captured five American gunboats. In 1815, when at anchor in Port Royal, his ship was struck by lightning, which broke the main-topgallant-mast in three pieces, shivered the maintop-mast and brought the mizentop-mast and topgallant-mast down on to deck. In 1821 he was given command of HMS Windsor Castle of 74 guns, and HMS Impregnable, of 104 guns, as Cochrane's flag-captain. He recommissioned Windsor Castle on 4 January 1822, as part of the guard-ships in Hamoaze. In 1825 he was put onto half-pay, and was made a rear-admiral on 22 July 1830.

Consequently, on 22 September 1847, the Admiralty promoted him posthumously to the rank of admiral.\n Passage 2:The tercentenary was kicked off in Imperial Capital St. Petersburg on a rainy February morning. The event had been on everyones' lips for several weeks leading up the actual date, and dignitaries from the whole of the Empire had gathered in the capital's grand hotels: princes from the Baltic and Poland, high-priests from Armenia and Georgia in the Caucasus, and mullahs and tribal chiefs from Central Asia alongside the Khan of Khiva and the Emir of Bukhara. Additionally there was a large group of visitors from the provinces and workers, which left the usual well-dressed promenaders of the Winter Palace outnumbered. The city was bustling with these visitors, and Nevsky Prospect experienced the worst traffic jams in history, due to the converging of cars, carriages and trams. The streets themselves were decorated in the Imperial colors of blue, red and white, statues were dressed up with ribbons and garlands, and portraits of the line of Tsars going all the way back to the Romanov dynasty's founder Michael were hung up on the facades of banks and stores. Over tram lines were chains of light hung up, which spelled out 'God Save the Tsar' or portrayed the Romanov double-headed eagle with '1613\u20131913' spelled out underneath it. For many of the provincial visitors this was their first sight of electric light, and they stood in wonder of the 'columns, arcs and obelisks of light'.\n Passage 3:By 775, one of the military governors who had only nominally been submissive to Emperor Daizong, Tian Chengsi the military governor of Weibo Circuit (\u9b4f\u535a, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), had particularly offended not only the imperial government but also his fellow warlords\u2014by seizing much of Zhaoyi Circuit (\u662d\u7fa9, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan) after the death of its military governor Xue Song in 773; by looking down on Li Zhengji the military governor of Pinglu Circuit (\u5e73\u76e7, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong) and Li Baochen the military governor of Chengde (\u6210\u5fb7, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei); and by killing Li Baochen's brother Li Baozheng (\u674e\u5bf6\u6b63), who was also his son-in-law, after his own son Tian Wei (\u7530\u7dad) died after colliding with Li Baozhen while playing polo. Li Baochen and Li Zhengji thus offered to attack Tian, and Emperor Daizong decided to take this opportunity to destroy the rebellious Tian. As Zhu Tao was then submissive to the imperial government, he joined forces with Li Baochen and another general loyal to the imperial government, Xue Jianxun (\u859b\u517c\u8a13), to attack Weibo from the north, while Li Zhengji and Li Zhongchen attacked from the south. The joint forces had initial successes, but when Zhu and Li Baochen attacked Cang Prefecture (\u6ec4\u5dde, in modern Cangzhou, Hebei), which was defended by Tian's cousin Tian Tingjie (\u7530\u5ead\u73a0), they could not capture it quickly. Meanwhile, Tian Chengsi had persuaded Li Zhengji to withdraw with flattery. In addition, Li Baochen was offended when an imperial eunuch, Ma Chengqian (\u99ac\u627f\u5029), who had visited Li Baochen's army, was so dissatisfied with Li Baochen's gift to him that he threw it on the ground, and Tian was also able to use hoaxes to persuade Li Baochen that if he joined forces with Tian to attack Lulong, he would be successful. Li Baochen thus turned against Zhu, launching a surprise attack on him, but was unable to kill Zhu, effectively ending any hopes of the campaign against Tian and subsequently creating an enmity between the Chengde and Lulong Circuits. Emperor Daizong was subsequently forced to reaccept Tian Chengsi's nominal submission.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

From 1911 he studied under Jean Perrin until he left for the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU), in 1912. At LMU, he studied theoretical physics with Arnold Sommerfeld. Just a few months before Brillouin's arrival at LMU, Max von Laue had conducted his experiment showing X-ray diffraction in a crystal lattice. In 1913, he went back to France to study at the University of Paris and it was in this year that Niels Bohr submitted his first paper on the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom. From 1914 until 1919, during World War I, he served in the military, developing the valve amplifier with G. A. Beauvais. At the conclusion of the war, he returned to the University of Paris to continue his studies with Paul Langevin, and was awarded his Docteur \u00e8s science in 1920. Brillouin's thesis jury was composed of Langevin, Marie Curie, and Jean Perrin and his thesis topic was on the quantum theory of solids. In his thesis, he proposed an equation of state based on the atomic vibrations (phonons) that propagate through it. He also studied the propagation of monochromatic light waves and their interaction with acoustic waves, i.e., scattering of light with a frequency change, which became known as Brillouin scattering.\n Passage 2:The 69th Academy Awards ceremony, organized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) took place on March 24, 1997, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles beginning at 6:00\u00a0p.m. PST / 9:00\u00a0p.m. EST.

This also served as the launch event for DVD, with its U.S. launch being on the same day as the ceremony.\n Passage 3:Indian Supercomputer design experience started first with C-DOT's CHIPPS - C-DOT High Performance Parallel Processing System. It was designed to work with a maximum of 192 nodes and later the Technology, Architecture, Design, and the Product's Hardware, Software, and Firmware were transferred to a similarly formed autonomous organization in Pune which was then called 'C-DACT' in the first place to refer to 'Centre for Development of Advanced Computing Technology' as it was intended originally to sound synonymous with C-DOT, but it was later renamed to C-DAC with 5 characters similar to that of C-DOT. CHIPPS was the base platform of the Indian Supercomputer Revolution initiated in 1988 and pursued more vigorously during the start of the 1991. Then, 'CHIPPS' which used Inmos T800 Transputer Architecture and Design in a massively parallel processing structure was augmented and was renamed to call it 'PARAM' by the policy makers of C-DAC though the original architects and the original designers of C-DOT opposed to the renaming process because 'PARAM' refers to GOD in Indian Root Language TAMIL and its ancient versions including Sanskrit.

He graduated from the University of Moscow with a degree in law, then worked in the civil service until 1893. During the Russo-Japanese War he organized relief work in the East and in 1905 joined the liberal Constitutional Democratic Party. A year later he won election to the First Duma, and was nominated for a ministerial position. He became chairman of the All-Russian Union of Zemstvos in 1914, and in 1915 he became a leader of the Union of Zemstvos as well as a member of Zemgor, a joint committee of the Union of Zemstvos and the Union of Towns that helped supply the military and tend to the wounded from World War I.

The race organisation changed with the Manx Motor Cycle Club (MMCC) replaced by ACU Events Ltd a subsidiary of the Auto-Cycle Union (ACU). A contract for the official course vehicles was awarded to Audi in a 3-year deal to celebrate the win by the pre-war Audi satellite company DKW by Ewald Kluge in the 1938 Isle of Man TT Races. A further contract was awarded to Yamaha UK to provide motor-cycles and support for the TT Travelling Marshalls.

His father was a furrier originally from a Yorkshire family that, for three generations, had been supporters of the Evangelical movement in the Church of England, and an author of a metrical translation of the Old Testament Psalms. His mother was a Langhorne, related to John Langhorne, the poet and translator of Plutarch. At twelve, Jowett was placed on the foundation of St Paul's School (then in St Paul's Churchyard) where he soon gained a reputation as a precocious classical scholar. Aged eighteen he was awarded an open scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, where he remained for the rest of his life. He went up in 1836, and was quickly recognized as one of the leading Oxford dons of his generation, made a Fellow while still an undergraduate in 1838; he graduated with first-class honours in 1839. This was at the height of the Oxford Tractarian movement: through the friendship of W. G. Ward he was drawn for a time in the direction of High Anglicanism; but a stronger and more lasting influence was that of the Arnold school, represented by A. P. Stanley. The controversy caused Jowett to withdraw from High Table at college to lodgings in Broad Street.\n Passage 3:The Basque Country was one of the main sites of battles during the First Carlist War, a civil war between supporters of the Spanish regent Maria Christina, known as liberals, and those of the late king's brother Carlos of Borb\u00f3n, known as Carlists. The Carlists were particularly focused on capturing Bilbao, a liberal and economic bastion in northern Spain.

Finally, Beccacece would end in the tenth place with three wins, seven draws and five losses and his continuity was heavily questioned during the Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario break.\n Passage 2:The design of the meeting house is unusual, having swayed away from the designs of traditional Quaker meeting houses. It was a result of the reunification of the two groups of Quakers that had initially separated from a schism in 1827, where two thirds of Quakers abandoned the philosophies of their founder, George Fox, and instead turned to the ideals taught by Long Island preacher, Elias Hicks. By 1926, when it was time to construct a new meeting house in Poughkeepsie, the number of local \u201cHicksite\u201d Quakers was diminishing, so many had joined the Orthodox Quakers. Alfred Bussel, a New York City architect, was chosen to design a meeting house that appealed to all members. Since he had studied at Haverford College, a Quaker school, Bussell was very familiar with the Society of Friends traditions. One branch had suggested a church-like structure with steeple, organ, and stained-glass windows, while the other wanted a more traditional style meeting house, i.e. evoking simplicity, equality, community, and peace. The design therefore was a unity between the two branches, a sign of what was to come with the official reunification in the 1950s. The result is a simple, colonial revival building without stained-glass or any sort of liturgical ornamentation or symbols, as per Quaker tradition, but had a single front door (Quaker meeting houses had separate entrances for men and women) and an interior layout akin to a church; a central aisle with rows of pews on either side all facing the front of the building.\n Passage 3:Henry Denis Hauenstein, MM (3 May 1881 \u2013 6 December 1940) was an Australian national representative rower and a World War I infantry officer.

Both Frankie Laine and Elvis Presley, among others, recorded versions of Robbins' song \"You Gave Me a Mountain\", with Laine's recording reaching the pop and adult contemporary charts in 1969. Though Elvis never recorded any of Robbins' songs in the studio, he was a big fan and recorded \"You Gave Me a Mountain\" live in concert several times; it appeared on 15 Presley albums. Johnny Cash recorded a version of \"Big Iron\" as part of his American Recordings series, which is included in the Cash Unearthed box set. Cash also recorded other songs by Robbins, including \"I Couldn't Keep From Crying\", \"Kate\" and \"Song Of The Patriot\". He held Robbins in high esteem, having him guest several times on his network TV show. \"Big Iron\" was also covered by Mike Ness on his album Under the Influences, on which he paid homage to country music artists. The song, originally released on Robbins' 1959 album Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs, gained renewed popularity following its use in the video game .\n Passage 3:In the spring of 1902, Bulgaria, an Ottoman vassal state which was interested in acquiring Macedonia, signed a military convention with Russia. Late in the fall, Russia, supported by the United Kingdom and France, proposed to the Ottomans political reforms for the Macedonian vilayets. On 8 December, the Ottoman sultan, Abdul Hamid II, signed a decree implementing most of the reforms. In February 1903, the new Russian foreign minister, Vladimir Lamsdorf, visited Vienna and signed the so-called \"Vienna Program\" on Macedonian reforms. The program was substantially the same as the Ottoman decree of December. The immediate provocation of a new agreement at M\u00fcrzsteg was the Ilinden\u2013Preobrazhenie Uprising that broke out on 2 August. With its quick suppression, the Vienna Program lay dead. In September Tsar Nicholas II of Russia visited the Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria-Hungary at the latter's castle in M\u00fcrzsteg, Austria. The two rulers put their signatures to a new memorandum, substantially identical to the Vienna Program, which called for the appointment of one Russian and one Austro-Hungarian civil agent to oversee the reform of the administration, judiciary and local gendarmerie in the Macedonian vilayets. In all these institutions Christians were to take part. After Abdul Hamid accepted the proposal in November, Russia appointed one N. Demerik as its agent, and Austria chose one G. M\u00fcller. They began their work under H\u00fcseyin Hilmi Pasha, the Inspector-General of Macedonia, in early 1904. Under the M\u00fcrzsteg program, each Great Power appointed an advisory official to the Ottoman official in charge of reforming the gendarmerie in each province.

Film criticism began with early film magazines such as Katsud\u014d shashinkai (begun in 1909) and a full-length book written by Yasunosuke Gonda in 1914, but many early film critics often focused on chastising the work of studios like Nikkatsu and Tenkatsu for being too theatrical (using, for instance, elements from kabuki and shinpa such as onnagata) and for not utilizing what were considered more cinematic techniques to tell stories, instead relying on benshi. In what was later named the Pure Film Movement, writers in magazines such as Kinema Record called for a broader use of such cinematic techniques. Some of these critics, such as Norimasa Kaeriyama, went on to put their ideas into practice by directing such films as The Glow of Life (1918), which was one of the first films to use actresses (in this case, Harumi Hanayagi). There were parallel efforts elsewhere in the film industry. In his 1917 film The Captain's Daughter, Masao Inoue started using techniques new to the silent film era, such as the close-up and cut back. The Pure Film Movement was central in the development of the gendaigeki and scriptwriting.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

He returned to Leningrad in 1938, lecturing, completing his Ph.D. and becoming employed as a junior scientist. He joined the Lebedev Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR in Moscow as a senior scientist in 1940. In 1941 the institute was evacuated to Kazan. Under Abraham Alikhanov, he studied cosmic rays in Armenia from 1942. In 1943, he transferred to Laboratory No.2 under Igor Kurchatov as part of the Soviet project to develop nuclear weapons. Alikhanov founded Laboratory No.3 (which became the Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics (ITEP)) and Pomeranchuk worked there from 1946 (and for the rest of his life), founding and leading the Theoretical department, as well as being Professor of Theoretical Physics at the Moscow Mechanical Institute where students admired his infectious enthusiasm for his subject. Rudolf Peierls was consoled by the fact that it was \"very clever Pomeranchuk\" - and no-one else - who corrected his 1/T law for heat conduction in high-temperature condensed matter physics. His work in the 1940s was dominated by neutron research and his manuscript with Akhiezer was the basic guide for Soviet nuclear reactor construction. In 1950, he published a paper suggesting that the entropy of helium-3 as a liquid was less than as a solid. In 1950, Pomeranchuk received an order from Josef Stalin to go to Arzamas-16, located in the closed city of Sarov, Nizhny Novgorod region, to work on Soviet nuclear weaponry. Missing his family and his 'hobby physics' problems, he was advised not to apply for a revocation but wait until the order was \"forgotten.\" He returned to ITEP within a year. He continued enthusiastically with work on quantum field theory and S-matrix theory, particle collisions and Regge theory, the latter in vigorous collaboration with Vladimir Gribov. His last paper on Regge theory was published posthumously. For his work, Pomeranchuk was twice awarded the Stalin Prize (1950, 1952).

The military and civil government of Pakistan sought to utilize these militants in the Kashmir conflict against the Indian Armed Forces in accordance with the \"thousand cuts\" doctrine so as to \"bleed India\", using Pakistan's nuclear arsenal as a shield. In the 1980s cross-border terrorism started in the Kashmir region as armed and well-trained groups of terrorists were infiltrated into India through the border. Pakistan officially maintained that the terrorism in Kashmir was \"freedom struggle\" of Kashmiris and Pakistan only provided moral support to them. But this turned out to be inaccurate as Director-General of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) stated in the National Assembly of Pakistan that the ISI was sponsoring this support in Kashmir. Pakistan has used the jihadist militias to conduct an asymmetric warfare with India. The militant groups have been used not just as proxies, but predominantly as \"weapons\" against India for Pakistan's \"Bleed India\" campaign.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

By the 19th century, the once affluent parts of Bermondsey had experienced a serious decline, and became the site of notorious slums with the arrival of industrialisation, docks and migrant housing, especially along the riverside. The most notorious of the slums was known as Jacob's Island, with the boundary approximately the confluence of the Thames and subterranean River Neckinger, at St Saviour's Dock across from Shad Thames, to the west, a tidal ditch just west of George Row to the east, and another tidal ditch just north of London Street (now Wolseley Street) to the south. It was a particularly squalid rookery, and described as \"The very capital of cholera\" and \"The Venice of drains\" by The Morning Chronicle in 1849.\n Passage 2:Palman was born in ca. 1290, in Styria (present Austria), into a noble, Roman Catholic family.

That decision turned out to be shortsighted by Nickelodeon, and when proposed again to the then underutilized Disney Channel as a tie-in to the underperforming Hollywood Records (Disney Music Group), the concept proved inherently valuable enough that, as the complaint filed against Disney in 2007 in Los Angeles claimed, Rock and Roland was misappropriated by Disney and produced under the name Hannah Montana.

They arrived at the Port of Indianola in Calhoun County, Texas on the . The book Go West Greek George by Steven Dean Pastis, published in both Greek and English, specifically identifies all eight men. These pioneers were Yiorgos Caralambo (later known as Greek George), Hadji Ali (Hi Jolly, a.k.a. Philip Tedro), Mimico Teodora (Mico), Hadjiatis Yannaco (Long Tom), Anastasio Coralli (Short Tom), Michelo Georgios, Yanni Iliato, and Giorgios Costi. The Americans acquired three camels in Tunis, nine in Egypt and 21 in Smyrna: 33 in all. Ali was the lead camel driver during the US Army's experiment with the U.S. Camel Corps in using camels in the dry deserts of the Southwest. After successfully traveling round trip from Texas to California, the experiment failed, partly due to the problem that the Army's burros, horses, and mules feared the large animals, often panicking, and the tensions of the American Civil War led to Congress not approving more funds for the Corps. In 1864, the camels were finally auctioned off in Benicia, California, and Camp Verde, Texas. Ali was discharged from the Quartermaster Department of the U.S. Army at Fort McDowell in 1870.\n Passage 2:In 2009 the Taliban began moving even more men into Nawa, possibly for additional attacks against Lashkar Gah. On May 13, they launched an attack against the Afghan National Police in the district, that overwhelmed several posts. By late spring they had established a solid foothold in the district. On July 2, 2009, Marines from the 1st Battalion, 5th Marines (1/5) occupied the district as part of Operation Strike of the Sword. They set up their headquarters in Forward Operating Base Geronimo. On August 26, Lance Corporal Donald Hogan, a Marine with 1/5, threw himself in front of an improvised explosive device (IED), saving the Marines in his squad.

Parker wrote the screenplay, which was based on a story he co-wrote with Jean McGianni Celestin. Parker learned about Turner from an African-American studies course at the University of Oklahoma. He began writing the screenplay for a Nat Turner film in 2009 and had a fellowship at a lab under the Sundance Institute. While he got writing feedback from filmmakers like James Mangold, he was told that a Nat Turner film could not be produced. The Hollywood Reporter said:But what he heard instead were all the reasons a movie about Nat Turner wouldn't work: Movies with black leads don't play internationally; a period film with big fight scenes would be too expensive; it was too violent; it wouldn't work without a big box-office star leading it; Turner was too controversial\u2014after all, he was responsible for the deaths of dozens of well-off white landowners.After Parker finished his acting role in Beyond the Lights in late 2013, he told his agents he would not continue acting until he had played Nat Turner in a film. He invested $100,000 of his money to hire a production designer and to pay for location scouting in Savannah, Georgia. He met with multiple financiers, and the first to invest in the film were retired basketball player Michael Finley (who had previously invested in the film The Butler) and active basketball player Tony Parker (no relation).

He continued overland through Germany, Austria, and Serbia, to the Euxine where he felt obliged to force his ship's captain at gunpoint to take him to Constantinople as agreed, rather than a corsair port for murder or slavery. He passed through Greece without recorded incidents, and took ship for Aleppo. He narrowly saved his own life, and his servant's, in the desert by curing the chief of a band of Arabs, who were planning to murder and rob him. He stayed for some time in Baghdad, where he was presented with a valuable Arabian horse by the Ottoman governor. From Basra he took ship for Bombay, then travelled overland to Madras.

The first was 2003's Electric Utilities Act, which made some changes to the government's deregulation of the province's electricity market. Much of the debate around the bill was about whether the government's deregulation had worked well to date. The bill was passed on a party line vote, with Knight's fellow Progressive Conservatives voting unanimously in favour and the opposition Liberals and New Democrats voting unanimously against. Knight also sponsored the Securities Amendment Acts, separate bills with the same name from different years, 2005 and 2006. The first of these was designed to harmonize the securities regulation with that of other provinces. It was supported by Liberals Rick Miller and Bill Bonko, who considered it a step in the right direction. New Democrats gave it a mixed reception, with Ray Martin agreeing that it did make some improvements, but with his colleague David Eggen trying to kill it on third reading, saying that what was needed was a supra-provincial securities regulator. The 2006 edition of the Securities Amendment Act implemented further harmonization, and passed with little debate. The Securities Transfer Act of the same year consolidated and harmonized the province's rules for transferring securities, and passed with all-party support.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Richard de Percy, 5th Baron Percy (c. 1170\u20131244) (who adopted the surname Percy), was the son of Joscelin of Louvain (1121\u20131180), styled \"brother of the queen\" (referring to Adeliza of Louvain, second wife of King Henry I of England, by his wife Agnes de Perci, suo jure Baroness Percy, the heiress of the Percy estates in England.)

Passage 1:He was born in Strasbourg, served in the Breton Volunteers and then came to Nova Scotia as a Foreign Protestants with Edward Cornwallis in 1751. Pernette served as an aide-de-camp during the taking of Quebec City in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. He first settled at Halifax but later moved to the New Dublin area. He built a gristmill and a sawmill on the LaHave River and also built the first ship on the river. Pernette served as justice of the peace, deputy surveyor and was colonel in the local militia, participating in the defense of Lunenburg during the Raid on Lunenburg, Nova Scotia (1782). He also conducted a census of the area and constructed a road to Lunenburg. Pernette also operated a ferry connecting that road to the road to Liverpool. \n Passage 2:The 1916 Gulf Coast hurricane was a destructive tropical cyclone that struck the central Gulf Coast of the United States in early July 1916. It generated the highest storm surge on record in Mobile, Alabama, wrought widespread havoc on shipping, and dropped torrential rainfall exceeding . The second tropical cyclone, first hurricane, and first major hurricane \u2013 Category 3 or stronger on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson scale \u2013 of the highly active 1916 Atlantic hurricane season, the system originated in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on June 28 and moved generally toward the north-northwest. Crossing the Yucat\u00e1n Channel on July 3 as a strengthening hurricane and brushing Cuba with gusty winds, the cyclone reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 120\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h) prior to making landfall near Pascagoula, Mississippi, at 20:00 UTC on July 5. Over land, the hurricane rapidly weakened to a tropical storm, but then retained much of its remaining strength as it meandered across interior Mississippi and Alabama for several days, its northward progress impeded by a sprawling high-pressure area to the north. The system weakened into a tropical depression on June 9 and dissipated late the next day over southern Tennessee.\n Passage 3:In the second qualifying session, every driver set a lap on the option tyres except two. Lewis Hamilton still managed to take his McLaren into Q3 with the sixth fastest Q2 time on the prime tyres, and Pastor Maldonado, who did not set a timed lap. It was notable that Red Bull Racing and Ferrari needed to use options when Hamilton could use primes. Jaime Alguersuari \u2013 a man who had come from far back to score points a few times in , like his teammate did at this weekend set the slowest Q2 time and dropped out on the same row as Rubens Barrichello's Williams.

He joined 100 Squadron as a Lancaster pilot and was later moved to 550 Squadron stationed in Grimsby. He flew 36 trips over France and Germany over the course of the war, including taking part in the Nuremberg raid of March 1944 during which Bomber Command suffered its heaviest loses. He was awarded the Croix de Guerre for his involvement in bombing raids on the German Panzer training camp at Mailly-le-Camp in advance of the Normandy landings in June 1944. He also received the DFC \"for utmost fortitude, courage and devotion to duty in air operations\" during the War. By the time he left the RAF Ward Thomas had achieved the rank of flight lieutenant.\n Passage 2:Hillings\u00f8 was made a sergeant in the Royal Danish Navy in 1955, but changed to serve in the Royal Danish Army, in which he became a Lieutenant of the Danish Royal Life Guards in 1959. In 1986 he was made a colonel and became the chief of the Planning and Operations Staff in the Defence Command. In 1990, he became a Major General, and Chief of the Army. In 1991, he was made head of the newly-created Army Operational Command. In 1993 he became Lieutenant General and head of NATO's BALTAP command, and was also head of the Defence Operational Forces. He held this position until his retirement in 1995, when he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of the Dannebrog.\n Passage 3:The fruit bodies of A.\u00a0abrupta grow on the ground, typically solitary, in mixed conifer and deciduous forests, usually during autumn. The frequency with which fruit bodies appear depends on several factors, such as season, location, temperature, and rainfall. The mushroom has been described as common in the Southeastern United States; in Texas, it has been called both infrequent, and common in the Big Thicket National Preserve. Like most other Amanita species, A.\u00a0abrupta is thought to form mycorrhizal relationships with trees. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of trees, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. Amanita abrupta is widely distributed throughout eastern North America, where it has been found as far north as Quebec, Canada, and as far south as Mexico. Orson K. Miller claims to have found it in the Dominican Republic where it appeared to be growing in a mycorrizhal association with pine trees. Kuo also mentions a mycorrhizal relationship with both hardwoods and conifers, while Tulloss lists additional preferred tree hosts such as beech, birch, fir, tsuga, oak, and poplar. However, A.\u00a0abrupta has been shown experimentally to not form mycorrhizae with Virginia Pine.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:In 2006, , a first-year dramaturgy student at the University of Arts' Faculty of Dramatic Arts (FDU), wrote a script based on the \"Balada o Pi\u0161onji i \u017dugi\" track as part of an assignment in school. Though it mostly relies on \"Balada o Pi\u0161onji i \u017dugi\", the script also references other Zabranjeno pu\u0161enje songs such as \"Pamtim to kao da je bilo danas\", \"Lutka sa naslovne strane\", \"Had\u017eija il bos\", \"Murga drot\", \"Guzonjin sin\", and \"Pi\u0161onja i \u017duga u paklu droge\". \u0110ur\u0111evi\u0107 placed the plot in summer 1990 on the eve of the Yugoslavia vs. West Germany match at the 1990 FIFA World Cup with two lifelong friends from Sarajevo of differing ethno-religious backgrounds and football club loyalties (Pi\u0161onja, a Muslim who's a fan of FK Sarajevo, and \u017duga, a Serb pulling for FK \u017deljezni\u010dar) trying to get to Dubrovnik.\n Passage 2:The intention declared in the royal speech at the opening of the Chamber of resuming the war against Kemal was supported by an official report issued on January 10 of a renewal of the Greek offensive to the northeast of Smyrna and in the Brussa area, and the same day the Greeks occupied Belejik. On the following day the Greek Liberal organ Patris published a letter from Nice, where Venizelos was residing at the time, confirming the Greek statesman's final decision to retire from politics. This decision was naturally not displeasing to the supporters of King Constantine, who a little later found another cause for jubilation when the king of Italy received the newly appointed Greek minister to Rome (January 13). Thus Italy was the first among foreign Allied and neutral powers to recognize King Constantine. But the enthusiasm was soon damped by the joint representations made on the 20th to the Greek government by the British and French ministers in Athens on the transformation of the Chamber into a National Assembly. This action by the two Allied governments was declared to be based on the rights of the powers in question as guarantors of the constitution of Greece, rights which they considered as still existent, since the Treaty of S\u00e8vres, in which they were surrendered, had not yet been ratified by all the signatories. Early in February the Allied Supreme Council invited the Greek and Turkish governments to attend a conference to be held in the latter part of the month in London with the object of bringing about peace between the two countries. The invitation was coldly received in Athens, and was the cause of a split in the Dimitrios Rallis cabinet on the score of wounded personal vanities. Dimitrios Gounaris, minister of war, the real leader of the Constantino faction, who, in deference to Allied public opinion, which had stigmatized him as a pro-German, had after the defeat of the Venizelists been compelled to renounce his claims to the premiership in favor of the less compromised Rallis, after being also refused the presidency of the Greek delegation to the London conference, resigned, bringing about a ministerial crisis.\n Passage 3:He was the deputy of Montfort-l'Amaury from 28 march 1789 til 30 september 1791. He joined the Estates General (France) as its youngest member. He moved to the left side of the National Assembly, shifting from the Second Estate, the nobility. On 17 August he was appointed as the secretary of the assembly. Montmorency fought the aristocracy under the tutelage of the abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e8s. He moved the abolition of armorial bearings on 19 June 1790. Before 20 April 1792 he and Count de Narbonne, the Minister of War, went to inspect the troops. Around the Storming of the Tuileries in August Montmorency fled to Coppet to live with Mme de Sta\u00ebl and Arnail Fran\u00e7ois, marquis de Jaucourt. In January 1793 he accompanied her to Boulogne-sur-mer, when she sought refuge in England. On 17 June 1794 his brother an abott was guillotined. Montmorency started to study the church father Augustine. In May 1795 he lived in Yverdon. He returned to Paris to see his relatives. He was arrested as an \u00e9migr\u00e9 on the 26th of December, but released after a few days. Montmorency lived on an estate in Ormesson-sur-Marne.

Passage 1:Lord Haddington was succeeded accordingly by his second son Thomas, the sixth Earl. He obtained a new charter of the earldom. He sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish Representative Peer from 1716 to 1735 and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Haddingtonshire from 1716 to 1735. He was also appointed Hereditary Keeper of Holyrood Palace. His eldest son Charles Hamilton, Lord Binning, married Rachel (died 1773), daughter of George Baillie, of Mellerstain House and Jerviswood. Through this marriage Mellerstein House and the Jerviswood estate came into the Hamilton family. Lord Binning predeceased his father. Lord Haddington was therefore succeeded by his grandson, Thomas the seventh Earl (the eldest son of Lord Binning), who married Mary Lloyd, n\u00e9e Holt (great-niece of Sir John Holt, Lord Chief Justice 1689-1709). On his death the titles passed to his son Charles, the eighth Earl. He was a Scottish Representative Peer from 1807 to 1812 and Lord-Lieutenant of Haddingtonshire from 1804 to 1823. He was succeeded by his son, the ninth Earl. He was a Tory politician and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland from 1834 to 1835 and as First Lord of the Admiralty (with a seat in the cabinet) from 1841 to 1846. In 1827, one year before he succeeded his father in the earldom, he was created Baron Melros, of Tyninghame in the County of Haddington, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.\n Passage 2:Born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1887, the son of an insurance executive, Wright grew up in the Toronto neighbourhood of Rosedale. He was educated at Upper Canada College where he also became head boy. Despite wearing glasses, he excelled in sports and his spirit of adventure saw him spend some of his youth prospecting and canoeing in Canada's unmapped Far North. He studied Physics at the University of Toronto and won a scholarship for postgraduate study at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, England, undertaking research in cosmic rays at the Cavendish Laboratory from 1908-10. There he met Douglas Mawson, who had recently returned from Shackleton's 1907-9 British Antarctic Expedition, known as the Nimrod Expedition. Upon learning of Scott's forthcoming expedition to the geographic South Pole, Wright applied to join but was rejected. Undaunted, he walked from Cambridge to London, where he applied in person; this time, Scott accepted, and Wright was hired as expedition glaciologist and assistant physicist.\n Passage 3:Just south of the village center is Mount Prospect, summer home to Senator John W. Weeks, who sponsored congressional legislation creating White Mountain National Forest. In 1910, he purchased several farms to assemble the estate. It is now Weeks State Park, which features a fire lookout and his mansion, open for tours during the summer. A ski rope tow operates on the slope in winter. Many of the White Mountains and Green Mountains can be seen from the stone observation tower built in 1912 atop the summit. The Presidential Range is to the southeast, with the Franconia Range to the south. Mount Weeks, elevation , is in the Kilkenny Range to the northeast.

In 1988, Threfall played Second XI cricket for Sussex, with him also making his first-class debut for the county in that season against Somerset at the Recreation Ground, Bath. He played regularly for the Sussex Second XI, but would only make two further first-class appearances for the county, against the touring Sri Lankans in 1990 and Cambridge University in 1991. He never batted in his three first-class appearances, but with the ball he took 7 wickets at an average of 18.57, with best figures of 3/45. He also made a single List A appearance for the county against the touring Zimbabweans in 1990. He ended Sussex's innings of 233/8 unbeaten on 17, while in the Zimbabweans innings he took figures of 3/40 from 10 overs, with Sussex winning by 95 runs.

She has released 13 studio albums, eight of which have individually achieved worldwide multi-platinum status. The Queen of Hip-Hop Soul and Queen of R&B (publications often refer to her as both honorific titles), Mary J. Blige is uniquely credited as the first singer to release an album singing over hip-hop beats, which created the genre \"hip hop soul\" which fuses elements of soul, R&B and gospel style vocals over hip hop beats. Blige's genre-changing sound, in many ways, changed and shaped the sound for modern day R&B and blue-eyed soul artists. In September 1999, Rolling Stone bestowed her first album, What's the 411? (1992), as \"genre-creating\". Her discography consists of 14 top 10 Billboard 200 studio albums, two live albums, two remix albums and over eighty singles\u2014including more than 20 as a featured artist. In 2009, Billboard magazine ranked Blige as the most successful female R&B/hip-hop artist of the past 25 years. In March 2017, Billboard magazine ranked her 2006 song \"Be Without You\" as the most successful R&B/hip-hop song of all time, as it spent an unparalleled 75 weeks on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, 15 of those weeks at number one. In 2011, VH1 ranked Blige as the 80th greatest artist of all time. Moreover, she was ranked 100th on the list of \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\" by Rolling Stone magazine.

Back-to-back singles by Edwin Encarnacion and Jose Bautista made it 2\u20130. After Russell Martin walked to load the bases, Troy Tulowitzki cleared them with a triple. Rangers' starter Cole Hamels threw 42 pitches that inning, the most pitches in an inning he had ever thrown. Next inning, Melvin Upton Jr.'s leadoff home run made it 6\u20130.

Nehru maintained friendly relations with both the United States and the Soviet Union, and encouraged the People's Republic of China to join the global community of nations. In 1956, when the Suez Canal Company was seized by the Egyptian government, an international conference voted 18\u20134 to take action against Egypt. India was one of the four backers of Egypt, along with Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and the USSR. India had opposed the partition of Palestine and the 1956 invasion of the Sinai by Israel, the United Kingdom and France, but did not oppose the Chinese direct control over Tibet, and the suppression of a pro-democracy movement in Hungary by the Soviet Union. Although Nehru disavowed nuclear ambitions for India, Canada and France aided India in the development of nuclear power stations for electricity. India also negotiated an agreement in 1960 with Pakistan on the just use of the waters of seven rivers shared by the countries. Nehru had visited Pakistan in 1953, but owing to political turmoil in Pakistan, no headway was made on the Kashmir dispute.\n Passage 3:Romer was appointed a judge of the Chancery Division of the High Court in 1922, in succession to Sir Arthur Frederick Peterson, and received the customary knighthood the same year.

He graduated from Linton High School in Schenectady in 1959 and attended Syracuse University for two years. He signed with the Chicago Cubs as a pitcher-infielder in 1961. During a season split between the Class B Northwest League and the Class D Sophomore League, Connors batted only .226 with no home runs and 32\u00a0runs batted in while hurling 29 innings as a pitcher. In 1962 in the Class D Florida State League, Connors was converted to pitcher-catcher, and improved his batting mark to .296 with two homers and 35 RBI. He also increased his pitching load to 64 innings and posted a sparkling 2.64\u00a0earned run average. In 1963, back in the Northwest League, he became a full-time pitcher, winning 12 games and notching 138 strike outs.\n Passage 2:Dew was born in Sumner, Washington, and began his acting career in the mid 1930s, appearing in small film roles. His first film roles of any substance were as Captain Kendall in Military Academy (1940) and Henchman French in Dude Cowboy (1941). His first starring role was as Scott Yager in Red River Robin Hood (1942). This was followed by two leading roles for Republic Pictures in the westerns Beyond the Last Frontier (1943) and Raiders of Sunset Pass (1943). Afterwards Dew worked for Universal Pictures for the next decade, appearing mostly in supporting roles. Many of the pictures he made with Universal during the 1940s were with Rod Cameron, such as Trigger Trail (1944) and Renegades of the Rio Grande (1945).\n Passage 3:Pratt gave much of his time and wealth to Baltimore\u2019s cultural and charitable institutions. He served as a trustee of the Peabody Institute, founded in 1857, which began construction in 1860 and opened/dedicated in 1866, in the presence of its benefactor, fellow Bay Stater and friend, George Peabody, (1795-1869), who also formerly made his original fortune in \"The Monumental City\" during the 20 years of his first business, 1815-1835, at the time was the wealthiest man in the Americas. The new Institute's various cultural programs that were to be established of an art gallery, reference library, series of educational lectures, a music conservatory, and system of scholarship honors (engrossed certificates and monetary prizes with gold or silver medals) for honored graduates of the city's new public high schools (\"Peabody Prizes\"), which were continued for 130 years. A decade later, nine years after his death, the east wing of the Institute with its noted gallery of cast-iron balconies for the book stacks, ceiling skylight and impressive architecture by Edmund G. Lind for its scholarly, non-circulating reference library, (now known as The George Peabody Library) was completed in 1878, and was one of the reasons that the first President Daniel Coit Gilman of the new Johns Hopkins University opening in February 1876, temporarily located its first campus a few blocks away on North Howard Street, rather than at Hopkins' summer/country estate of \"Clifton\" in northeast Baltimore. These acts of generous philanthropy further inspired Pratt, by his friend and fellow Massachusetts-born and Baltimore industrialist/financier George Peabody, [1795-1869], who earned his fortune beginning during his earlier twenty years in the city during 1815-1835 and his other friend and fellow merchant Johns Hopkins, (1795-1873). He founded the \"House of Reformation and Instruction for Colored Children\" which he offered on his former farm property at Cheltenham (in Prince George's County), and the Maryland School for the Deaf and Dumb located at Frederick on South Market Street. In 1865, he donated a free school and public library (The Pratt Free School in 1856, and further endowed upon its 1865 incorporation - which later became a public grammar school preparing students for advancement to the local Middleborough High School, founded 1873), to his hometown of Middleborough in Massachusetts.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:After the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, the rivalry between Iran and Pakistan intensified. After 1989, both state's policies in Afghanistan became even more divergent as Pakistan, under Benazir Bhutto, explicitly supported Taliban forces in Afghanistan. This resulted in a major breach, with Iran becoming closer to India. Pakistan's support for the Sunni Taliban organisation in Afghanistan became a problem for Shia Iran which opposed a Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. The Pakistani backed Taliban fought the Iranian backed Northern Alliance in Afghanistan and gained control of 90 percent of that country. As noted by a Pakistani foreign service officer, it was difficult to maintain good relations with Israel, Saudi Arabia, the United States, and Iran at the same time, given Iran's long history of rivalry with these states. In 1995 Bhutto paid a lengthy state visit to Iran, which greatly relaxed relations. At a public meeting she spoke highly of Iran and Iranian society. However, increasing activity by Shia militants in Pakistan strained relations further. This was followed by the Taliban's capture of the city of Mazar-i-Sharif in 1998, in which thousands of Shias were massacred, according to Amnesty International. The most serious breach in relations came in 1998, after Iran accused Taliban Afghanistan of taking 11 Iranian diplomats, 35 Iranian truck drivers and an Iranian journalist hostage, and later killing them all. Iran massed over 300,000 troops on the Afghan border and threatened to attack the Taliban government, which it had never recognized. This strained relations with Pakistan, as the Taliban were seen as Pakistan's key allies. In May 1998, Iran criticised Pakistan for its nuclear testing in the Chagai region, and held Pakistan accountable for global \"atomic proliferation\". New Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif acknowledged his country's nuclear capability on 7 September 1997.\n Passage 2:The son of an aristocratic family, de Hauteclocque graduated from the \u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr, the French military academy, in 1924. After service with the French Occupation of the Ruhr and in Morocco, he returned to Saint-Cyr as an instructor. He was awarded the croix de guerre des th\u00e9\u00e2tres d'op\u00e9rations ext\u00e9rieures for leading goumiers in an attack on caves and ravines on Bou Amdoun on 11 August 1933. During the Second World War he fought in the Battle of France. He then became one of the first to make his way to Britain to fight with the Free French under General Charles de Gaulle, adopting the nom de guerre of Leclerc so that his wife and children would not be put at risk if his name appeared in the papers. He was sent to French Equatorial Africa, where he rallied local leaders to the Free French cause, and led a force against Gabon, whose leaders supported Vichy France. From Chad he led raids into Italian-controlled Libya. After his forces captured Kufra, he had his men swear an oath known today as the Serment de Koufra, in which they pledged to fight on until their flag flew over the Strasbourg Cathedral.\n Passage 3:Fort Mercer was a fort on the Delaware River in New Jersey constructed by the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. Built by Polish engineer Thaddeus Kosciuszko under the command of George Washington, Fort Mercer was built in 1777 to block the approach to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in concert with Fort Mifflin on the Pennsylvania side. Fort Mercer was located in an area called Red Bank, in what is now the borough of National Park, Gloucester County, New Jersey. The fort was named in honor of Brigadier General Hugh Mercer who had died earlier that year at the Battle of Princeton.

He was mayor from November 1996 to November 1999, a time when tourism was over-taking logging and fishing as the town's dominant industry. Fraser was supportive of the application to the United Nations to designate Clayoquot Sound as a biosphere site; Clayoquot Sound was listed as a Biosphere Reserve in 2000. Fraser was the subject of a complaint filed at the British Columbia Ombudsman by one of his councillors, Ken Gibson. The mayor and council issued a resolution stating that Gibson had violated conflict-of-interest laws, using his position on council to influence zoning restrictions on his property. Gibson challenged the resolution at the BC Supreme Court which ruled in Gibson's favour, ordering that Gibson be re-instated as a councillor. The mayor and council voted in favour of appealing the decision but the Court of Appeal upheld the decision. Fraser was defeated in his attempt at re-election as mayor. In 2000, the former mayor was appointed to Tourism BC's board of directors and to the Clayoquot Sound Central Region Board which considered pre-treaty land use-related decisions.

The resulting piece 21 Days in the Cairngorms (2010) featured two group slow-walks, as well as a group of walkers to see Fulton off on the first day of his twenty-day journey, and new and unusual experience for Fulton. This project inspired the development of the Walking Institute and a further focus on walking as an artistic medium. In 2012 Ethiopian artist Mihret Kebede developed Slow Marathon, an artistic project in response to her inability to walk from her hometown of Addis Ababa to Huntly. The project consisted of an accumulative marathon that included miles donated remotely by international participants, as well as two twenty-six mile walks in Huntly and Addis Ababa. Ultimately, over five-hundred individuals participated in the project and donated 14172.4 miles, a total of 540 marathons. The project has since become an annual event, created in conjunction with artists working with Devon Projects The 2013 Slow Marathon, Cabrach to Huntly, was held on John Muir Day and served as the official launch of the Institute. The 2014 event started at the Glenkindie on the edge of the Cairngorms National Park. Other Walking Institute projects have included: In the Footsteps of Nan Shepherd: a long distance walk looking by Simone Kenyon at issues, plights and pleasures of women walking in wilderness; Huntly Perambulator, a series of walks by Clare Qualmann looking at walking with prams; Hielan\u2019 Ways, a programme that included poetry (Alec Finlay), music (Paul Anderson) and art (Simone Kenyon, Gillian Russel).

More reinforcements were raised from the Christian Arab tribes in the region between Al-Hirah and Ullais. The Rashidun Caliphate army under Khalid crossed the river Khaseef and approached Ullais frontally. Emperor Ardsheer meanwhile sent orders to Bahman Jaduya to proceed to Ullais and take command of Arab contingents there and stop the Muslims advance at Ullais. Bahman sent his senior general Jaban with the imperial army to Ullais with orders to avoid battle until Bahman Jaduya himself arrived. As Jaban set off with the army, Bahman Jaduya returned to Ctesiphon to discuss certain matters with the Emperor. He arrived at Ctesiphon to find Emperor Ardsheer very ill and remained in attendance on him. By now the Persians and Arabs had realised that the Muslims' objective was Al-Hirah.

Passage 1:Born in what is now Opava in Silesia, Weidt was the daughter of composer and Kapellmeister Heinrich Weidt, who was one of her first teachers, along with Rosa Papier. For most of her career she was on the roster of the Vienna State Opera, beginning in 1903 and continuing until 1926. She first succeeded Sophie Sedlmair, who was retiring, and soon began sharing major Wagner roles with Anna Bahr-Mildenburg. She also became known for her portrayal of Leonore in Fidelio, and she created for Vienna the Marschallin in Der Rosenkavalier. For Milan she was the first Kundry. Between 1908 and 1910 she appeared in Munich. During the 1910\u201311 season Weidt was on the roster of the Metropolitan Opera, singing Br\u00fcnnhilde in both Die Walk\u00fcre and Siegfried and Elisabeth in Tannh\u00e4user. In 1912 she was singing in Buenos Aires. She won praise from Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek for her portrayal of Kostelni\u010dka in Jen\u016ffa at its Vienna premiere in 1918.

She has experience in a wide variety of scientific topics, including acid rain, carbon sequestration, climate change, forest ecosystems, nitrogen cycling and retention, and watershed processes. Goodale is an ecosystem ecologist whose research focuses mainly on forest ecosystems, including the role that forests play in important water cycle processes and regulation of atmospheric greenhouse gases, as well as the impacts that afflict forest ecosystems as a result of human activities. Goodale specifically focuses on nutrients like carbon and nitrogen, and her lab is dedicated to understanding the impact that elevated nitrogen levels have on forest ecosystem processes, and the way that these ecosystems manage the excess nitrogen. Goodale and her team examine these impacts across multiple spatial and temporal levels, from plots in a watershed to whole continents, utilizing a combination of field studies, ecosystem modeling, and acquired regional data sets to help answer their main research questions. Her past research has taken place mainly in the forests of the Northeastern United States, primarily forests in the White Mountains of New Hampshire and central New York.\n Passage 3:Vassos moved to Boston, Massachusetts in 1919, where he attended the Fenway Art School at night. He studied alongside American artist John Singer Sargent and worked as an assistant for Joseph Urban. In 1924 he moved to New York, where he attended the Art Students League of New York, studying under George Bridgman, John Sloan, and others. He opened his own studio creating window displays for department stores, like Wanamakers, murals, and advertisements for Saks Fifth Avenue, Bonwit Teller, and Packard Motor Cars in his unique black and white illustrated style. At the same time, he illustrated a series of books by Oscar Wilde for E.P. Dutton followed by others including Phobia on which he based his life-long design focus on psychology, his area of expertise as noted by Fortune Magazine's list of top designers in the country. He entered the emergent field of industrial design and was hired by rapidly-growing RCA Victor, under the leadership of David Sarnoff, who discovered Vassos while painting murals at the WCAU skyscraper in Philadelphia. The company had recently acquired Victor Phonograph, built Radio City, and owned NBC Broadcasting, but needed to amplify and modernize their radio manufacturing business. By hiring Vassos, an up-and-coming industrial designer who created their first Styling department, launched Vassos on a four-decade relationship with the company for whom he designed hundreds of items, while also consulting for numerous other clients like Coca-Cola, Waterman, Universal Artists, Remington, and the United States Government. Vassos's work as an interior designer included the Chrysler Building apartment of photographer Margaret Bourke-White, Nedick's Hot Dog stands, displays for RCA in department stores and the World's Fair,and many others for which he employed modular furniture. He eschewed trendy styles like the extreme-streamlined look, popular in the 1930s, and favored the clean, modern look unadorned with unnecessary elements. He expressed his design philosophy for magazines like Pencil Points and in lectures on modern design and art. Although he was hailed as a top designer in the United States during the 1930s, he slipped away from the spotlight of his industrial design peers like Raymond Loewy, Henry Dreyfuss, and Norman Bel Geddes, largely because he did not open a large firm. Unique among the industrial designers of the 20th century, his work was focused on the intersections between interior decorating, furniture design, and the shapes of phonographs, radios and televisions. His contributions include creating a futuristic living room including television, the slide rule dial on radios, emphasis on the haptic experience of media (knobs and buttons), and the \"user experience,\" years before this term was coined.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

In 1787, Amar Singh, the regent of Thanjavur, deposed the minor Raja, his nephew Serfoji II (1787\u201393) and captured the throne. Serfoji II was restored in 1799 with the assistance of the British, who induced him to relinquish the administration of the kingdom and left him in charge of Thanjavur fort and surrounding areas. The kingdom was eventually absorbed into British India in 1855 by the Doctrine of Lapse when Shivaji II (1832\u201355), the last Thanjavur Maratha ruler, died without a legitimate male heir. The British referred to the city as Tanjore in their records. Five years after its annexation, the British replaced Negapatam (modern-day Nagapattinam) with Thanjavur as the seat of the district administration. Under the British, Thanjavur emerged as an important regional centre. The 1871 India census recorded a population of 52,171, making Thanjavur the third largest city in the Madras Presidency. After India's independence, Thanjavur continued as the district headquarters.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Expressionist movies relied heavily on symbolism and artistic imagery rather than stark realism to tell their stories. Given the grim mood in post-WWI, it was not surprising that these films focused heavily on crime and horror. The film usually credited with sparking the popularity of expressionism is Robert Wiene's The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), produced by Erich Pommer. The film tells the story of a demented hypnotist who is using a sleepwalker to perform a series of murders. The film featured a dark and twisted visual style - the set was unrealistic with geometric images painted on the floor and shapes in light and shadow cast on walls, the acting was exaggerated and the costumes bizarre. These stylistic elements became trademarks of this cinematic movement. Other notable works of Expressionism are Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau's Nosferatu (1922), Carl Boese and Paul Wegener's  (1920) and Metropolis (1927) directed by Fritz Lang. The Expressionist movement began to wane during the mid-1920s, but perhaps the fact that its main creators moved to Hollywood, California, allowed this style to remain influential in world cinema for years to come, particularly in American horror films and film noir and in the works of European directors such as Jean Cocteau and Ingmar Bergman.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Thomas went to sea at the age of ten and when he was about twelve he was apprenticed as a merchant seaman on the sloop Friends. He travelled to the West Indies and twice to Newfoundland. In 1819, he became a greenhand on the maiden voyage of the Peterhead whaling ship Hannibal, which hunted bowhead whales around the eastern coast of Greenland, and in its third season sailed into the Davis Strait on the western coast, where ice conditions can be much heavier. In 1829, Abernethy married Barbara Fiddes, the daughter of a ship's carpenter, and they lived at Deptford, southeast London, near the Royal Naval docks.

(Gussow relates the story in his 1998 blues memoir, Mister Satan's Apprentice.) Gussow, a guitarist and harmonica player whose performing experience had previously been limited to a handful of high school and college bands, was galvanized by the encounter. After dropping out of grad school, Gussow spent several years as a part-time street performer in New York and Europe. Gussow's transformation from an academic to a blues player was facilitated by lessons he took from his mentor, New York harmonica virtuoso Nat Riddles, who had performed and recorded with Larry Johnson, Odetta, and others, and by his acculturation into the jam session life at Dan Lynch, a storied East Village juke joint.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:Totonacapan refers to the historical extension where the Totonac people of Mexico dominated, as well as to a region in the modern states of Veracruz and Puebla. The historical territory was much larger than the currently named region, extending from the Cazones River in the north to the Papaloapan River in the south and then west from the Gulf of Mexico into what is now the Sierra Norte de Puebla region and into parts of Hidalgo. When the Spanish arrived, the Totonac ethnicity dominated this large region, although they themselves were dominated by the Aztec Empire. For this reason, they allied with Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s against Tenochtitl\u00e1n. However, over the colonial period, the Totonac population and territory shrank, especially after 1750 when mestizos began infiltrating Totonacapan, taking political and economic power. This continued into the 19th and 20th centuries, prompting the division of most of historical Totonacpan between the states of Puebla and Veracruz. Today, the term refers only to a region in the north of Veracruz were Totonac culture is still important. This region is home to the El Taj\u00edn and Cempoala archeological sites as well as Papantla, which is noted for its performance of the Danza de los Voladores.\n Passage 2:At Final Battle 2009, on December 19, Kevin Steen betrayed and began a feud with his former tag team partner El Generico, turning into a villain in the process. In 2010, Steve Corino joined Steen against Generico and Colt Cabana. At Final Battle 2010, on December 18, Steen lost a match against Generico that resulted in his departure from ROH. Prior to the outcome, on November 4, 2010 at an ROH taping, Kevin Steen's contract agreement with Ring of Honor ended due to financial budget concerns, which ultimately played a role within the stipulation of the match. Corino soon turned face and introduced his ally Jimmy Jacobs, both claiming that they were good people that could reach out to Steen, and asked ROH for a second chance for Steen. However, Steen, who wanted to redeem himself but was opposed by ROH and its security that came to evict him from the building, ended up turning on Corino upon his return at Best in the World 2011 on June 26, sparking a revolt against ROH which fell into conflict with Executive Producer Jim Cornette, who vowed to rid the company of Steen. Furthermore, Steen threatened legal action if he was not reinstated, leading to Steen ultimately defeating Corino on December 21 at Final Battle 2011 to win a contract from ROH. At Showdown in the Sun weekend, on March 30, 2012, Steen defeated El Generico, with help from Jimmy Jacobs in a Last Man Standing match. On May 12 at Border Wars, Steen defeated Davey Richards to win the ROH World Championship for the first time.

At 10\u00a0a.m. the next day, Lewis, was one of 75 local volunteers who left Milford Haven before being split into smaller groups with Lewis and 45 others travelling to Maindy Barracks in Cardiff, the rest joining the Royal Engineers or the Royal Artillery. Two days later, his unit was moved to Lewes as part of the 67th Brigade. He also underwent training at Eastbourne, Hastings, Aldershot and Seaford. On 5 September 1915, just over a year after enlisting, Lewis and his unit sailed to Boulogne, France from Southampton.

Laning, of Buffalo, presided. All but one of the legislators were present, only Assemblyman John M. Roscoe, of Schoharie County, was sick. The caucus nominated Francis Kernan for the U.S. Senate. Kernan had been the Democratic/Liberal Republican candidate for Governor in November 1872 but had been defeated by John Adams Dix. Now Kernan was the choice of Tammany boss John Kelly who had succeeded the corrupt William M. Tweed. Kelly was opposed by John C. Jacobs, who proposed Ex-State Senator Henry C. Murphy, Jacobs's predecessor from the 3rd District, and the Democratic candidate who had lost the U.S. Senate elections in 1867 and 1869 when the Democrats were the minority. Kelly stood firm in his intention to dominate the Democratic Party, and had the caucus nomination made by viva voce vote instead of the more traditional secret ballot.

Passage 1:At the time, the term \"Southern Syria\" referred to a political position which implied support for the Greater Syria nationalism associated with the kingdom promised to the Hashemites of the Hejaz by the British during World War I. After the war, the Hashemite prince Faisal attempted to establish such a Pan-Syrian or pan-Mashriq state (i.e. a united kingdom that would comprise all of modern Syria, as well as Mount Lebanon and Palestine, including Transjordan, so that Palestine would be the province of \"Southern Syria\"). This kingdom was to be united with the other Hashemite domains in Hejaz and Iraq, thus contributing in large measure towards the fulfillment of Pan-Arabist ambitions. However, he was stymied by conflicting promises made by the British to different parties (see Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement, Balfour Declaration and McMahon\u2013Hussein Correspondence), leading to the Franco-Syrian War, which destroyed the Arab Kingdom of Syria in 1920.\n Passage 2:The first NCAA Tournament was organized by the National Association of Basketball Coaches. Oregon won the inaugural tournament, defeating Ohio State 46\u201333 in the first championship game. Before the 1941 tournament, control of the event was given to the NCAA. In the early years of the tournament, it was considered less important than the National Invitation Tournament (NIT), a New York City-based event. Teams were able to compete in both events in the same year, and three of those that did so\u2014Utah in 1944, Kentucky in 1949, and City College of New York (CCNY) in 1950\u2014won the NCAA Tournament. The 1949\u201350 CCNY team won both tournaments (defeating Bradley in both finals), and is the only college basketball team to accomplish this feat. By the mid-1950s, the NCAA Tournament became the more prestigious of the two events, and in 1971 the NCAA barred universities from playing in other tournaments, such as the NIT, if they were invited to the NCAA Tournament. The 2013 championship won by Louisville was the first men's basketball national title to ever be vacated by the NCAA after the school and its coach at the time, Rick Pitino, were implicated in a 2015 sex scandal involving recruits.\n Passage 3:Hispanos identify strongly with their Spanish heritage and most are also mestizos of mixed Apache, Comanche, Pueblo, Navajo, Native Mexican, and Gen\u00edzaro ancestry. Exact numbers for the population size of New Mexican Hispanos is difficult, as many also identify with Chicano and Mexican-American movements. For most of its modern history, New Mexico existed on the periphery of the Spanish empire from 1598 until 1821 and later Mexico (1821\u20131848), but was dominated by Comancheria politically and economically from the 1750s to 1850s. Due to the Comanche, contact with the rest of Spanish America was limited, and New Mexican Spanish developed closer trading links with the Comanche than the rest of New Spain. In the meantime, some Spanish colonists coexisted with and intermarried with Puebloan peoples and Navajos, enemies of the Comanche. New Mexicans of all ethnicities were commonly enslaved by the Comanche and Apache of Apacheria, while Native New Mexicans were commonly enslaved and adopted Spanish language and culture. These Gen\u00edzaros served as house servants, sheep herders, and in other capacities in New Mexico including what is known today as Southern Colorado well into the 1800s. By the late 18th century, Gen\u00edzaros and their descendants, often referred to as Coyotes, comprised nearly one-third of the entire population of New Mexico. After the Mexican\u2013American War, New Mexico and all its inhabitants came under the governance of the English-speaking United States, and for the next hundred years, English-speakers increased in number. By the 1980s, more and more Hispanos were using English instead of New Mexican Spanish at home.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

During his years of service as a minister, his avocation was recording observations of nature and preparing study skins and life mounts of animals of the region. After his retirement from the church in 1940, he organized his collections and observations into the Northern Illinois Museum of Natural History, which he maintained at his home in Baileyville, Ogle County, Illinois. After his death in 1948, most of his life mounts were given to a high school, where they remained until 1983 when they were donated to the Illinois State Museum. Many of his bird study skins, egg sets, and photographs were given to Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Iowa; in 1985-1986 these were transferred to the Illinois State Museum. Among his specimens was a life mount of a (now extinct) passenger pigeon, Ectopistes migratorius (Linnaeus, 1766), collected by his father, Edwin A.

The deal made KSEE a sister station to CBS affiliate KGPE, which Nexstar had just acquired from Newport Television. Normally, duopolies between two \"Big Four\" affiliates, let alone \"Big Three,\" would not be allowed because those stations are usually the four highest-rated stations in a market, which FCC regulations do not allow any common ownership of. However, according to Nielsen, in 2013 KGPE was ranked as the fourth highest-rated station in the market and KSEE fifth, after KFSN (ABC), KFTV (Univision), and KMPH-TV (Fox), allowing a duopoly to be formed between the stations. This marked the second instance (after the Gannett Company purchased ABC affiliate WJXX in Jacksonville, Florida, creating a duopoly with that market's NBC affiliate WTLV, in 2000) in which a single company owns a duopoly involving two stations that are affiliated by a Big Three television network; and is also Nexstar's first true Big Three duopoly (Nexstar's other Big Three duopolies are virtually formed, in which the other station is owned by Mission Broadcasting).

The presence of Bulgarian customs officers at the Carpathians indicates a Bulgarian suzerainty over those lands, though Radu's imperative tone hints at a strong and increasing Wallachian autonomy. Under Radu I and his successor Dan I, the realms in Transylvania and Severin continued to be disputed with Hungary. Basarab was succeeded by Nicholas Alexander, followed by Vladislav I. Vladislav attacked Transylvania after Louis I occupied lands south of the Danube, conceded to recognize him as overlord in 1368, but rebelled again in the same year; his rule also witnessed the first confrontation between Wallachia and the Ottoman Empire (a battle in which Vladislav was allied with Ivan Shishman). After the Magyar conquest (10-11th century), Transylvania had become an autonomous and multi-ethnic voivodeship led by a voivode appointed by the King of Hungary until the 16th century. Several Kings of Hungary invited settlers from Central and Western Europe, such as the Saxons, to come to Transylvania and occupy the region. The Szeklers were brought to southeastern Transylvania as border guards. Romanians are mentioned by the Hungarian documents (township called Olahteluk) in the 13th century (1283) in Bihar County. The \"land of Romanians\" (Terram Blacorum) appeared in Fogaras, and this area was mentioned under the name \"Olachi\" in 1285. After the collapse of the Hungarian Kingdom (following the disastrous Battle of Moh\u00e1cs, 1526) the region became the independent Principality of Transylvania until 1711.\n Passage 2:Brandi Younger better known as Gripsta, is an Oakland, California born female rap artist/actress discovered by Ice-T at the age of 13. She was featured on song titled \"Funky Gripsta\" off of his 1993 album release Home Invasion and later signed to Tuff Break/A&M Records in the 1990s. Her debut single \"Pop Goz the 9\" was partially leaked in January 1994, its music video was directed by Ice-T. However Gripsta's debut single was never officially released. The Tuff Break label on A&M records was dropped before her scheduled release date. She was later featured on The Seventh Deadly Sin, Ice-T's 7th album, Released: October 12, 1999 as well as numerous features on record label Def Jam's The Murda Squad album. She worked with many artists under that association including South Central Cartel, Spice One and Sh'killa. Gripsta was also featured in a principal role in the movie Dangerous Minds in which she played one of the many troubled teens that actress Michelle Pfeiffer sought to reform. Other acting credits include a guest star appearance in the \"Leaving the Life\" episode of the CBS television show Promised Land, a semi popular spin-off of CBS more successful show Touched by an Angel. Gripsta has since changed her name to 'Egypt'.\n Passage 3:Relations between the people of Afghanistan and India traces to the Indus Valley Civilisation. Following Alexander the Great's brief occupation, the successor state of the Seleucid Empire controlled the region known today as Afghanistan. In 305 BCE, they ceded much of it to the Indian Maurya Empire as part of an alliance treaty. The Mauryans brought Buddhism from India and controlled the area south of the Hindu Kush. Their decline began 60 years after Ashoka's rule ended, leading to the Hellenistic reconquest of the region by the Greco-Bactrians. Much of it soon broke away from the Greco-Bactrians and became part of the Indo-Greek Kingdom. The Indo-Greeks had been defeated and expelled by the Indo-Scythians in the late 2nd century BCE. Much of Afghanistan has been influenced by Buddhist, Hindu and Zoroastrian cultures until the arrival of Islam in the 7th century. But despite many Afghans converting to Islam, the Muslims and Hindus lived side by side.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:After education at Canterbury Boys' High School (where he was a contemporary of former Liberal Australian prime minister John Howard), Windschuttle was a journalist on newspapers and magazines in Sydney. He completed a BA (first class honours in history) at the University of Sydney in 1969, and an MA (honours in politics) at Macquarie University in 1978. He enrolled in a PhD but did not submit it; instead he published it under the title The Media with Penguin Books. In 1973, he became a tutor in Australian history at the University of New South Wales (UNSW). Between 1977 and 1981, Windschuttle was lecturer in Australian history and in journalism at the New South Wales Institute of Technology (now the University of Technology, Sydney) before returning to UNSW in 1983 as lecturer/senior lecturer in social policy. He resigned from UNSW in 1993 and since then he has been publisher of Macleay Press and a regular visiting and guest lecturer on history and historiography at American universities.

She began stripping in Canada when she was 14. Two years later she met pornographic actress Erica Boyer and moved to Los Angeles with her. Quinn began performing in adult films at the age of 16 after Boyer introduced her to agent Jim South. Quinn misrepresented her birth year as 1968, which would have made her 22 at the time of her adult film debut. Her first scene was in the film Space Virgins, and it was a five-person group sex scene with two men and two other women, besides Quinn. She won the 1991 AVN Award for Best Group Sex Scene - Video alongside Sunny McKay & Rocco Siffredi for their performance in Buttman's Ultimate Workout. By November 1991 she had appeared in approximately 100 adult films, 60 of which were shot while she was still a minor.\n Passage 3:Charles I is supposed to have created him a baronet 4 May 1645. Of this creation, the first of a physician to that rank, no record exists, but the accurate Le Neve did not doubt the fact, and explained the absence of enrolment. He claimed to have been Physician-General to the army of Charles I. With his friend Walter Charleton, Greaves became travelling physician to Charles II, but settled in London in 1653, and was admitted a fellow of the College of Physicians 18 October 1657. He delivered the Harveian oration at the College of Physicians 25 July 1661 (London, 1667, 4to), of which the original manuscript is in the British Museum (Sloane 302). He says that before Harvey the source of the circulation was as unknown as that of the Nile, and compares England to a heart, whence the knowledge of the circulation was driven forth to other lands. He became physician in ordinary to Charles II, and owned the lands of St Leonard's Forest in Sussex, including that part which became Leonardslee. He married Alicia Nevett (1624\u20131684), widow of Peter Calf (d. 1668).

Passage 1:Melkert was elected as a Member of the House of Representatives after the election of 1986, taking office on 3 June 1986 serving as a frontbencher and spokesperson for Finances. After the election of 1994 Melkert was appointed as Minister of Social Affairs and Employment in the Cabinet Kok I, taking office on 22 August 1994. After the election of 1998 Melkert returned as a Member of the House of Representatives, taking office on 19 May 1998. Following the cabinet formation of 1998 Melkert per his own request asked not to be considered for a cabinet post in the new cabinet, he was seen as a rising star by the Labour Party leadership and was considered as the favorite son to succeed Wim Kok as the next Leader of the Labour Party and was selected as the Parliamentary leader of the Labour Party in the House of Representatives, taking office on 13 July 1998. The Cabinet Kok I was replaced by the Cabinet Kok II on 3 August 1998. In December 2001 the Leader of the Labour Party and incumbent Prime Minister Kok announced he was stepping down as Leader and that he wouldn't stand for the election of 2002, the Labour Party leadership approached Melkert as a candidate to succeed him, Melkert accepted and became the Leader of the Labour Party and Lijsttrekker (top candidate) for the election, taking office on 15 December 2001.

On May 16 2002 Melkert announced he was stepping down as Leader and Parliamentary leader taking responsibility for the defeat but continued to serve in the House of Representatives as a backbencher.\n Passage 2:This led to his role as collaborator over many years with Michael Atiyah, initially via the part played by periodicity in K-theory. Bott made important contributions towards the index theorem, especially in formulating related fixed-point theorems, in particular the so-called 'Woods Hole fixed-point theorem', a combination of the Riemann\u2013Roch theorem and Lefschetz fixed-point theorem (it is named after Woods Hole, Massachusetts, the site of a conference at which collective discussion formulated it). The major Atiyah\u2013Bott papers on what is now the Atiyah\u2013Bott fixed-point theorem were written in the years up to 1968; they collaborated further in recovering in contemporary language Ivan Petrovsky on Petrovsky lacunas of hyperbolic partial differential equations, prompted by Lars G\u00e5rding. In the 1980s, Atiyah and Bott investigated gauge theory, using the Yang\u2013Mills equations on a Riemann surface to obtain topological information about the moduli spaces of stable bundles on Riemann surfaces. In 1983 he spoke to the Canadian Mathematical Society in a talk he called \"A topologist marvels at Physics\".\n Passage 3:Guy Beiner was born and raised in Jerusalem and later moved to kibbutz Glil Yam.

Passage 1:Superblocks are also used when functional units such as rail yards or shipyards, inherited from the 19th and early 20th centuries, are too big to fit in an average city block. A contemporary function which reflects ancient practices that also requires larger than typical blocks is the sports stadium or arena. Just as the Colosseum in ancient Rome, sports complexes require superblocks. The Providence Park stadium in Portland, for example, takes up four normal city blocks as does the equally large Greensboro Coliseum in North Carolina. Other contemporary institutions, establishments or functions that use superblocks are: city halls like Government Center, Boston and Toronto City Hall; regional general hospitals or specialized medical centres; convention and exhibition centers, such as Exhibition Place in Toronto and the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center; and downtown enclosed Shopping Malls such as Eaton Centre in Toronto, echoing the large gallerias of the 19th century. Cultural complexes, such as the Lincoln Center in New York City, often occupy a superblock achieved through the consolidation of regular city blocks. A recent superblock user is the merchandise distribution centre, which can range in area from one to ten city blocks.\n Passage 2:Rudd was probably born in North Yorkshire 1794 or 1795. He studied at St John's College, Cambridge where he got a B.A. before 1818 and a M.A. before 1821. He was ordained as deacon in 1818 and as priest in 1819 by John Fisher.

The Triangle Diner, a 1948 stainless steel O'Mahony original model, is located in the old town of Winchester, Virginia, and is being historically restored to how it appeared in 1948. The Triangle Diner is the oldest stainless steel style O'Mahony diner in Virginia. In 2007 Tommy's Deluxe Diner was moved from Middletown, Rhode Island, to Oakley, Utah, where it opened as the Road Island Diner. One of the original ones displayed at the 1939 New York World's Fair, made by Paramount Diners, is still in operation as the White Mana in Jersey City. Also in Jersey City is the Miss America, a 1942 classic stainless steel model, located next to the New Jersey City University campus. The Shawmut Diner of New Bedford, Massachusetts was donated by its owners to the Bristol County House of Corrections in Dartmouth, Massachusetts and will serve as a training facility for inmates.

A Republican lawyer from New England, born in Vermont, Coolidge worked his way up the ladder of Massachusetts state politics, eventually becoming governor of Massachusetts. His response to the Boston Police Strike of 1919 thrust him into the national spotlight and gave him a reputation as a man of decisive action. The next year, he was elected vice president of the United States, and he succeeded to the presidency upon the sudden death of Warren G. Harding in 1923. Elected in his own right in 1924, he gained a reputation as a small government conservative and also as a man who said very little and had a rather dry sense of humor.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

He also purchased many of the cinnamon estates that were previously owned by the Dutch administration in Moratuwa, Ratmalana, Dambuwa and Katunayake, citronella plantations in Ahangama and coconut plantatins throughout the island. His land holdings in Colombo consisted of several estates that stretched between Galle Face and Panadura. The De Soysa and Peiris family established the first Ceylonese-owned bank, the Bank of Kandy at Dalada weediya and Pettah, Colombo in 1839 & 1860, becoming the largest native commercial enterprise of the era at a time when European owned banks were reluctant to extend credit to the Ceylonese and the high interest rates of the Nattukkottai Chettiars.

In Yoga psychology, it refers to the function of the mind in its intelligent (s\u0101ttvika) aspect by which the sensations (due to the sense-object contact \u0101lochana) are associated, differentiated, integrated, and assimilated into precepts and concepts; it refers to the creative faculty of the mind, and also accepted by Dign\u0101ga and Dharmakirti of the Yogacara and the Sautr\u0101ntika schools of Buddhism respectively. The former held the view that the nature of a reality is absolute consciousness devoid of any subject-object relations that are the constructs of the mind and expressed in language. However, the Ny\u0101ya realists did not accept Dign\u0101ga\u2019s contention that the cognitive state is self-conscious or self-luminous awareness and its expression in propositional form is a mental construction, because they held that there are two stages of perception \u2013 indeterminate or nirvikalpa perception and the determinate or savikalpa perception, follows the second stage, is when the mind relates it to the second stage.

Emerita Augusta was one of the ends of the V\u00eda de la Plata (Silver Way), a strategic Roman Route between the gold mines around Asturica Augusta and the most important Roman city in the Iberian Peninsula. The city became the capital of Lusitania province, and one of the most important cities in the Roman Empire. M\u00e9rida preserves more important ancient Roman monuments than any other city in Spain, including a triumphal arch and a theatre.\n Passage 2:In addition to Shahrbanu, the historian Al-Masudi provides the names of four other children of Yazdegerd III; two sons, namely Peroz and Bahram, and two daughters, Adrag and Mardawand. While it was historically recorded that her brothers had escaped to the Tang emperor of China, Islamic traditions state that Shahrbanu's sisters were captured alongside her. One allegedly married Abdullah, son of the Caliph Umar, and became the mother of his son Salim, while another married Muhammad, son of the Caliph Abu Bakr, and became the mother of his son Qasim. Further alleged siblings have also been attributed to Shahrbanu, including Ghayanbanu, who was her full sister, Izdundad, who married the Jewish exilarch Bostanai, and Mihrbanu, who married Chandragupta, the Indian king of Ujjain.\n Passage 3:The regiment embarked for the West Indies in October 1826. It was initially based in Trinidad but moved to Barbados in January 1828, Antigua in January 1830 and Demerara and Berbice in February 1833. It embarked for home in March 1837. It returned to India in 1842 and saw action in Central India during the Indian Rebellion. It formed part of the force led by Major-General Sir Hugh Rose which besieged and captured Jhansi Fort in April 1858: four Victoria Crosses were awarded to members of the regiment for this operation. It returned home in August 1859 and was deployed to Gibraltar in 1864 and then went on to Mauritius in 1867 before returning to the Cape of Good Hope in 1870. It returned home in 1875 and then embarked for Bermuda in 1880.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:On 4 May 1918, in the aftermath of the Finnish Civil War, Silatch arrived secretly in Kotka, Finland, to evacuate remaining members of the Finnish Red Guard. However, she was confiscated by the Finns and joined the Finnish icebreaker fleet as Ilmarinen, after the legendary hero from Kalevala. In December 1919 she was sent to Koivisto to assist three Finnish torpedo boats, C1, C2 and C3 that had been surrounded by ice some thick. The 150-ton torpedo boats had participated in the British campaign in the Baltic, and Admiral Walter Cowan had demanded that the Finnish squadron patrolling the area had to stay until the British forces had withdrawn. Despite the efforts of Ilmarinen, the weak-hulled torpedo boats were crushed by the ice, and the newly founded Finnish Navy lost one fifth of its ships. After the winter of 1919 Ilmarinen was laid up until she was returned to the Soviet Union according to the Treaty of Tartu. In turn the Soviets gave back the Finnish icebreaker Avance. The name Ilmarinen was later given to a Finnish coastal defence ship launched in 1931.\n Passage 2:The present-day Angels franchise began play as the Los Angeles Angels in . Owned by actor Gene Autry and his wife Jackie, they played their inaugural season at Wrigley Field in South Los Angeles (not to be confused with the Chicago stadium of the same name). They moved to Dodger Stadium the following season, becoming tenants of the National League's Los Angeles Dodgers for four seasons. During the season, Gene Autry struck a deal with the suburban city of Anaheim on a new stadium for the Angels. The team changed its name to California Angels late in the season, as they were the only American League team in the state at the time, and moved to the city-owned Anaheim Stadium in . They would play under this moniker for over 30 seasons.\n Passage 3:After going 6\u20136 in 2006, the Wildcats lost three of their first four games in 2007, including a 29\u201327 loss at home to New Mexico. In that game, Stoops gained a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for his behavior on the sideline, which led to a New Mexico touchdown. Following a 2007, 21\u201320 home loss to Stanford, dropping the team to 2\u20136, local media began speculating as to whether Stoops would be fired. However, subsequent statements by the athletic director and the university's president indicated that Stoops would return for an additional season. At the beginning of the season, many believed this to be the year Stoops and the Wildcats would reach their first college bowl game in a decade; a winning season was considered a must in order for Stoops to remain as Wildcats head coach. Under the direction of Stoops, Arizona scored 70 points in the season opener against the Idaho Vandals, falling just four points short of a school record for points scored in a game. They went on to soundly defeat Toledo, UCLA, Washington, and California, but lost close games to New Mexico and Stanford. They went on to defeat Washington State on the road to secure bowl eligibility at six wins, but lost to Oregon on the road after mounting a dramatic second-half come-from-behind rally, and to Oregon State in Tucson on a last-second field goal. The Wildcats' final game of the regular season was a 31\u201310 victory on December 6 in Tucson against Arizona State in the annual Territorial Cup rivalry game. With that win and a final regular season record of 7\u20135, Arizona accepted a bid from to the Las Vegas Bowl to face BYU. It was the Wildcats' first bowl appearance since the 1998 Holiday Bowl. Stoops' reputation in Tucson was mixed; while the Wildcats had a winning record and appeared in and won their first bowl game in ten years, many fans were divided during the season on whether he should be retained as head coach, as they expected Stoops to guide the team to an eight, nine or even ten-win season given the talent level and the offensive and defensive systems employed by the Wildcats (and with the overall talent level in the Pac-10 conference perceived to be not as strong as usual in 2008). While Stoops brought the Wildcat football program to a level of respectability which was lost during the era of John Mackovic, some fans were disappointed the program was not at the elite level of Stoops' former program Oklahoma or of perennial Pac-10 football power USC. However, Stoops was given strong votes of confidence by UA (later UNLV) athletic director Jim Livengood, by university president Dr. Robert Shelton, and by several prominent Arizona football boosters.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

In 1922, he emigrated to Berlin with the intention of becoming an architect. He gave up this plan and began studying theatre in 1923, first under Emmanuel Reicher, and then, from 1925 to 1926, as a theatre studies student under Max Herrmann at the university. He worked with Leopold Jessner and J\u00fcrgen Fehling, served as a chorus member under Erwin Piscator, and was a director's assistant to Fritz Lang on the production of Metropolis. During this time, Dudow also ran a bookstore with his wife and worked as a foreign correspondent for a Bulgarian newspaper. In 1929, he visited the Soviet Union, where he met Vladimir Mayakovsky and Sergei Eisenstein in Moscow and eventually, Bertolt Brecht. After his return from the USSR, Dudow directed Brecht's theatrical piece, The Decision (Die Massnahme), and began his film directing career. He was commissioned by the left-wing, Soviet-German production company Prometheus-Film to direct a short film, Wie der Berliner Arbeiter wohnt (1929), as part of the documentary series Wie lebt der Berliner Arbeiter? Dudow's first feature, Kuhle Wampe (To Whom Does the World Belong?, 1932) was a collaboration with Brecht (who provided the script and helped finance the project), Hanns Eisler, and Ernst Ottwalt. It was banned because it was perceived as being politically subversive. \n Passage 2:Boulding maintained his links with football and trained with Doncaster Rovers, and in 1998 he joined non-league Hallam near his home in Sheffield. His form at Hallam attracted the interest of a number of league clubs, and Boulding was offered a trial by Mansfield Town. He was given a contract by the Division Three side and turned professional in 1999, which brought an end to his tennis career. He made his debut with Mansfield in a League Cup game against Nottingham Forest on 11 August 1999 as a late substitute for Gary Tallon, before his first league game came three days later against Cheltenham Town. He had to wait until his 12th game as a professional to register his first goal when he scored in a 2\u20131 victory over Shrewsbury Town on 23 October. He eventually finished his first season with six goals with Mansfield coming 17th but 17\u00a0points above Carlisle United, the only side to be relegated out of The Football League.\n Passage 3:Jones was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the first round (24th overall) of the 1992 NFL Draft, becoming the first player from East Carolina University to be drafted that high. The team moved Ken Norton Jr. to outside linebacker, allowing him to become the second rookie (Eugene Lockhart) in Cowboys history to start at middle linebacker, and the second rookie (Lee Roy Jordan) linebacker in franchise history to start in a season-opener. He helped the Cowboys establish the top defense in the league in 1992, was named NFC rookie of the year and was selected to the NFL All-rookie team. He started 13 out of 15 games, posting 108 tackles (second on the team), one sack, 2 tackles for loss, 4 quarterback pressures, one pass defensed and one fumble recovery.

Passage 1:The Derg overthrew the Ethiopian Empire and Emperor Haile Selassie in a coup d'\u00e9tat on 12 September 1974, establishing Ethiopia as a Marxist-Leninist communist state with itself as a military junta and provisional government. Various left-wing, ethnic, and anti-communist opposition groups supported by the United States began armed resistance to the Soviet-backed Derg, in addition to the Eritrean separatists already fighting in the Eritrean War of Independence. The Derg used military campaigns and the Qey Shibir (Ethiopian Red Terror) to repress the rebels. By the mid-1980s, various issues such as the 1983\u20131985 famine, economic decline and other after-effects of Derg policies ravaged Ethiopia, increasing popular support for the rebels. The Derg dissolved itself in 1987, establishing the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (PDRE) under the Workers' Party of Ethiopia (WEP) in an attempt to maintain its rule. The Soviet Union ended its support for the PDRE in the late-1980s and the government was overwhelmed by the increasingly victorious rebel groups. In May 1991, the PDRE was defeated in Eritrea and President Mengistu Haile Mariam fled the country. The Ethiopian Civil War ended on 4 June 1991 when the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), a coalition of left-wing ethnic rebel groups, entered the capital Addis Ababa and overthrew the WEP. The PDRE was dissolved and replaced with the Tigray People's Liberation Front-led Transitional Government of Ethiopia.\n Passage 2:Gillan went on to portray Amy Pond, companion to the Eleventh Doctor (portrayed by Matt Smith), on the British sci-fi series Doctor Who. Before cast in the lead role in May 2009, she previously appeared on Doctor Who in Series 4 episode \"The Fires of Pompeii\" in the role of a soothsayer. She made her first on-screen appearance as Amy in \"The Eleventh Hour\" with her cousin Caitlin Blackwood portraying a younger version of the same character.

An informal affiliate to the San Francisco Zen Center (SFZC), BZC was founded in 1967 by Weitsman and Shunryu Suzuki as a satellite group for the SFZC. Despite founding the center, Weitsman was not installed as abbot there until 1985, one year after receiving Dharma transmission from Hoitsu Suzuki. Weitsman's Dharma heir, Alan Senauke, lives on site with his wife Laurie Senauke (as of 1999) and also works for the Buddhist Peace Fellowship.

In this capacity, he persuaded Raphael, the abbot of Pannonhalma to borrow 40 silver denari to the king, who planned to visit Henry II, Duke of Austria with his court and a large number of escorts. Raphael had to sell a church estate in order to obtain sum.

In fear of being seized and executed by King G\u00e9za II, his brother, the rebellious Duke Stephen sought refuge in the Holy Roman Empire in the summer of 1157. Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor, was willing to arbitrate the conflict between G\u00e9za II and Stephen, and dispatched his envoys to Hungary. In response, G\u00e9za sent delegates to the Emperor, Judge royal H\u00e9der and Gervasius, Bishop of Gy\u0151r. At the Diet of Regensburg in January 1158, H\u00e9der and Gervasius rejected the accusations of Stephen and successfully reached the Emperor withdrew his support from the pretender. After that Stephen left for Constantinople.\n Passage 2:Sprigg joined the FRC in 2001, and his research and writing have addressed issues of marriage and family, human sexuality, and religion in public life, and opposition to same-sex marriage and gay rights. He has testified before federal, state and local courts on these issues. He has argued that gay marriage is not an issue of civil rights. He has linked homosexuality to pedophilia, and argued that homosexuals are trying to brainwash children into accepting homosexuality through public schools. Sprigg has publicly suggested that repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell would encourage molestation of heterosexual members of the military and suggested Kevin Jennings may have engaged in statutory rape. In February 2010, Sprigg stated on NBC's Hardball that Lawrence v.

At CWRU, he conducted research with Dr. Robert D. Goldman and showed that microfilaments in mammalian cells were actin filaments through the binding of purified heavy meromyosin to decorate the microfilaments in permeabilized cells. He continued his studies in cell biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, earning his Ph.D. in 1976; his thesis research focused on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) under the supervision of Dr. David Baltimore and Dr. Harvey Lodish. Knipe first separated and translated the VSV mRNAs in vitro to identify their coding potential. He then showed that the VSV glycoprotein (G) and membrane (M) proteins are assembled into virions by two separate pathways. The pathway for G protein helped defined the secretory pathway for membrane glycoprotein assembly and the pathway for the M protein defined a cytosolic pathway for membrane protein assembly.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

She was featured on song titled \"Funky Gripsta\" off of his 1993 album release Home Invasion and later signed to Tuff Break/A&M Records in the 1990s. Her debut single \"Pop Goz the 9\" was partially leaked in January 1994, its music video was directed by Ice-T. However Gripsta's debut single was never officially released. The Tuff Break label on A&M records was dropped before her scheduled release date. She was later featured on The Seventh Deadly Sin, Ice-T's 7th album, Released: October 12, 1999 as well as numerous features on record label Def Jam's The Murda Squad album.

Following Alexander the Great's brief occupation, the successor state of the Seleucid Empire controlled the region known today as Afghanistan. In 305 BCE, they ceded much of it to the Indian Maurya Empire as part of an alliance treaty. The Mauryans brought Buddhism from India and controlled the area south of the Hindu Kush. Their decline began 60 years after Ashoka's rule ended, leading to the Hellenistic reconquest of the region by the Greco-Bactrians. Much of it soon broke away from the Greco-Bactrians and became part of the Indo-Greek Kingdom. The Indo-Greeks had been defeated and expelled by the Indo-Scythians in the late 2nd century BCE. Much of Afghanistan has been influenced by Buddhist, Hindu and Zoroastrian cultures until the arrival of Islam in the 7th century. But despite many Afghans converting to Islam, the Muslims and Hindus lived side by side.\n Passage 3:There is evidence that the Second Bulgarian Empire ruled at least nominally the Wallachian lands up to the Ruc\u0103r\u2013Bran corridor as late as the late 14th century. In a charter by Radu I, the Wallachian voivode requests that tsar Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria order his customs officers at Ruc\u0103r and the D\u00e2mbovi\u0163a River bridge to collect tax following the law. The presence of Bulgarian customs officers at the Carpathians indicates a Bulgarian suzerainty over those lands, though Radu's imperative tone hints at a strong and increasing Wallachian autonomy. Under Radu I and his successor Dan I, the realms in Transylvania and Severin continued to be disputed with Hungary. Basarab was succeeded by Nicholas Alexander, followed by Vladislav I. Vladislav attacked Transylvania after Louis I occupied lands south of the Danube, conceded to recognize him as overlord in 1368, but rebelled again in the same year; his rule also witnessed the first confrontation between Wallachia and the Ottoman Empire (a battle in which Vladislav was allied with Ivan Shishman). After the Magyar conquest (10-11th century), Transylvania had become an autonomous and multi-ethnic voivodeship led by a voivode appointed by the King of Hungary until the 16th century. Several Kings of Hungary invited settlers from Central and Western Europe, such as the Saxons, to come to Transylvania and occupy the region. The Szeklers were brought to southeastern Transylvania as border guards. Romanians are mentioned by the Hungarian documents (township called Olahteluk) in the 13th century (1283) in Bihar County. The \"land of Romanians\" (Terram Blacorum) appeared in Fogaras, and this area was mentioned under the name \"Olachi\" in 1285. After the collapse of the Hungarian Kingdom (following the disastrous Battle of Moh\u00e1cs, 1526) the region became the independent Principality of Transylvania until 1711.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

FitzGerald purported that he is the grandson of Major Lord Desmond FitzGerald (1888-1916), the second son of The 5th Duke of Leinster, who was recorded as having been killed in action during the First World War while serving with the Irish Guards. When The 6th Duke of Leinster died, mad and childless, in February 1922, the Leinster dukedom \u2013 and its considerable wealth and lands \u2013 devolved upon his youngest brother Lord Edward FitzGerald, who succeeded as The 7th Duke of Leinster. Paul FitzGerald and his supporters claimed that Lord Desmond faked his death and emigrated to California (by way of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada) where he lived until his death in 1967. It was further claimed by Mrs Caudill that a package of documents, witnessed by the Prince of Wales and Sir Edgar Vincent, Lord Feversham, had been lodged by her father with the Crown Office of the House of Lords in 1929, and the family had been denied access to them. Mrs Caudill believed the documents included evidence that her father agreed to relinquish the title for one generation but made it clear it was to be passed down to his son, her brother Leonard FitzGerald. Instead, it was passed down through her father's brother's family. It was alleged that an archivist had acknowledged the package had once existed, but the official line was that it was now lost.\n Passage 2:The Bighorn River begins as the Wind River in the Rocky Mountains at Wind River Lake, near Two Ocean Mountain and the summit of Togwotee Pass. The Wind River flows southeast receiving the east fork of the Wind River from the north, and enters the Wind River Basin, flowing past Dubois and Johnstown, to Riverton, where it receives the Little Wind River. The river then changes direction to the northeast and then the north, flowing into Boysen Reservoir, which is formed by Boysen Dam. Below the dam it enters the Wind River Canyon, where the river narrows and forms many rapids. At the end of the canyon the Wind River widens out in an area called the Wedding of the Waters where it becomes the Bighorn River and enters the Bighorn Basin. The Bighorn continues northward, passing through Thermopolis, Worland, and Basin. At Greybull it receives the Greybull River, and about north of that confluence it enters Bighorn Lake, where it is joined by the Shoshone River. North of the confluence with the Shoshone, the reservoir narrows as the river enters the Bighorn Canyon, where it crosses into Montana. At the end of the canyon, the river passes through Yellowtail Dam and Afterbay Dam. The river turns to the northeast and enters the Great Plains. At Hardin the river is joined by the Little Bighorn River. Approximately downriver from the Little Bighorn, in Big Horn County, the Bighorn empties into the Yellowstone.\n Passage 3:President \u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n and his successor Calles, as well as other politicians, wanted the revolutionary government to restrict and terminate the Catholic Church in Mexico. In February 1925, armed intruders calling themselves \"Knights of the Order of Guadeloupe\" occupied the church of Mar\u00eda de la Soledad in Mexico City where , a Freemason and former Catholic priest, proclaimed himself the future patriarch of a new national church; parishioners attacked the interlopers and rioted the next day; similar riots were incited when other churches in Mexico were occupied by armed intruders that month. These armed intruders occupying churches induced fear of anti-Catholic persecution that led to the formation of the National League for the Defense of Religious Liberty (LNDLR) a militant Catholic defense organization. Official favoritism of a national church enraged revolutionaries who saw this as a \"violation of state '\" with potential to faction the revolution, so Calles stopped his support of after about 3 months. Nevertheless, the government failed in 1925 to orchestrate P\u00e9rez's consecration by a visiting Eastern Orthodox bishop, but in 1926, North American Old Roman Catholic Church Bishop Carmel Henry Carfora consecrated P\u00e9rez, Antonio Benicio L\u00f3pez Sierra, and Macario L\u00f3pez Valdez as bishops. In 1927, L\u00f3pez Sierra established an church in San Antonio, Texas, where Archbishop Arthur Jerome Drossaerts, of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Antonio, called the ' (Spanish for schismatics) \"designing proselytizers of the sects supported by Calles and the Mexican government, that archenemy of all Christianity;\" and in 1929, L\u00f3pez Valdes established an church in Los Angeles, California. P\u00e9rez moved his cathedra to San Antonio in March 1930 but in April 1931, P\u00e9rez returned to Mexico City.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:Chibnall suggested including a \"bonkers\" gang of characters picked from around time and space. He felt that Doctor Who could have \"collisions of characters that no other show in the world can do\", and that it was about finding a \"disparate\" group of characters who would \"bounce\" off each other. Nefertiti's decision not to return to her own time fits in with the historical record, as the date and cause of her death are unknown. Chibnall asked to introduce Rory's father, as Amy and Rory would be leaving in four episodes and Rory's family life had not been explored yet. Mark Williams who played Rory's father previously appeared in the Fifth Doctor audio adventure The Eternal Summer. Rupert Graves, who played an Edwardian hunter in this episode, previously worked with Moffat on the BBC series Sherlock. David Bradley's character, Solomon, was modelled on a \"well-known nightclub owner with long hair\". Chibnall described him as \"half businessman, half Somali pirate\". Bradley and Williams had previously worked together on the Harry Potter film franchise. Bradley was later cast as the First Doctor William Hartnell for the 50th anniversary documentary drama An Adventure in Space and Time. Comedy duo Mitchell and Webb provided the voices of Solomon's two robots; executive producer Caroline Skinner called the casting choice \"perfect\". Richard Hope, who played the Silurian Bleytal, previously appeared as Malohkeh in the episodes \"The Hungry Earth\", \"Cold Blood\" and \"The Wedding of River Song\".\n Passage 2:Arthur Aloysius O'Leary was born on September 27, 1887, in Washington, D.C. His father was a worker on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. He was educated at Gonzaga College, and his parish was the adjacent St. Aloysius Church. He entered the Society of Jesus on August 14, 1903, and was sent to St. Andrew-on-Hudson in New York for his scholasticate. He then completed his studies at Woodstock College in Maryland, where he earned a Doctor of Philosophy. He went to Georgetown University in 1912, as a professor of philosophy, holding the position until 1916. At the same time, he was also spiritual director for the university. He was finally ordained a priest in 1919, becoming a member of the first class of priests ordained at Georgetown. He then returned to St. Andrew-on-Hudson, where he taught for several years.\n Passage 3:Vicelinus was called to Bremen to act as teacher and principal of the school, and was offered a canonry by Archbishop Frederick of the Archbishopric of Hamburg-Bremen. In 1122 he may have gone to Laon to complete his studies under Abelard. In 1126, Vicelinus decided to travel to Madgeburg, in order to see St. Norbert, who at that time was the archbishop. He hoped that St. Norbert would ordain him a priest and he could begin missionary work among the Slavs. For one reason or another this plan failed and so Vicelinus returned to Bremen, where Bishop Albero ordained him. Hamburg-Bremen's Archbishop Adalbero sent him among the Polabian Slavs, and in the fall of 1126 Henry, Prince of the Obotrites, gave him a church in Liubice, near the site of the later L\u00fcbeck. At the death of Henry (22 March 1127) Vicelinus returned to Bremen, and was appointed pastor at Wippenthorp. This gave him an opportunity to work among the Wagrians and neighbouring Obotrites.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:Geoffrey Alan Millar (born 22 November 1955) is a former Australian cricketer who played several matches for Western Australia during the early 1980s. From Perth, Millar played at colts level during the late 1970s, generally as an all-rounder. He made his Sheffield Shield debut for Western Australia during the 1981\u201382 competition, and failed to take a wicket in what was to be his only first-class match. In the match, against Queensland at the WACA Ground in February 1982, he was part of a pace attack that included David Boyd (who he opened the bowling with in the first innings), Mick Malone, and Ken MacLeay. Millar also appeared at List A level several times for Western Australia. In his first match, the third-place playoff of the 1981\u201382 McDonald's Cup, he took 2/17 and scored 30 runs, and was thus named man of the match. His two further matches both occurred in the following year's tournament. At grade cricket level, Millar played 177 matches for the Mount Lawley District Cricket Club.\n Passage 2:Haskell invented a formula for a waterproof glue in 1913. The glue was made from blood-album. From this glue he made a material of \"plies\" of crossed grain layers of wood, that is known today as plywood. Haskell named this composite material after himself with the brand name Haskelite. He worked out the mechanics of being able to mold and shape this plywood into three dimensions. From this plywood he made a canoe that was molded from one piece of plywood. The canoe plywood was shaped by hydraulic presses as an innovation devised by Haskell. The unusually designed canoe of no skeleton framework or ribs was given the brand name Arex (\"king of the water\") and made out of the Haskell Manufacturing Company building on N. Rowe Street in Ludington, Michigan. It later became better known just as the Haskell canoe. Haskell formed the Haskell Manufacturing Company in 1916 to make boats and canoes. He incorporated it with $100,000 in 1917. The Haskell Boat Company made 600 Haskell canoes in the first year.\n Passage 3:He was born in Breslau, Prussia (now the Polish city of Wroc\u0142aw), into a wealthy Polish-Jewish family whose parents had come to Breslau from Pilica, near Zawiercie, in 1854. He was an ardent Jew at a time when many Jews downplayed their Jewishness. He showed early talent from a very tender age, beginning his musical training at home until 1865, when his family moved to Dresden. There he continued his piano studies at the conservatory. He moved to Berlin in 1869 to continue his studies first at the Julius Stern's Conservatory, where he studied piano with Eduard Franck and composition with Friedrich Kiel, and then at Theodor Kullak's Neue Akademie der Tonkunst, where he studied composition with Richard W\u00fcerst and orchestration with Heinrich Dorn. There he became close friends with the Scharwenka brothers, Xaver and Philipp. In 1871 he accepted Kullak's offer to become a teacher in his academy; as he was also a more than competent violinist, he sometimes played first violin in the orchestra.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:Sabita Devi (1914\u20131965) was a Hindi film actress in Indian cinema. She is stated to be one of the \"prominent\" leading ladies of the \"pioneering era\" of Indian cinema along with Mehtab, Bibbo, Durga Khote, Gohar, Devika Rani and Seeta Devi. A Jewess by birth, she changed her name to find acceptability in Hindi cinema like the other Anglo-Indian and Jewish actresses of her time, Sulochana (Ruby Myers), Seeta Devi (Renee Smith), Madhuri (Beryl Claessen), and Manorama (Erin Daniels). After initially working with British Dominion Films Ltd., Calcutta, she shifted to Bombay and performed mainly in films produced by Sagar Movietone with her co-star in most films being Motilal. Some of the popular films with Motilal were Dr. Madhurika (1935) and Kulvadhu (1937) directed by Sarvottam Badami. Their first film together was Shaher Ka Jadoo (1934), which was also Motilal's debut film, and then Lagna Bandhan (1936) both directed by Kaliprasad Ghosh. She acted in Silver King (1935) with Motilal. It was an action film directed by C. M. Luhar, which became a \"huge success\".\n Passage 2:Promoted lieutenant-colonel in 1852, and colonel (and commanding officer of the 5th Uhlans) in 1853, Manteuffel was sent on important diplomatic missions to Vienna and St Petersburg. In 1857 he was promoted to major-general and chief of the Prussian Military Cabinet (the King's military advisers). He gave strong support to the Prince Regent's plans for the reorganization of the army. In 1861 he was violently attacked in a pamphlet by Karl Twesten (1820\u20131870), a Liberal leader, whom he had wounded in a duel, for which Manteuffel insisted on being briefly imprisoned. He was promoted to lieutenant-general for the coronation of William I on 18 October 1861 and saw active service in that rank in the Danish War of 1864, then at its conclusion was appointed civil and military governor of Schleswig. In the Austrian War of 1866 he first occupied Holstein and afterwards commanded a division under Vogel von Falkenstein in the Hanoverian campaign, then in July succeeded Vogel in command of the Army of the Main.\n Passage 3:Page attended the Okemos Montessori School (now called Montessori Radmoor) in Okemos, Michigan, from 1975 to 1979, and graduated from East Lansing High School in 1991. He attended Interlochen Center for the Arts as a saxophonist for two summers while in high school. Page holds a Bachelor of Science in computer engineering from the University of Michigan, with honors and a Master of Science in computer science from Stanford University. While at the University of Michigan, Page created an inkjet printer made of Lego bricks (literally a line plotter), after he thought it possible to print large posters cheaply with the use of inkjet cartridges\u2014Page reverse-engineered the ink cartridge, and built all of the electronics and mechanics to drive it. Page served as the president of the Beta Epsilon chapter of the Eta Kappa Nu fraternity, and was a member of the 1993 \"Maize & Blue\" University of Michigan Solar Car team. As an undergraduate at the University of Michigan, he proposed that the school replace its bus system with a personal rapid transit system, which is essentially a driverless monorail with separate cars for every passenger.

Passage 1:Adams was active in rioting at this time and later became involved in the republican movement. In August 1971, internment was reintroduced to Northern Ireland under the Special Powers Act 1922. Adams was interned in March 1972, on , but on the Provisional IRA's insistence was released in June to take part in secret, but abortive talks in London. The IRA negotiated a short-lived truce with the British government and an IRA delegation met with British Home Secretary William Whitelaw at Cheyne Walk in Chelsea. The delegation included Adams, Martin McGuinness, Sean Mac Stiofain (IRA Chief of Staff), Daithi O'Conaill, Seamus Twomey, Ivor Bell and Dublin solicitor Myles Shevlin. Adams was re-arrested in July 1973 and interned at the Long Kesh internment camp. After taking part in an IRA-organised escape attempt, he was sentenced to a period of imprisonment. During this time, he wrote articles in the paper An Phoblacht under the by-line \"Brownie\", where he criticised the strategy and policy of Sinn F\u00e9in president Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh and IRA Belfast OC Billy McKee. He was also highly critical of a decision taken by McKee to assassinate members of the rival Official IRA, who had been on ceasefire since 1972. \n Passage 2:When Bundgaard arrived in Copenhagen, he undertook a variety of odd jobs until his artistic talents were discovered by Emil Blichfeldt who encouraged him to attend the Technical School in 1884 and later the Danish Academy. It was there that he was introduced to French Naturalism by Stephan Sinding, giving his works with a rather dramatic touch. A stay in Paris also provided him with inspiration from Jules Dalou, Alexandre Falgui\u00e8re and Auguste Rodin. In addition, his father's interest in mythology and folk tales reinforced his imaginative approach which can be seen in his robust, Naturalistic works, often made of granite. His interest in ecclesiastical art from the Middle Ages is also apparent. Bundgaard undertook several major decorative projects including sculptures for the recently built Copenhagen City Hall (1894\u201399) and for Christiansborg Palace (1907\u201328) where his four majestic figures stand over the entrance to the parliamentary chamber. Bundgaard's works often exhibit a mythological, nationalistic slant as can be seen in two of his masterpieces, the Gefion Fountain (1908) on Copenhagen's waterfront and the Cimbrian Bull (1937) in Aalborg. He also completed a number of monuments in commemoration of the volunteers from 1848 and 1864 as well as the Reunification Monument in Randers. Many of Bundgaard's original plaster models can be seen in the Thingb\u00e6k Kalkminer Museum, a former mine near the Rebild National Park.\n Passage 3:Diana Beck was born in 1900 in Hoole, Chester, to James Beck, a tailor, and Margaret Helena Kinloch. She attended The Queen's School before studying medicine at the London School of Medicine for Women, where she won two prizes and a scholarship. After graduating in 1925, she worked at the Royal Free Hospital as a house surgeon and then a surgical registrar throughout the 1930s. She chose to specialise in neurosurgery and trained under Hugh Cairns at the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford, where she also acted as a general surgeon providing treatment to injured soldiers during the war. In 1939, she was awarded the William Gibson Research Scholarship for Medical Women by the Royal Society of Medicine, and used the grant to undertake research in Oxford with Dorothy Stuart Russell.

Now facing a 17-0 deficit, the Bills offense self-destructed on their next drive. Facing 3rd and 8, Jim Kelly was sacked by linebacker Kevin Green and fumbled the ball. Center Kent Hull recovered the fumble for Buffalo, but it didn't help much. On the next play, Lee Flowers stormed into the backfield and tackled punter Chris Mohr on the Bills 12-yard line, leading to another Johnson field goal that gave Pittsburgh a 20-0 lead. Buffalo responded with a drive to the Steelers 30-yard line, only to lose the ball when Lake forced a fumble from Thurman Thomas that was recovered by defensive back Chris Oldham. However, the Bills soon got the ball back with excellent field position after Rohn Stark punted the ball 33 yards to the Steelers 49. Kelly then got the team to the 1-yard line with three completions, hitting Tony Cline for 17 yards, Andre Reed for 5, and Steve Tasker for 26. Thomas then ran the ball into the end zone, cutting the score to 20-7. Only 45 seconds remained in the half, but O'Donnell proved up to the challenge of earning his team some more points, completing 4 consecutive passes for 53 yards to get the team to the Bills 16-yard line. Johnson finished the drive with his third field goal, giving the Steelers a 23-7 halftime lead.\n Passage 2:Surtees was formed by John Surtees after he left BRM to start his own team. He bought a McLaren M7C so that he could use it until the TS7 was ready. The car made its debut at the 1970 British Grand Prix with Surtees driving. He qualified 19th and retired with an oil pressure failure. In Germany, Surtees qualified 15th and was classified in ninth, although his race ended in an engine failure. The Austrian Grand Prix saw Surtees qualify 12th and retire when his engine blew. In Italy, the Englishman qualified 10th and retired when an electrical failure stalled the car at the start. The Canadian Grand Prix saw Surtees qualify and finish fifth. The team owner was joined by Derek Bell as a driver for the United States Grand Prix. Surtees qualified eighth and Bell 13th. The 1964 World Champion retired when his engine blew and Bell finished sixth. In Mexico, the team only entered Surtees. He qualified 15th and finished eighth. \n Passage 3:Ince Blundell Hall is in Georgian style. It is constructed in brick with sandstone dressings, and has an L-shaped plan. The main block faces southeast; it is in two storeys with an attic, and has a front of nine bays. Richard Pollard and Nikolaus Pevsner describe the front as being in late English Baroque style, and consider that it was \"evidently inspired\" by the front of Buckingham Palace, London. Between the upper storey and the attic is an entablature with a cornice and a panelled parapet. The central three bays project forward, the lower storeys are flanked by pairs of giant pilasters, and at the sides of the central doorway are giant columns. There are more pilasters at the ends of the building, and in the central three bays of the attic. All the pilasters and columns are Corinthian in style. The windows are sashes and are surrounded by architraves. The ground floor windows in the central bays have segmental heads with keystones, and those in the outer bays have friezes and pediments carried on consoles. Below the upper floor windows are panelled aprons and consoles. The central doorway has a segmental head and a keystone carved with the Blundell arms.

A native of Morganton, he liked to call himself a \"country lawyer,\" and often told humorous stories in his Southern drawl. During his Senate career, Ervin was a legal defender of the Jim Crow laws and racial segregation, as the South's constitutional expert during the congressional debates on civil rights. Unexpectedly, he became a liberal hero for his support of civil liberties. He is remembered for his work in the investigation committees that brought down Senator Joseph McCarthy in 1954 and especially for his investigation of the Watergate scandal in 1972 that led to the resignation of Richard Nixon.\n Passage 2:Gorham's Rangers was one of the most famous and effective ranger units raised in the colonial North America. Formed by John Gorham, the unit served as the prototype for many subsequent ranger forces, including the better known Rogers' Rangers. The unit started out as a Massachusetts provincial auxiliary company, which means it was not part of the province's normal militia system. Recruited in the summer of 1744 at the start of King George's War, Governor William Shirley ordered the unit raised as reinforcements for the then-besieged British garrison at Fort Anne in Annapolis Royal. Over the next eight years the unit proved remarkably effective at suppressing Acadian and Mi'kmaq resistance to British rule in Nova Scotia and helped to both expand and secure the British sphere of influence in the region. Initially a sixty-man all-Indian company led by British colonial officers, the original Native American members of the unit were gradually replaced by Anglo-Americans and recent Scots and Irish immigrants and were a minority in the unit by the mid-1750s. The company were reconnaissance experts as well as renowned for their expertise at both water-borne operations and frontier guerrilla warfare. They were known for surprise amphibious raids on Acadian and Mi'kmaq coastal or riverine settlements, using large whaleboats, which carried between ten and fifteen rangers each. This small unit was the main British military force defending Nova Scotia from 1744 to 1749. The company became part of the British army and was expanded during the Seven Years' War and went on to play an important role in fighting in Nova Scotia as well as participating in many of the important campaigns of the war, particularly distinguishing itself at the Siege of Quebec in 1759.\n Passage 3:Anthony Sadler Jr. (born July 13, 1992) is an American-French television personality.

Recognized by then-U.S. President Barack Obama and French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, Sadler received several awards and decorations for his actions. He, along with his friends, was awarded the Legion of Honour by the French president which is the highest French order for military and civil merits. After the event, Sadler made several television appearances, including a guest appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and honored with the on Spike TV, among other appearances. He, Skarlatos and Stone co-authored a memoir, titled The 15:17 to Paris, published in August 2016, which detailed the events leading up to the attack, which occurred a year prior to the release of the book. Clint Eastwood directed a biographical based on Sadler, Skarlatos and Stone's memoir, starring them, along with actresses Jenna Fischer and Judy Greer.

He was stationed at Fort Lewis, Washington and assigned to the 15th Infantry Regiment of the 3rd Infantry Division. After the Japanese military attacked Pearl Harbor, his unit began training for war. The 3rd Infantry Division, with the 41st Infantry Division, were then part of IX Corps. In May 1941, the two divisions moved to the Hunter Liggett Military Reservation where June war games pitted them against Major General Joseph Stilwell's 7th Division and the 40th Division.

Passage 1:1973\u201374 was a big season for Newcastle United. The new attacking team put together by Harvey was being tipped to take one of the major honours come the season's end. By November Newcastle were second in the league, but they fell away to finish 15th, and in the League Cup they were knocked out in the third round. It was down to the FA Cup. Hendon were first up in the third round and a shock 2\u20132 draw at home meant that Newcastle had to go through a replay at Vicarage Road to see off the non-league side 3\u20130. Scunthorpe United were next up in the fourth round, and another shock 1\u20131 draw at St James' meant another replay against lower league opposition. Macdonald scored twice in the replay to crush Scunthorpe's hopes in a 3\u20130 win. The fifth round saw a difficult away draw to West Bromwich Albion, on a quagmire of a pitch and in front of the TV cameras. Newcastle were majestic, winning 3\u20130 with Macdonald scoring again. Newcastle faced Burnley at Hillsborough in the semi final. Macdonald scored two and Newcastle won 2\u20130; Harvey would sign Burnley defender Geoff Nulty for the next season after impressing in this game. Newcastle United were through to their first FA Cup final since 1955, where they would play Bill Shankly's Liverpool. Newcastle had a poor build up to final with preparations not going to plan: the tracksuit tops the players were meant to be wearing did not turn up, and they had to wear an unkind-looking purple outfit as they walked out at Wembley Stadium. Macdonald was the key man for Newcastle, having scored in every round for a total of eight goals in the competition. Liverpool played well and coasted to a 3\u20130 win with Kevin Keegan scoring twice. It was the end of an era for Harvey; the next season he signed Micky Burns and paid Sheffield Wednesday a club record \u00a3200,000 for Tommy Craig, but Newcastle could only finish a low 15th, despite getting some revenge on Liverpool, beating them 4\u20131 at St James' Park.\n Passage 2:In 1983 elections, N. T. Rama Rao came to power defeating the Indian National Congress. He praised the Naxalites for their patriotism before the elections. After coming to power, he demonstrated no significant change in government policy towards the revolutionary movement. Particularly after he was elected for a second time in 1985, his government put all its efforts to suppress the Naxalite movement in the state. Varavara Rao too was subjected to severe repression during this time. Six cases were foisted against him in 1985 alone. In July that year, along with functionaries of other people's organisations, he undertook an all India tour to make the people aware of the repression that was going on in Andhra Pradesh. After visiting Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, New Delhi and Tamil Nadu, Varavara Rao returned to Andhra Pradesh in September to attend court cases. Dr. Ramanatham, a pediatrician and civil liberties activist was a close friend of Varavara Rao. While killing Dr. Ramanatham, and on several other occasions, police openly declared that killing Varavara Rao was their aim. With his life at risk, Varavara Rao could not discharge his duties as Secretary of Virasam and spokesperson of revolutionary literary movement. He was not able to move freely in Andhra Pradesh. Warangal has become a forbidden place for him. Armed and unarmed ruffians and police in civil clothes attacked his house on several occasions. Persecution against his friends in the movement was also mounted. Taking into consideration all these developments, Varavara Rao chose to cancel his bail in Secunderabad Conspiracy Case. On his request, his bail was cancelled and he was sent to jail on 26 December 1985.\n Passage 3:The Ottoman Bosnian leadership led by Husein Grada\u0161\u010devi\u0107 were outraged when Sultan Mahmud II granted Serbia autonomy and subsequently six districts from the Bosnia Eyalet with the Treaty of Adrianople. Husein Grada\u0161\u010devi\u0107 had already begun to support the cause of the fallen Janissary after the Auspicious Incident and would not allow Mahmud II to further disintegrate Bosnian society. Instead of negotiating with Husein Grada\u0161\u010devi\u0107, the Grand Vizier Re\u015fid Mehmed Pasha (already engaged in an aggressive campaign against Albanian pashas and beys) mobilized his Ottoman army towards Travnik. Disappointed by Re\u015fid Pasha's move, Grada\u0161\u010devi\u0107 marched forward with an army of 52,000 into Pri\u0161tina, and later fought and defeated Re\u015fid Pasha at \u0160timlje. A Bosnian delegation reached the Grand Vizier's camp in Skopje in November of that year. The Grand Vizier promised this delegation that he would insist to the Sultan that he accept the Bosniak demands. His true intentions, however, were manifested by early December when his cannons attacked Bosnian units stationed on the outskirts of Novi Pazar. Re\u015fid Mehmed Pasha later began an aggressive campaign into Bosnia with the assistance of the renegade kapetan Ali-pa\u0161a Rizvanbegovi\u0107 and defeated the entire army of Bosnia Eyalet led by Husein Grada\u0161\u010devi\u0107 outside the town of Stup.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

A concept album, its themes explore conflict, greed, time, death, and mental illness, the latter partly inspired by the deteriorating health of founding member Syd Barrett, who departed the group in 1968. The group used recording techniques such as multitrack recording, tape loops, and analogue synthesisers. Snippets from interviews with the band's road crew, as well as philosophical quotations, were also used. Engineer Alan Parsons was responsible for many sonic aspects and the recruitment of singer Clare Torry, who appears on \"The Great Gig in the Sky\". The sleeve, which depicts a prism spectrum, was designed by Storm Thorgerson, following keyboardist Richard Wright's request for a \"simple and bold\" design, representing the band's lighting and the record's themes.

Youth newspaper carriers soon followed. These actions isolated youths' interests in the popular media of the times, and separated young people from their contemporary adult labor counterparts. This separation continued through the 1930s, when the American Youth Congress presented a \"Bill of Youth Rights\" to the US Congress. Their actions were indicative of a growing student movement present throughout the US from the 1920s through the early 1940s. The 1950s saw the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee bring young people into larger movements for civil rights. All the way back in 1959, Rev.

In 1842 New York City was one of the first cities in the U.S. to tap water resources outside the city limits. It dammed the Croton River in Westchester County, New York, and built an aqueduct from the reservoir to the city. Also in 1842, construction was completed on Chicago's first water works, with water mains made of cedar and a water intake located about into Lake Michigan. In 1848, Boston began construction of a water transmission system. A tributary of the Sudbury River was impounded creating Lake Cochituate, from where the Cochituate Aqueduct transported water to the Brookline Reservoir that fed the city's distribution system. In 1853 Washington, D.C. followed suit by beginning the construction of the Washington Aqueduct to provide water from the Great Falls on the Potomac River.\n Passage 2:In the Seven Years' War, he served as adjutant in the staff of Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick and on 1 August 1759 was wounded at Minden.

Passage 1:Bobby Lee Rodgers is an American musician who is currently a solo artist and leader of the Bobby Lee Rodgers Trio. He is a former member of The Codetalkers. Rodgers studied jazz and classical guitar at the University of Georgia. After his time at Georgia, Rodgers moved to Boston, where he taught jazz studies at the Berklee College of Music as their youngest instructor at age 23. Rodgers released his first solo album, Water Buffalo, in 1997 on ZC Records. In 1999, Rodgers formed The Codetalkers alongside Col. Bruce Hampton after meeting Hampton at the Variety Playhouse in Atlanta. The Codetalkers broke up in 2009, and Rodgers has since continued as a solo artist and as the leader of the Bobby Lee Rodgers Trio. On March 24, 2018, Rodgers supported the post-grunge act Bush at The Fillmore Miami. On May 5, 2018, Rodgers, along with Jimmie Vaughan and Blackfoot, supported Lynyrd Skynyrd at the MidFlorida Credit Union Amphitheatre in Tampa, Florida as part of Lynyrd Skynyrd's The Last of the Street Survivors Farewell Tour.\n Passage 2:During the Song dynasty the first series of standard government Jiaozi notes were issued in 1024 with denominations like 1 gu\u00e0n (\u8cab, or 700 w\u00e9n), 1 m\u00edn (\u7de1, or 1000 w\u00e9n), up to 10 gu\u00e0n. In 1039 only banknotes of 5 gu\u00e0n and 10 gu\u00e0n were issued, and in 1068 a denomination of 1 gu\u00e0n was introduced which became forty percent of all circulating Jiaozi banknotes. The Huizi also continued to use these currency units. Between the years of 1161 and 1166 the government of the Song dynasty had produced 28,000,000 d\u00e0o (\u9053, equal to a gu\u00e0n or 1000 w\u00e9n) in Huizi notes. The exchange rate between Guanzi banknotes and copper cash coins was 1 gu\u00e0n for 770 w\u00e9n while huizi notes of the eighteenth production period were valued at 3 gu\u00e0n for 1 w\u00e9n. During the last days of the Southern Song dynasty China was suffering from inflation to the poiint that the value of the Huizi had lowered so much that a gu\u00e0n was only accepted at between 300 and 400 cash coins, which caused people to start hoarding these coins and remove them from circulation which had a devastating effect on the economy. As the Mongols continued marching south the Chinese military required more money causing the government to print an excessive amount of Huizi banknotes. The gu\u00e0n currency unit would later also be used by the Jurchen Jin dynasty and the Mongol Yuan dynasty on their Jiaochao banknotes, though due to hyperinflation these currencies would not be able to be exchanged with any real cash coins and under Mongol rule non-paper forms of currency were abolished.\n Passage 3:The season began with two wins, but a run of one win in ten games then followed. In September, four of the five directors resigned, one of them (Len Cliff) stated that \"the club is being run by outsiders\". A new board was formed by November. Meanwhile, on 13 September the club suffered a loss of 7\u20133 at Gay Meadow to Shrewsbury Town, despite a Bobby Gough hat-trick \u2013 the match also saw a sending off, an attempted pitch invasion, and a \u00a335 fine for Gordon Lee for remarks he made to referee Ricky Nicholson. Tommy McLaren then returned from injury to lead Vale on a four match winning streak that included a 2\u20130 win over fallen-giants Aston Villa in front of a Burslem crowd of 11,224 fans. Four straight defeats soon came after this sequence however, as Vale's form was patchy. In December, Ron Wilson left the club as he emigrated to South Africa due to his son's ill health. A 1\u20130 defeat at Villa Park on 16 January was the first of a nine match streak without a victory. At the end of the month Lee signed John Brodie from Northern Premier League side Bradford Park Avenue for \u00a3250. During this spell forward Sammy Morgan began to be jeered by fans after losing his scoring touch. He also began studying to be a teacher. Lee said that \"I really feel some of our lads have been singled out by the boo boys. If only they realised that encouragement can lift players, things would be so much better\". In February, Mark Singer resigned as chairman, and was replaced by Graham Bourne. By then the club were hovering above the relegation zone, but a record of just ten goals conceded in their final twelve games was enough to secure safety, with Brian Horton in good form.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:The \"three now cosmopolitan commensal rodent pest species\" (the brown rat, the black rat and the house mouse) have been dispersed in association with humans, partly on sailing ships in the Age of Exploration, and with a fourth species in the Pacific, the Polynesian rat (Rattus exulans), have severely damaged island biotas around the world. For example, when the black rat reached Lord Howe Island in 1918, over 40 percent of the terrestrial bird species of the island, including the Lord Howe fantail, became extinct within ten years. Similar destruction has been seen on Midway Island (1943) and Big South Cape Island (1962). Conservation projects can with careful planning completely eradicate these pest rodents from islands using an anticoagulant rodenticide such as brodifacoum. This approach has been successful on the island of Lundy in the United Kingdom, where the eradication of an estimated 40,000 brown rats is giving populations of Manx shearwater and Atlantic puffin a chance to recover from near-extinction.\n Passage 2:He began his studies in Poland and continued his education at the University of Leuven. His considerable wealth enabled him to establish his own private army, which suppressed Cossack riots and Tatar raids in Ukraine. In 1635 he became the first voivode of the Czernih\u00f3w Voivodship. In 1646 he was appointed Field Crown Hetman. During the Khmelnytsky Uprising, he was captured by the Tatars after the Battle of Korsun in 1648. He was a prisoner-of-war until 1650 when he was ransomed. On 12 May 1651 he commanded victorious Polish army in the Battle of Kopyczy\u0144ce between Poles and combined Cossack-Tatar forces under chief Asand Demko. In 1651, during the subsequent hostilities between the Commonwealth and Cossack-Tatar alliance, he was the nominal commander of the Polish army right wing at the great victorious Battle of Beresteczko (de facto commanded Jeremi Wi\u015bniowiecki). Upon death of Grand Crown Hetman Miko\u0142aj Potocki, who was his political and personal adversary, hetman Kalinowski commanded the choicest elements of the Commonwealth army and he had at the camp at Batoh about 10\u201312,000 soldiers and 10\u201315,000 servants and camp followers. This army was surprised by the combined Cossack-Tatar army, consequently defeated and then capture of Polish soldiers and servants resulted in a wholesale slaughter of the best elements of Commonwealth army and their retinues, the event known as Battle of Batoh. Hetman was killed on 2 June 1652, during the last day of the battle, when trying to escape from the Cossack-Tatars-filled burning Polish camp, in woods some 3 kilometers from the Polish camp. Hetman's severed head was carried around the Cossack-Tatar camps, allegedly by the Nuredin-Sultan himself.\n Passage 3:In the late 1950s, Dunstan became well known for his campaign against the death penalty being imposed on Max Stuart, who was convicted of rape and murder of a small girl. He harried Premier Thomas Playford IV aggressively over the matter, creating an uproar over what he saw as an unfair process. Playford eventually relented, and appeared shaken thereafter; the event was seen as a turning point in the Liberal and Country League's decline, and Labor gained momentum. During Labor's time in opposition, Dunstan was prominent in securing some reforms in Aboriginal rights, and was at the forefront of Labor abandoning the White Australia Policy. Labor conducted an extensive campaign in marginal LCL seats at the 1965 election, resulting in 21 of 39 seats, with Frank Walsh and the Labor Party taking power and Dunstan becoming Attorney-General. The LCL opposition changed leaders and installed the young Steele Hall, worrying Labor as the elderly Walsh appeared bumbling in contrast. This resulted in Labor replacing Walsh with Dunstan. Despite maintaining a much larger vote over the LCL, Labor lost two seats at the 1968 election, with the LCL forming government with support of an independent. Dunstan responded by increasing his attacks on the Playmander and was able to convincingly sustain Playmander attacks with the effect of convincing the LCL into watering down the malapportionment. Again with little change in Labor's vote but with the Playmander removed, Labor won 27 of 47 seats at the 1970 election. With a fairer seat and boundary system in place, Dunstan won three more elections, in 1973, 1975 and 1977.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:The Dufek Coast is that portion of the coast along the southwest margin of the Ross Ice Shelf between Airdrop Peak on the east side of the Beardmore Glacier and Morris Peak on the east side of Liv Glacier. It was named by the New Zealand Antarctic Place-Names Committee in 1961 after Rear Admiral George J. Dufek, United States Navy, who served under Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd with the United States Antarctic Service, 1939\u201341, and as commander of the Eastern Task Force of U.S. Navy Operation Highjump, 1946\u201347. He was Commander of U.S. Naval Support Force Antarctica, 1954\u201359, a period in which the following American science stations were established: McMurdo Station, Little America V, Byrd Station, South Pole Station, Wilkes Station, Hallett Station and Ellsworth Station. United States Navy ships, aircraft, and personnel under his command provided broad logistical support to research and survey operations, including aerial photographic missions to virtually all sectors of Antarctica. On October 31, 1956, Dufek in the ski-equipped R4D Skytrain aircraft Que Sera Sera (pilot Lieutenant Commander Conrad Shinn), flew from McMurdo Sound via Beardmore Glacier to make the first airplane landing at the South Pole.\n Passage 2:The Royals began operations with General Manager Cedric Tallis, who soon developed a reputation as the best trader in the league. The first big trade was with fellow expansion team Seattle, which brought in 1969 Rookie of the Year Lou Piniella. In their inaugural game, on April 8, 1969, the Royals defeated the Minnesota Twins 4-3 in 12 innings. Two pitching stars from the Baltimore Orioles team that won the 1966 World Series pitched for the Royals in the inaugural game: Wally Bunker threw the franchise's very first pitch, and Moe Drabowsky won the game in relief. After finishing the season in 5th place, the Royals' next trade cemented a reputation as a speedy team. Third baseman Joe Foy was traded to the New York Mets for speedy outfielder Amos Otis, who would become the Royals' first star. Further one-sided trades brought to the Royals second baseman Cookie Rojas, bullpen ace Ted Abernathy, shortstop Fred Patek, first baseman John Mayberry and left fielder Hal McRae. The Royals also invested in a strong farm system and in the early years developed such future stars as pitchers Paul Splittorff and Steve Busby, infielders George Brett and Frank White, and outfielder Al Cowens.\n Passage 3:Stanley turned professional after the 2009 U.S. Open and made his pro debut a week later at the Travelers Championship. Late in 2010, Stanley earned a 2011 PGA Tour card through Q-School where he finished in a tie for ninth. In his debut season on tour, he recorded four top-10 finishes, with the best of these coming at the John Deere Classic where he finished runner-up to Steve Stricker by a single stroke. The runner-up finish did however help Stanley secure the final available spot at the 2011 Open Championship. It was his first ever appearance in an Open Championship and he made the cut to finish in a tie for 44th. He also made the third FedEx Cup playoff event, the BMW Championship, finishing tied for 10th, though that wasn't good enough to provide entrance to the final event of the year, The Tour Championship.

Joseph wanted to assist the war effort, and after considering work on the land or in a munitions factory, took up part-time welfare work in Islington. In the autumn of 1916 she began teaching at Eothen, a small private school for girls in Caterham, founded and run by the Misses Catharine and Winifred Pye. In 1917 Holst's ten-year-old daughter Imogen started at the school; soon, under Joseph's guidance the young pupil was composing her own music. Joseph extended her own musical activities by joining the orchestra at Morley College, where Holst was the director of music and where her brother Edwin had played the cello before the war. At first she played the double-bass, but later took French horn lessons, possibly from Adolph Borsdorf; later still, at very short notice, she taught herself the timpani part for a summer concert. By 1918 she was a member of the Morley committee that on 9 March organised and produced an opera burlesque, English Opera as She is Wrote, in which English, Italian, German, French and Russian opera styles were parodied in successive scenes. The performance was a great success and was repeated at several venues. It may have inspired Holst to use parody in his own opera, The Perfect Fool, which he began composing in 1918. In her spare time Joseph founded and ran a choir for Kensington nannies, which took part in local singing contests as the \"Linden Singers\".\n Passage 3:Roycroft was born in 1946 as the second of three sons to Bill Roycroft, an Olympic equestrian gold medallist, and his wife, Mavis.

On 1 January 1996, Manchester United were beaten 4\u20131 by Tottenham Hotspur and when Newcastle beat Bolton Wanderers 2-1 at home on 20 January 1996 they established what most presumed to be an insurmountable 12-point lead over their title rivals. However, the Manchester club began embarked upon what sports writer Ian Cusack described as \"a seemingly endless streak of 1-0 wins\", including a critical game at St James' Park on 4 March which saw Peter Schmeichel defy the hosts with several excellent saves before Eric Cantona scored a decisive break-away goal.

The song, which strays from her usual folk style with simple acoustic guitar instrumentation, starts off with a French accordion and then experiments with dance-oriented beats with subtle urban influences, using synthesizers. The song achieved moderate success in the United States, reaching number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. However, a number of Jewel's fans criticized her for abandoning her traditional folk style in exchange for a new pop sound.

He then spent two seasons in Sweden with Hudiksvalls FF returning to Lechia Gda\u0144sk for a season in 1992 making a further 18 league appearances. In total for Lechia Gda\u0144sk Cybulski made 211 appearances and scored 9 goals. He then had a season in Belgium with CS Jemappes, returning to Poland the season after joining Pomezania Malbork. He played with Pomezania in the 1994\u201395 season with the club finishing 9th in the II liga, the clubs highest ever league finish. After that historic season for Pomezania he returned to Ba\u0142tyk Gdynia, making a further 103 appearances over the next 5 seasons with Ba\u0142tyk, with a short 6-month spell at Wierzyca Starogard Gda\u0144ski in the middle of that 5 season spell. In total at Ba\u0142tyk Gdynia he made 142 league appearances scoring 9 times for the club. Cybulski spent the next five seasons with Cartusia Kartuzy in the fourth tier, helping the club to win promotion to the III liga in his final season. He then spent time with Orze\u0142 Tr\u0105bki Wielkie, KS Chwaszczyno, Sp\u00f3jnia Sadlinki, and GKS Kowale.\n Passage 2:Rizzo was called up to the majors after hitting .365 with an OPS of 1.159 along with 16\u00a0home runs and 63\u00a0RBI in 200\u00a0at-bats over 52\u00a0games in Tucson. The San Diego Union-Tribune called Rizzo \"the most celebrated Padres call-up\" since Roberto Alomar debuted with the team in 1988. Rizzo's promotion was prompted by the Padres' inadequate offensive production and fielding play of veterans at first base. In his debut on June 9, 2011, against the Washington Nationals, Rizzo struck out in his first at-bat, but then proceeded to hit a triple and score a run, helping the Padres to a 7\u20133 victory. He hit his first home run on June 11 against John Lannan. After three games he was 3-for-7 with a double, triple and a home run, while he demonstrated patience in drawing four walks for a .667 on-base percentage (OBP). On July 21, 2011 Rizzo was demoted back to Triple-A, and Blanks was promoted. Rizzo had struggled with only a .143 batting average and 1 home run, striking out 36 times in 98 at-bats. Hoyer said Rizzo \"worked hard, never made excuses, and endeared himself to his teammates\" during his initial stint in the majors. Rizzo was recalled to the majors on September 4 after finishing the season at Tucson batting .331 with 26\u00a0homers and 101\u00a0RBI in 93\u00a0games. He finished his first season in San Diego hitting only .141 with 46\u00a0strikeouts in 128\u00a0at-bats. Hoyer believed Rizzo would be the starting first baseman for the Padres in 2012 with Jes\u00fas Guzm\u00e1n as the second option. However, Yonder Alonso moved ahead of Rizzo on the team's depth chart after he was acquired by the Padres in December 2011 in a trade for Mat Latos.\n Passage 3:Through the entire river border, near the eastern shore, the Finnish national road 21/European route E8 runs between Tornio and Kilpisj\u00e4rvi.

His refugee status compelled these moves (his grandparents were Jewish, and by 1933 Jews were forbidden to attend German universities). In 1939 he escaped to the United States, where he was at first a research assistant at Yale. He taught at the University of Pennsylvania from 1948 until his retirement in 1985. He was a member of the Linguistic Society of America, of which he was elected President in 1958, and a member of the American Philosophical Society for more than 30 years.

At 18 he enrolled in and attended the School of Fine Arts of Ravenna. During World War II he was drafted and served from 1943 until 1946 in the Regia Marina (Italian Royal Navy) at La Spezia). After the war he returned to the School of Fine Arts, receiving his diploma in 1948. He enrolled in the School of Painting and Mosaics, also in Ravenna, graduating in 1951. From 1951 to 1955 he worked with the Gruppo mosaicisti of Ravenna and restored many mosaics. Also in 1951, at the end of November, he arrived in Paris to teach at the Ecole d'Art Italien (School of Italian Art) as an assistant to the painter Gino Severini, founder and director of the school. Together with another mosaicist, his fellow Ravennan Lino Melano, he executed mosaic works for artists including Fernand L\u00e9ger, Georges Braque, Marc Chagall, Jean Bazaine, and Raoul Ubac. He collaborated also on the mosaic for the fa\u00e7ade of the Mus\u00e9e national Fernand L\u00e9ger in Biot (Alpes-Maritimes). In 1960 he executed, at the Colombe d'Or of Saint-Paul-de-Vence, a mosaic by the painter Georges Braque. From 1961 he had a studio in the artists' residence La Ruche at 2, passage de Dantzing in Paris, the place described by Lorenzo Viani in the book Parigi 1925 (Paris 1925), published by Fratelli Treves. In 1962, in another collaboration with Braque, he created the famous long fish tank of the Fondation Maeght in St Paul de Vence. His collaborations with many illustrious artists continued; the last was Jean-Michel Folon. Many of his personal works in painting and mosaics are in prominent private and public collections. The latter portion of his life was spent in an old people's rest home in Paris, where he died in 2008.\n Passage 2:Paul was a McDonald's All-American in high school. He attended Wake Forest University for two years of college basketball, where he helped the Demon Deacons achieve their first-ever number one ranking. He was selected fourth overall in the 2005 NBA draft by the New Orleans Hornets, where he developed into one of the league's premier players, finishing second in NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting in 2008. During the 2011 offseason, Paul was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, only for the transaction to be controversially voided by the NBA. Later that summer, he was dealt to the Los Angeles Clippers instead. Behind Paul's playmaking, the Clippers developed a reputation for their fast-paced offense and spectacular alley-oop dunks, earning them the nickname \"Lob City\". In 2017, he was traded to the Houston Rockets, and helped the team win a franchise-record 65 games in his debut season. He was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder for Russell Westbrook on July 16, 2019.\n Passage 3:The Stargate Command setting was transferred from the fictional military facility located in Creek Mountain, to the Cheyenne Mountain military complex. The unnamed planet from the film was named Abydos in the series and the distance from Earth changed from millions of light-years away (in an entirely different galaxy, \"the Kalium galaxy\") to becoming the closest planet to Earth with a Stargate, residing in the same galaxy as Earth. Also in SG-1, Stargate travel is limited to the Stargate network in the Milky Way galaxy (unless a tremendous amount of power is used to lengthen the subspace wormhole of a Stargate to another galaxy's Stargate). Ra was the last of an unnamed race in the film, being of a humanoid species with large black eyes and a lack of facial features. In SG-1, Ra is one of many \"Goa'uld System Lords,\" who are a race of parasitic eel-like creatures. There were also changes to the Stargate. The unique set of 39 Stargate symbols in the film were replaced with the concept of 38 symbols that are the same for each Stargate (Earth's symbols based on Earth's constellations), plus a single point of origin symbol that is unique to that individual gate. While the kawoosh effect in the movie was created by filming the actual swirl of water in a glass tube, and looked like a vortex on the back of the Gate; on the TV series this effect was completely created in computer graphics by the Canadian visual effects company Rainmaker. At the beginning of season 9, the original movie wormhole sequence was substituted by a new sequence similar to the one already used on Stargate Atlantis, but being blue as it was in the movie and SG-1, whereas in Atlantis it is green and in Universe, it's white.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:In November 1988, a new development team within Microsoft (which included former Digital Equipment Corporation developers Dave Cutler and Mark Lucovsky) began work on a revamped version of IBM and Microsoft's OS/2 operating system known as \"NT OS/2\". NT OS/2 was intended to be a secure, multi-user operating system with POSIX compatibility and a modular, portable kernel with preemptive multitasking and support for multiple processor architectures. However, following the successful release of Windows 3.0, the NT development team decided to rework the project to use an extended 32-bit port of the Windows API known as Win32 instead of those of OS/2. Win32 maintained a similar structure to the Windows APIs (allowing existing Windows applications to easily be ported to the platform), but also supported the capabilities of the existing NT kernel. Following its approval by Microsoft's staff, development continued on what was now Windows NT, the first 32-bit version of Windows. However, IBM objected to the changes, and ultimately continued OS/2 development on its own.\n Passage 2:\"Lisa the Skeptic\" is the eighth episode of The Simpsons' ninth season. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 23, 1997. On an archaeological dig with her class, Lisa discovers a skeleton that resembles an angel. All of the townspeople believe that the skeleton actually came from an angel, but skeptical Lisa attempts to persuade them that there must be a rational scientific explanation. The episode's writer, David X. Cohen, developed the idea after visiting the American Museum of Natural History, and decided to loosely parallel themes from the Scopes Monkey Trial. The episode also makes allusions to actual hoaxes, such as the Cardiff Giant. \n Passage 3:In the world of sports, mascots are also used for merchandising. Team mascots are often related to their respective team nicknames. This is especially true when the team's nickname is something that is a living animal and/or can be made to have humanlike characteristics. For more abstract nicknames, the team may opt to have an unrelated character serve as the mascot. For example, the athletic teams of the University of Alabama are nicknamed the Crimson Tide, while their mascot is an elephant named Big Al. Team mascots may take the form of a logo, person, live animal, inanimate object, or a costumed character, and often appear at team matches and other related events, sports mascots are often used as marketing tools for their teams to children. Since the mid-20th century, costumed characters have provided teams with an opportunity to choose a fantasy creature as their mascot, as is the case with the Philadelphia Phillies' mascot, the Phillie Phanatic, and the Philadelphia Flyers' mascot, Gritty.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

He was the son of an English silk dyer who was usually accounted to have emigrated to Copenhagen, Denmark, among the retinue of Princess Louisa, a daughter of George\u00a0II, upon her marriage to Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark in 1743. (The prince became King\u00a0Frederick\u00a0V three years later.) Other sources suggest the father immigrated earlier, in 1738. The father established himself as a hosier in 1744, and Charles seems to have benefited from the warm reception that Louisa and her retinue received from the Danes. On 5 July 1747, Charles petitioned the University of Copenhagen's Consortium for admission to study history, antiquities, philosophy, and mathematics. This seems to have been granted, although students were generally required to adhere to the Danish Church and Bertram remained Anglican. He became a friend and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Hans Gram, the royal librarian and a member of the privy council. On 23 March 1748, Bertram petitioned the king to be permitted to give public lectures on the English language and became a teacher of English in the Royal Marine Academy in Copenhagen. (Some accounts name him as a professor, rather than a tutor; if so, that status would have been granted some years later, as he was a new undergraduate in 1747.) His 1749 chrestomathy An Essay on the Excellency and Style of the English Tongue has been called the initiation of English-language printing in Denmark. A brother apparently died at sea in 1752, and at some point he married Cathrine Marie Gold.\n Passage 3:The Divine was published in the U.S. by First Second Books, featuring a blurb by author Yann Martel, best known for the international bestseller Life of Pi. It was released in July 2015 and has hit the New York Times Best Sellers list. It has since received highly positive reviews. Publishers Weekly had chosen The Divine for \"top ten graphic novel for spring 2015\", describing it later on as: \"Heady, hellacious, and phantasmagoric\". Jesse Karp on his Booklist review wrote: \"Stunning artwork and creeping dread weave together in this satisfying and moving page-turner\". Douglas Wolk from The New York Times described it as \"a too rare example of artists getting top billing\", referring to the artwork by Asaf and Tomer Hanuka.

In the 1930s, he typically appeared as part of a comic trio with Mickey and Goofy and was given his own film series in 1937 starting with Don Donald. These films introduced Donald's love interest Daisy Duck and often included his three nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie. After the 1956 film Chips Ahoy, Donald appeared primarily in educational films before eventually returning to theatrical animation in Mickey's Christmas Carol (1983).

In 1929 Charles rode for Burnley, in 1930 for Manchester White City and then for Leeds Lions and Belle Vue in 1931 but was badly injured and lost his form, and so retired from the sport.

Passage 1:D\u00e1l Riata is said to have been founded by the legendary king Fergus M\u00f3r (Fergus the Great) in the 5th century. The kingdom reached its height under \u00c1ed\u00e1n mac Gabr\u00e1in (). During his reign D\u00e1l Riata's power and influence grew; it carried out naval expeditions to Orkney and the Isle of Man, and assaults on the Brittonic kingdom of Strathclyde and Anglian kingdom of Bernicia. However, King \u00c6thelfrith of Bernicia checked its growth at the Battle of Degsastan in 603. Serious defeats in Ireland and Scotland during the reign of Domnall Brecc (died 642) ended D\u00e1l Riata's \"golden age\", and the kingdom became a client of Northumbria for a time. In the 730s the Pictish king \u00d3engus I led campaigns against D\u00e1l Riata and brought it under Pictish overlordship by 741. There is disagreement over the fate of the kingdom from the late 8th century onwards. Some scholars have seen no revival of D\u00e1l Riatan power after the long period of foreign domination ( to ), while others have seen a revival under \u00c1ed Find (736\u2013778). Some even claim that the D\u00e1l Riata usurped the kingship of Fortriu. From 795 onward there were sporadic Viking raids in D\u00e1l Riata. In the following century, there may have been a merger of the D\u00e1l Riatan and Pictish crowns. Some sources say Cin\u00e1ed mac Ailp\u00edn (Kenneth MacAlpin) was king of D\u00e1l Riata before becoming king of the Picts in 843, following a disastrous defeat of the Picts by Vikings. The kingdom's independence ended sometime after, as it merged with Pictland to form the Kingdom of Alba.\n Passage 2:Three songs have been used for the reality television series So You Think You Can Dance. \"Ramalama (Bang Bang)\" was used for a group performance on the sixth week of the second season. Contestants wore costumes and make-up to show them as zombies in a performance combining the 1968 horror film Night of the Living Dead with Michael Jackson's 1983 music video for \"Thriller\". At the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards, the performance was part of a three-way tie for Outstanding Choreography with a So You Think You Can Dance performance of C\u00e9line Dion's \"Calling You\", choreographed by Mia Michaels, and the television special Tony Bennett: An American Classic. \"Night of the Dancing Flame\" was used for a couple's jazz dance in the fourth week of the following season with contestants Neil Haskell and Lauren Gottlieb.

Passage 1:Casser lived in Liverpool in the late 1950s, having previously worked in the Merchant Navy. As singer and rhythm guitarist, he formed a trio, Cass & the Cassanovas, in May 1959, with singer and guitarist Adrian Barber (born 13 November 1938, Ilkley, Yorkshire), and drummer and singer Brian J. Hudson (born Brian James Hudson, 21 April 1938, Cleveland, Yorkshire). After a few months, Hudson left and was replaced by Johnny Hutchinson (born 18 July 1940, Malta), known as Johnny Hutch. In need of a bass guitarist, Hutchinson then brought in Johnny Gustafson (born 8 August 1942, Liverpool) in December 1959. At that time Gustafson did not have a proper bass guitar so Barber converted an acoustic for him. The group became popular playing a wide range of music, from Latin American music to rock and roll, in dance halls in the Liverpool area. Casser also started his own music club in Liverpool, the Casanova Club, whose guest groups included one known at the time as the \"Silver Beetles\"; according to some reports, Casser had suggested that they change their name from the earlier spelling of \"Beatals\" which Casser found \"ridiculous\". In May 1960 Cass & the Cassanovas took part in auditions in front of leading manager Larry Parnes who was looking for backing bands for his stable of pop singers. The group secured a place as backing group for singer Duffy Power and toured with him. By this time, Casser had begun using the stage names of \"Casey Jones\" and \"Casey Valence\".\n Passage 2:In March 2006, several men nominated for life peerages by then Prime Minister Tony Blair were rejected by the House of Lords Appointments Commission. It was later revealed they had loaned large amounts of money to the governing Labour Party, at the suggestion of Labour fundraiser Lord Levy. Suspicion was aroused by some that the peerages were a quid pro quo for the loans. This resulted in three complaints to the Metropolitan Police by Scottish National Party MP Angus MacNeil, Plaid Cymru parliamentary leader Elfyn Llwyd, and a third individual who continues to remain unidentified, as a breach of the law against selling honours. The investigation was headed by Assistant Commissioner John Yates who later resigned over the News of the World phone hacking scandal. During the investigation various members of the Labour Party (including Tony Blair), the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats were questioned, and Labour's Lord Levy was arrested and later released on bail. The investigation continued to have political impact throughout, as a range of stories continued to leak from the police investigation and damaged the government and Labour Party.\n Passage 3:Coldingham Priory was a house of Benedictine monks. It lies on the south-east coast of Scotland, in the village of Coldingham, Berwickshire. Coldingham Priory was founded in the reign of David I of Scotland, although his older brother and predecessor King Edgar of Scotland had granted the land of Coldingham to the Church of Durham in 1098, and a church was constructed by him and presented in 1100. The first prior of Coldingham is on record by the year 1147, although it is likely that the foundation was much earlier. The earlier monastery at Coldingham was founded by St \u00c6bbe sometime c. 640 AD. Although the monastery was largely destroyed by Oliver Cromwell in 1650, some remains of the priory exist, the choir of which forms the present parish church of Coldingham and is serviced by the Church of Scotland.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Glen's father was a blues guitarist, her grandmother a gospel singer, and her mother was friends with the blues guitarist B.B. King. Her mother Dell graduated from the University of Chicago and went on to become a successful banker who worked for Merrill Lynch. Glen's father, an American patriot who joined the military at a young age, became an engineer based in Frankfurt, Germany. Like many other children in Chicago's historic Bronzeville neighborhood (also known as the Black Metropolis) who received gifts and inspiration from folks like Muddy Waters and BB King, Marla was given a toy harmonica as a child, and her musical talent became immediately apparent. She was only 11 years old when she wrote her first song, \"Repertoire\", a title that has won three gold records and one platinum, and appears on her 1996 release, Love and Respect.\n Passage 2:Levette J. Davidson was a nationally acclaimed expert in folklore, especially that of Colorado and the West. He was born in Eureka, Illinois May 16, 1894, one of four children.

At the end of the war, Davidson simultaneously taught and studied at the University of Michigan where he earned a Ph.D. in languages and literatures in 1922. He arrived in Denver later that year and began teaching at the University of Denver. Before arriving in Colorado, his academic specialty was eighteenth century England. Once in Denver, he realized that Western literature and folklore would be his life work. Davidson taught at the University of Denver until his death in 1957. His course topics ranged from studies of Shakespeare and other English literature, to folklore in the West. He began teaching news writing and eventually founded the journalism department at the University as well as the board of publications and the press club. He was the first faculty member elected to serve as president of the University Senate. In 1940 he became head of the English Department and from March to August 1953 he served as interim Chancellor.

Tunku Abdul Rahman then expressed these concerns in December 1966 and called on the United States and the United Kingdom to provide increased logistical support to war efforts in Vietnam. Malaysia hosted training courses in public administration and jungle warfare for government officials, and provided motorcycles to bolster the South Vietnamese police and military logistical capabilities.

Passage 1:Hispanos identify strongly with their Spanish heritage and most are also mestizos of mixed Apache, Comanche, Pueblo, Navajo, Native Mexican, and Gen\u00edzaro ancestry. Exact numbers for the population size of New Mexican Hispanos is difficult, as many also identify with Chicano and Mexican-American movements. For most of its modern history, New Mexico existed on the periphery of the Spanish empire from 1598 until 1821 and later Mexico (1821\u20131848), but was dominated by Comancheria politically and economically from the 1750s to 1850s. Due to the Comanche, contact with the rest of Spanish America was limited, and New Mexican Spanish developed closer trading links with the Comanche than the rest of New Spain. In the meantime, some Spanish colonists coexisted with and intermarried with Puebloan peoples and Navajos, enemies of the Comanche. New Mexicans of all ethnicities were commonly enslaved by the Comanche and Apache of Apacheria, while Native New Mexicans were commonly enslaved and adopted Spanish language and culture. These Gen\u00edzaros served as house servants, sheep herders, and in other capacities in New Mexico including what is known today as Southern Colorado well into the 1800s. By the late 18th century, Gen\u00edzaros and their descendants, often referred to as Coyotes, comprised nearly one-third of the entire population of New Mexico. After the Mexican\u2013American War, New Mexico and all its inhabitants came under the governance of the English-speaking United States, and for the next hundred years, English-speakers increased in number. By the 1980s, more and more Hispanos were using English instead of New Mexican Spanish at home.\n Passage 2:On 13 December 2008 it was reported on ESPN Deportes that the Los Angeles Galaxy had made a $10\u00a0million offer to Internacional for D'Alesandro but was declined. Their vice president Fernando Carvalho was quoted; \"The offer came from the Los Angeles Galaxy of the United States. I didn't even want to listen to the details. The offer was for more money than we paid for D'Alessandro, who arrived here for five million euro, but we want to keep the Argentinian.\" D'Alessandro has become one of Internacional's most idolized players of all time along the likes of Falc\u00e3o, Valdomiro, and Fernand\u00e3o. In 2008, he was part of Inter's Sulamericana Championship. In 2009 Internacional finished in second place in both the Brasileir\u00e3o and Copa do Brasil. In 2010, D'Alessandro led Internacional to their second Libertadores Championship, and was elected the best player in South America for that year; in the 2010 FIFA Club World Cup, he also helped Internacional to a third-place finish, and was awarded the Bronze Ball as the tournament's third best player. In 2011 D'Alessadro had personally an even better year, but Internacional only managed to win the State Gaucho Championship. 2012 was a bad year for both Internacional and D'Alessandro. Furthermore, rumours of him leaving to play in China caused a major distraction; after long drawn out drama he stayed but soon was injured. In 2013 his game improved again, and while Inter only won the State Championship, he was praised as the only positive factor of the team that year. 2014 started well; D'Alessandro continued to play well and led Inter to their 4th straight Gaucho Championship.\n Passage 3:At the time, the term \"Southern Syria\" referred to a political position which implied support for the Greater Syria nationalism associated with the kingdom promised to the Hashemites of the Hejaz by the British during World War I. After the war, the Hashemite prince Faisal attempted to establish such a Pan-Syrian or pan-Mashriq state (i.e. a united kingdom that would comprise all of modern Syria, as well as Mount Lebanon and Palestine, including Transjordan, so that Palestine would be the province of \"Southern Syria\"). This kingdom was to be united with the other Hashemite domains in Hejaz and Iraq, thus contributing in large measure towards the fulfillment of Pan-Arabist ambitions. However, he was stymied by conflicting promises made by the British to different parties (see Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement, Balfour Declaration and McMahon\u2013Hussein Correspondence), leading to the Franco-Syrian War, which destroyed the Arab Kingdom of Syria in 1920.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

The main block faces southeast; it is in two storeys with an attic, and has a front of nine bays. Richard Pollard and Nikolaus Pevsner describe the front as being in late English Baroque style, and consider that it was \"evidently inspired\" by the front of Buckingham Palace, London. Between the upper storey and the attic is an entablature with a cornice and a panelled parapet. The central three bays project forward, the lower storeys are flanked by pairs of giant pilasters, and at the sides of the central doorway are giant columns. There are more pilasters at the ends of the building, and in the central three bays of the attic. All the pilasters and columns are Corinthian in style. The windows are sashes and are surrounded by architraves. The ground floor windows in the central bays have segmental heads with keystones, and those in the outer bays have friezes and pediments carried on consoles. Below the upper floor windows are panelled aprons and consoles. The central doorway has a segmental head and a keystone carved with the Blundell arms.

Now facing a 17-0 deficit, the Bills offense self-destructed on their next drive. Facing 3rd and 8, Jim Kelly was sacked by linebacker Kevin Green and fumbled the ball. Center Kent Hull recovered the fumble for Buffalo, but it didn't help much. On the next play, Lee Flowers stormed into the backfield and tackled punter Chris Mohr on the Bills 12-yard line, leading to another Johnson field goal that gave Pittsburgh a 20-0 lead. Buffalo responded with a drive to the Steelers 30-yard line, only to lose the ball when Lake forced a fumble from Thurman Thomas that was recovered by defensive back Chris Oldham.

During the U.S. Presidential campaign of 1844, he gave stump speeches for Henry Clay due to the Whig Party's platform that opposed admitting Texas into the Union because it was a slave state. In the U.S. Presidential campaign of 1848, Gibson supported Whig candidate, \"Rough and Ready\" General Zachary Taylor. However, he was concerned about the Whig Party's lack of opposition to the abolition of slavery and personally visited Henry Clay at his home in Ashland, Kentucky in 1848 to discuss this issue. He lost as a Whig candidate for Ohio Attorney General in 1853. In 1853, following the large defeat of the Whig candidate General Winfield Scott in the U.S. Presidential election of 1852, Gibson threw his support to the Free Soil Party and began organizing what would become the Republican Party in Ohio.

Passage 1:As early as 500 BC, the Treveri, a people of mixed Celtic and Germanic stock, from whom the Latin name for the city of Trier, Augusta Treverorum, is also derived, settled in Veldenz's fertile valley. After them, from about 50 BC to AD 500 came the Romans. Possibly about the year 1129, Gerlach I built a castle, today's Schloss Veldenz. In 1286, Rudolph of Habsburg granted Veldenz town and market rights. By 1444, the castle and its environs had passed to the Counts of Palatinate-Zweibr\u00fccken, or between 1543 and 1694 the Principality of Palatinate-Veldenz. In 1752, in Burgen near Veldenz, the widely known robber, Johann Peter Petri, also known as Schwarzer Peter (\u201cBlack Peter\u201d), was born. From 1777 to 1797, Veldenz belonged to Bavaria.

His two goals for the club both came in his second starting appearance in a 3\u20131 win over Luton Town on 26 February 2005. In June 2005 Championship side Preston North End signed him to a contract. As Hibbert was under the age of 23, the fee was decided by a tribunal according to UEFA regulations. Preston were ordered to pay Port Vale \u00a335,000 up front with add ons of \u00a310,000 for each 10 of his first 50 appearances for Preston (Vale would only receive the first of these due to him only making 13 appearances in total for Preston); a \u00a3280,000 bonus if Preston achieved promotion to the Premiership; plus a 25% sell-on clause if Hibbert was sold on.

Bianca Grace of Idolator noted that the performance \"will have you repenting your weekend sins, as the singer emotionally sings the tune.\" \"Devil Pray\" was performed on Madonna's 2015\u201316 Rebel Heart Tour. Following the Last Supper-themed mashup performance of \"Holy Water\" and \"Vogue\", Madonna climbed down to the center stage to perform \"Devil Pray\"; during the performance she straddled one of her male dancers, who was dressed as a priest, and engaged in a dance-off with other dancers. Jordan Zivitz from the Montreal Gazette said that she found the performance to be \"challenging\".

Passage 1:The first five stages took place in and around Andalusia in southern Spain; the 2014 Vuelta had also started there. The first stage was a team time trial along the coast from Puerto Ban\u00fas to Marbella. The next four stages were fairly flat, although Stage 2 finished on a moderately difficult climb. The sixth stage started in C\u00f3rdoba and finished in Sierra de Cazorla in Ja\u00e9n on another moderately difficult climb. The seventh stage then returned to Andalusia for the first major difficulty of the race: the first-category summit finish at La Alpujarra. The route then continued along the eastern coast of Spain, with a medium-mountain seventh stage and another first-category summit finish at Benitachell on Stage 9. There was one more medium-mountain stage on Stage 10, taking the riders into the Province of Castell\u00f3n.

Passage 1:By the early 1890s he had moved away from Bavaria and, with his brother, was working in Duisburg. Together the brothers smuggled subversive anarchist literature into Germany from the Netherlands. Coming under increasing police pressure, and taking his queue from a number of other anarchist comrades in a similar predicament, early in 1892 he fled to the United States of America. On his arrival at New York he met up with the circle around Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman, and politically like-minded comrades from Germany. Sepp Orter discovered in himself a talent for activism, turning out to have a flair for public speaking. During 1892 he was also the editor of the New York version of , published by the \"Radical Workers' Association\" (\"Radikaler Arbeiter Bund\") and the \"Autonomy\" group which also numbered among its members Josef Peukert. The stay in America was cut short, however. The authorities suspected that Oerter had somehow been involved in Alexander Berkman's attempt to assassinate a wealthy businessman called Henry Clay Frick. Those suspicions appear not to have been entirely unfounded. With financial assistance from Emma Goldman, Sepp Oerter returned to Germany. He travelled via London where he arrived in October, and where the editorial group publishing \"Autonomy\" gave him a mission to take printed material across Belgium to the German frontier in order to effect a clandestine introduction of the anarchist propaganda to Germany.

Carlotta, the third named storm of the 2018 Pacific hurricane season, formed as the result of a breakdown in the Intertropical Convergence Zone. On June 12, a broad area of low pressure developed several hundred miles south of Mexico and strengthened into a tropical storm by June 15. The next day, the system stalled unexpectedly within a favorable environment, which led to more intensification than originally anticipated. Early on June 17, Carlotta reached peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 997 mbar (29.44 inHg) while located only 30 mi (50 km) south-southeast of Acapulco. The system then began to interact with land and experience wind shear, which resulted in the storm weakening to tropical depression status later in the day. The system weakened to a remnant low early on June 19 and dissipated several hours later.\n Passage 3:Despite the perceived improbability of landfall in the days preceding the storm's passage, the West Palm Beach chapter of the American Red Cross began preparing for the storm. Dr. William J. Buck, likely the only doctor between Pahokee and Moore Haven and also president of the Belle Glade town council and the founder of the town's American Legion post, was skeptical of the Weather Bureau's predictions of the storm missing South Florida. He and his legionnaires warned residents in the Lake Okeechobee region of the approaching cyclone. At South Bay, Frank Schuster made several car trips to save 211\u00a0people by transporting them to higher ground. The Seminoles at the Brighton Seminole Indian Reservation in Glades County evacuated to higher ground after observing retreating wildlife. Hours before the storm made landfall, many in the communities surrounding Lake Okeechobee either crowded into a house or evacuated to the building they believed was securest, such as the Belle Glade Hotel, the Glades Hotel, and Henry Martin's store in Belle Glade, with the Glades Hotel sheltering 20\u00a0people and the Belle Glade Hotel having nearly 150\u00a0refugees. About 500\u00a0people in Lake Worth were sheltered inside the Gulf Stream Hotel during the storm. In West Palm Beach, food and thousands of candles, kerosene lamps, and boards were sold on September\u00a016. A number of residents boarded up their homes and then secured their ornamental trees and plants. At the building then being used as the Palm Beach County Courthouse, approximately 500\u00a0people sought shelter inside. In Jupiter, 20\u00a0people sought refuge in a grocery store, while 25\u00a0others stayed at a newly constructed elementary school.

The Melkite Greek Catholics and the Greek Orthodox, tend to focus more on the Greco-Hellenistic heritage of the region from the days of the Byzantine Empire, and the fact that Greek was maintained as a liturgical language until very recently. Some Lebanese even claim partial descent from Crusader knights who ruled Lebanon for a couple of centuries during the Middle Ages, also backed by recent genetic studies which confirmed this among Lebanese people, especially in the north of the country that was under the Crusader County of Tripoli. This identification with non-Arab civilizations also exists in other religious communities, albeit not to the same extent.\n Passage 3:Former Black Sabbath members vocalist Ronnie James Dio and drummer Vinny Appice formed Dio in October 1982 in the United States with bassist Jimmy Bain and guitarist Vivian Campbell. The band released their debut album, Holy Diver in May 1983. Since Ronnie James Dio and Jimmy Bain had played keyboards on the record, they recruited keyboardist Claude Schnell for live shows in 1983 and the following Holy Diver tour. Claude Schnell would later become a full member of Dio, and the band's first recorded effort as a quintet would be 1984's The Last in Line. The band proceeded to release Sacred Heart in 1985 and The Dio E.P. in 1986 before Campbell was fired from the band. The remaining members were joined by guitarist Craig Goldy to release Dream Evil in 1987 before the departure of Bain, Appice and Schnell. They would not play in Dio together again, however Appice would return to the band between 1993 and 1998 as well as Bain between 1999 and 2004.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:In his final year at Washington in 2014, Thompson was awarded the fifth annual Paul Hornung Award, given to the nation's most versatile player. He was named first-team All-America by ESPN, CBS Sports, Scout.com and SB Nation. He announced on January 5, 2015 that he would forgo his senior season and enter the 2015 NFL Draft. He was named a Midseason All-American by ESPN, NFL.com, CBS Sports and Phil Steele. He was listed as the national defensive player of the year by three of six writers on the CBS Sports panel. He scored six touchdowns in 2014, two as a running back and four on defense (one interception return and three fumble returns). He was named a first-team preseason All-America by Athlon. He made SI.com's preseason All-America second team. He was also named to the preseason watch list for both the Bednarik (top defensive player) and Paul Hornung (most versatile player) Awards. He started each of the Huskies' games for the season. In a victory over Eastern Washington, he notched 15 tackles, including a sack, forced a fumble and also had three carries for 66 yards, including a 57-yard touchdown run. He was named the national defensive player of the week by the Walter Camp Foundation and Athlon's following a two-touchdown performance vs. Illinois, where he scored on a 36-yard interception return and on a 52-yard fumble return, becoming the first Husky on record to have scored two defensive touchdowns in the same game. He scored his third defensive touchdown (and fourth overall) vs. Stanford, returning a fumble (that he forced) 32 yards for a score. He also had seven tackles, including one for a loss, and forced another fumble vs. the Cardinal. He scored on a 100-yard fumble return in the win at Cal, where he was a game captain. He is one of just four 100-yard plays in University of Washington history (others were a punt return by Hugh McElhenny and kickoff returns by Paul Arnold and John Ross). He also had a game-high 11 tackles against the Bears, and was named the National Defensive Player of the Week by Athlon, as well as Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Week, following the Cal game. He played mostly running back vs. Arizona State, gaining 98 yards on 21 carries, and also caught two passes for 15 yards. He started at tailback at Colorado, rushing for 174 yards and a touchdown on just 15 carries (11.6-yard average), leading this to be named the team's offensive player of the game after the win in Boulder. He made a second straight start at tailback, but also saw a good deal of action on the defense, vs. UCLA, when he was a game captain. He rushed for 100 yards on 16 carries vs. the Bruins, while also notching four tackles. He played only on defense and special teams at Arizona, finishing with three tackles. He made five tackles in the Apple Cup win at Washington State. He posted 10 tackles, including half of a tackle for loss, in the Cactus Bowl. He was tied for second in the nation with four fumble recoveries. Following his junior season, Thompson declared for the 2015 NFL Draft.\n Passage 2:Cronkite lived in Kansas City, Missouri, until he was ten, when his family moved to Houston, Texas. He attended elementary school at Woodrow Wilson Elementary School, junior high school at Lanier Junior High School (now Lanier Middle School) and high school at San Jacinto High School, where he edited the high school newspaper. He was a member of the Boy Scouts. He attended college at the University of Texas at Austin (UT), entering in the Fall term of 1933, where he worked on the Daily Texan and became a member of the Nu chapter of the Chi Phi Fraternity. He also was a member of the Houston chapter of DeMolay, a Masonic fraternal organization for boys. While attending UT, Cronkite had his first taste of performance, appearing in a play with fellow student Eli Wallach. He dropped out in 1935, not returning for the Fall term, in order to concentrate on journalism.\n Passage 3:The band originated from a surf rock-influenced garage rock group, the Sanctions, in 1965. The Sanctions, which included James Lowe (vocals, guitar), Mark Tulin (bass guitar), Ken Williams (lead guitar), and Michael \"Quint\" Weakley (drums), recorded 12 cover songs on an acetate disc on March 27, 1965, in a home studio owned by Russ Bottomley. For their next set of recordings on September 29, 1965, the group, then known as Jim and the Lords, was joined by keyboardist Dick Hargrave, who left shortly afterwards to pursue a career in graphic arts. The songs went unreleased until Heartbeat Productions distributed the 2000 album, Then Came The Electric Prunes, which was commended for its good sound quality, considering the circumstances in which it was recorded. Back to a quartet, the band, while rehearsing in a garage, met a real estate agent named Barbara Harris. Harris had connections in the music industry, and introduced the group to Dave Hassinger to record demos at Sky Hill Studios. Hassinger, who had been working as the resident sound engineer at RCA Studios, recently completed development for The Rolling Stones' album, Aftermath, and expressed a desire to produce a record. He suggested to the group that they change their name, and they considered a list of alternatives. According to Lowe, the name Electric Prunes started off as a joke, but he eventually convinced other band members, saying, \"It's the one thing everyone will remember. It's not attractive, and there's nothing sexy about it, but people won't forget it.\" As a result of the recordings, a single, featuring a cover of the Gypsy Trips' folk rock tune, \"Ain't It Hard\", and the Lowe-penned song, \"Little Olive\", was released in early 1966, but failed to chart.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:Harwood was born in Barton Seagrave, a suburb of Kettering, but grew up in Yorkshire. She attended Skipton Girls' High School. Her parents were both musical, and her mother, a professional soprano, taught her singing. Harwood later said of her childhood, \"My mother sang under the name Constance Read, and she did quite a bit of early broadcasting from Birmingham. When she had her children \u2013 there were three of us \u2013 she did local singing and took up her teaching. My father, in the Methodist Chapel tradition, did a good deal of conducting\". Harwood continued her studies at the Royal Manchester College of Music from 1956. In 1957, for the Buxton Opera Group, she sang Michaela in Passion Flower, an adaptation of Carmen. In a student production of Massenet's Werther in 1958, she won praise as Sophie. At the age of 21, she won the Kathleen Ferrier Memorial Scholarship and spent a year in Milan studying with Lina Pagliughi. She was later a joint winner of the international Verdi competition in Busseto.\n Passage 2:Welcome to Hell influenced several later bands. Venom's music helped shape the development of many thrash metal bands, specifically the \"Big Four of Thrash\" (who in turn were highly influential): Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax, and Megadeth (Metallica opened for Venom on an early 1980s tour, and Venom opened for Metallica and Slayer on the Ride the Lightning tour, and Slayer played with them and Exodus on the Combat Tour in 1985). Venom would also be of extreme importance to the black metal scene and even the early death metal scene, with numerous bands copying styles, themes, and imagery from the band, such as the Swiss band Hellhammer (later to become Celtic Frost), whom also helped pioneer the genres. Music critic Bradley Torreano wrote that Venom \"caught the attention of both metalheads and punks, the band was emulated by the former and turned into camp icons by the latter.\" Henry Rollins once compared the band to Spinal Tap.\n Passage 3:Duncan was born in Lebanon, Tennessee. His \"paternal grandparents were small-areage farmers in Scott County, which in 1861 left Tennessee, refusing to follow the Volunteer State into the Confederacy, and declared itself 'the Free and Independent state of Scott.'\" Duncan's parents were Lois (Swisher) and John Duncan Sr., who \"hitchhiked into Knoxville with five dollars in his pocket,' and after an education at the University of Tennessee was elected mayor of Knoxville and then congressman.\" The elder Duncan was also a co-owner of the Knoxville Smokies of the \"Sally League,\" for which his son \"was a batboy, a ball shagger, scoreboard operator, and, as a freshman at the University of Tennessee, the Smokies' public-address announcer.\" Duncan also worked as a grocery bagger and salesman at Sears while working his way through school.

Passage 1:Persoonia terminalis was first reported by Lawrie Johnson of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney, in the 1981 edition of Flora of New South Wales. He viewed it as a distinctive subspecies of Persoonia nutans, a broadly defined species that included many forms since classified as distinct. Queensland botanists Trevor Donald Stanley and Estelle M. Ross classed P.terminalis as part of Persoonia oxycoccoides in their 1983 work Flora of South-eastern Queensland. They considered it more likely a species in its own right, as they believed the description of the Queensland populations did not match the P. oxycoccoides from central New South Wales. Upon re-examining Persoonia nutans and Persoonia oxycoccoides, Johnson and Peter Weston concluded that there were in fact several distinct species, and that Persoonia terminalis was described as such in 1991. The type specimen was collected south of the Torrington pub on the Emmaville\u2013Torrington road by Weston and ecologist Peter Richards, and is now housed in the National Herbarium of New South Wales, which is part of the Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust Sydney and Office of Environment and Heritage. The Herbarium houses over 1.2million other specimens. The generic name Persoonia is derived from the name of South African botanist Christiaan Hendrik Persoon. The specific name terminalis refers to the inflorescences (clusters of flowers) that are in this species at the ends of the branchlets. Its common name is the Torrington geebung.\n Passage 2:Burn made his debut in County Cricket for Durham in the 1985 Minor Counties Championship against Cumberland. From 1985 to 1991, he represented the county in 40 Championship matches, the last of which came against Cambridgeshire. Burn also represented Durham in the MCCA Knockout Trophy, making his debut in that competition against Hertfordshire in 1986. From 1986 to 1991, he played 6 Trophy matches for the county, the last of which came against Cumberland. It was for Durham that Burn made his debut in List A cricket against Derbyshire in the 1985 NatWest Trophy. From 1985 to 1991, he represented the county in 6 List A matches, the last of which came against Glamorgan in the 1991 NatWest Trophy. Following Durham's elevation to first-class status at the end of the 1991 season, Burn played no further matches for the county.\n Passage 3:After rejecting an invitation for a one-year guest professorship by the University of California, Berkeley, Stourzh returned to Vienna in 1958 to organize the newly created Austrian Association for Foreign Policy and International Relations; he was its general secretary until 1962. In 1962, Stourzh passed his habilitation and became Docent for Modern History at the University of Vienna. In the same year, upon a suggestion by Bruno Kreisky, he entered Austria's Federal Ministry for European and International Affairs, where he had the desk of the Council of Europe. In 1963, he received a call from the Free University of Berlin to become a professor of Modern History, especially American history, and to head, at the same time, the section for American history at the newly founded John F. Kennedy-Institute for North American Studies of that University. He accepted the call and remained at the Free University until 1969, with an interruption due to a research stay at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton. In 1969, he became professor for Modern History at the University of Vienna, succeeding Friedrich Engel-Janosi.

Passage 1:Donegan was born on 13 July 1961 in Stirling, and educated at St Modan's High School in Stirling and at the University of Glasgow, where his musical career began. He was the bassist in The Bluebells, whose biggest hit was \"Young at Heart\", and Lloyd Cole and the Commotions. After the latter group split, Donegan became a journalist and an author. Between these roles, he worked as the House of Commons assistant to Brian Wilson MP. Whilst in that role, he was part of a one-off band called the Stop Its that recorded an anti-poll tax song of a similar name. The band also included David Hill, later press spokesman for Tony Blair. and Tim Luckhurst, who later became editor of The Scotsman newspaper, and is Professor of Journalism at the University of Kent. In the late 1980s, Donegan made a number of appearances with South London football team Belair Casuals FC. He is now a golf journalist for The Guardian, having previously worked at The Scotsman. He has held a post with the former publication since 2004, although he has been at the newspaper since 1994, as a general reporter and then as the Scotland correspondent from 1997 to 2004. During the 2010 Winter Olympics, Donegan gained notoriety for his overly critical reviews of the games. Journalists believed that his harsh reviews and similar critiques coming from the British media were made as an attempt to make the games look bad as the following Olympics would be held in London. In 2012, The Guardian made a tongue-in-cheek reference to the severe criticism of the prior Games by inviting a Canadian journalist to similarly critique the Summer Olympics in London as the 'worst ever'.\n Passage 2:Born in Urbino, he studied at Padua and at Ferrara, where he received his doctorate in medicine. He was most famous for his central role as translator of works of ancient mathematicians. In this, his sources were primarily written in Greek and secondarily in Arabic, while his translations were primarily in Latin and secondarily in Italian. He was responsible for the publication of many treatises of Archimedes. He also translated the works of Aristarchus of Samos (On the sizes and distances of the Sun and the Moon), Pappus of Alexandria (Mathematical collection), Hero of Alexandria (Pneumatics), Ptolemy of Alexandria (Planisphere and Analemma), Apollonius of Perga (Conics) and Euclid of Alexandria (Elements). Among his pupils was Guidobaldo del Monte and Bernardino Baldi. Commandino maintained a correspondence with the astronomer Francesco Maurolico. The proposition known as Commandino's theorem first appears in his work on centers of gravity.\n Passage 3:In 1787, Swedish part-time chemist Carl Axel Arrhenius found a heavy black rock near the Swedish village of Ytterby, Sweden (part of the Stockholm Archipelago). Thinking that it was an unknown mineral containing the newly discovered element tungsten, he named it ytterbite. Finnish scientist Johan Gadolin identified a new oxide or \"earth\" in Arrhenius' sample in 1789, and published his completed analysis in 1794; in 1797, the new oxide was named yttria. In the decades after French scientist Antoine Lavoisier developed the first modern definition of chemical elements, it was believed that earths could be reduced to their elements, meaning that the discovery of a new earth was equivalent to the discovery of the element within, which in this case would have been yttrium. Until the early 1920s, the chemical symbol \"Yt\" was used for the element, after which \"Y\" came into common use. Yttrium metal was first isolated in 1828 when Friedrich W\u00f6hler heated anhydrous yttrium(III) chloride with potassium to form metallic yttrium and potassium chloride.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:Growing up in Pingelly in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia, Winmar began his career with South Fremantle, playing 58 games at the club before being recruited prior to the 1987 season by St Kilda. In a twelve-season career with St Kilda, Winmar won the club's best and fairest award, the Trevor Barker Award, in 1989 and 1995 and was also twice named in the All-Australian team. He left St Kilda at the end of the 1998 season and was drafted by the Western Bulldogs, playing one further season in the AFL before retiring at the end of the 1999 season. Having represented Western Australia in eight interstate matches, Winmar was named in St Kilda's in 2003 and was inducted into the West Australian Football Hall of Fame in 2009. An Indigenous Australian, he was the first Aboriginal footballer to play 200 games in the AFL and was named in the Indigenous Team of the Century in 2005. He was involved in several incidents of racial vilification during his career and a photograph of Winmar responding to one such incident during the 1993 season has been described as one of the most memorable images in Australian sporting history.\n Passage 2:The Bombay Presidency was created when the city of Bombay was leased in fee tail to the East India Company by a Royal Charter from the King of England, Charles II, who had in turn acquired it on May 11, 1661, when his marriage treaty with Catherine of Braganza, daughter of King John IV of Portugal, placed the islands of Bombay in possession of the English Empire, as part of Catherine's dowry to Charles. The English East India Company transferred its Western India headquarters from Surat, its first colony in that region, to Bombay in 1687. The Presidency was brought under British Parliament control along with other parts of British India through Pitt's India Act. Major territorial acquisitions were made during the Anglo-Maratha Wars when the whole of the Peshwa's dominions and much of the Gaekwad's sphere of influence were annexed to the Bombay Presidency in different stages till 1818. Aden was annexed in 1839, while Sind was annexed by the Company in 1843 after defeating the Talpur dynasty in the Battle of Hyderabad and it was made a part of the Bombay Presidency.\n Passage 3:In 1979 Williams won his first British National Hill Climb Championships setting a new course record that still stands to this day. A rival, Andy Hitchens, who remembers it well, said: \"Williams looked like he'd been on starvation rations for months \u2014 he was built like a sparrow. Some people assume that there was a howling tailwind that day, but there wasn't. It was sunny, but cool.\u201d In 1980 Williams joined the Manchester Wheelers' Club and was expected to win International honours during the next two or three seasons. Later that year he won his first stage in the Sealink International finishing four minutes clear. However Williams was left disappointed in the National Hill Climb Championships that year beaten into second place by Malcolm Elliott by only one fifth of a second after being knocked off his bike whilst warming up and receiving a broken nose and severe bruising. At the age of 21 Williams competed for Great Britain in the individual road race at the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games. He was sponsored by Harry Hall Cycles. Williams finished 47th, alongside Stephen Roche. At the end of the 1980 season Williams publicly declared his intention of living and racing in France for the 1981 racing calendar with a view to turning professional therefore joining the French club ACBB (Athletic Club de Boulogne Billencourt), Europe\u2019s most successful sports club.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:Stevens grew up in Sydney and was an accountant and public servant before entering politics. He was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly at the 1927 state election, as a member of the Nationalist Party. In 1929, he was appointed state treasurer under Thomas Bavin, serving until his party lost the 1930 election. In 1932, Stevens was elected as the inaugural leader of the state branch of the UAP. He became premier later that year, following the dismissal of Labor's Jack Lang, and subsequently led his party to victory at the 1932, 1935, and 1938 elections. Stevens was ousted in 1939 and replaced by Alexander Mair. He made an abortive attempt to enter federal politics at the 1940 election, and thereafter played little part in public life.\n Passage 2:McKellar twice served as President pro tempore of the United States Senate, commencing in 1945, the first to hold the position under the system that has prevailed since of reserving it for the most senior member of the majority party. When Harry Truman became president in April 1945, upon FDR's death, the vice presidency became vacant (the mechanism for filling intra-term vacancies had not yet been created by the 25th Amendment), and so McKellar became the permanent presiding officer of the United States Senate. Also, as the President pro tempore of the Senate had, prior to 1886, been second in the presidential line of succession, behind only the vice president, Truman viewed McKellar as the logical wartime replacement for himself, and asked McKellar to attend all Cabinet meetings. In 1947 Truman successfully lobbied Congress to pass a new Presidential Succession Act restoring both the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate to the succession ahead of the Cabinet secretaries. By the time the law came into effect, McKellar was no longer in the position of President pro tempore, because Republicans held the majority in the 80th Congress. Truman vetoed the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947 to restrict labor unions, which McKellar voted in favor of. As such Truman selected Alben Barkley of Kentucky as his running mate in the 1948 presidential election. When Democrats regained control as a result of the 1948 elections, McKellar again became President pro tempore. He was therefore second in line for the presidency (behind the Speaker of the House) from January 3, 1949 until January 20, 1949, when Alben Barkley took office as Vice President of the United States.\n Passage 3:The season featured nine tropical cyclones, of which eight further intensified into tropical storms and six further intensified into hurricanes (including two major hurricanes). Impact throughout the year was widespread. In early July, Hurricane Arthur moved ashore near Cape Lookout, North Carolina, resulting in minor damage and one indirect death. In August, hurricanes Bertha and Cristobal moved across the southwestern Atlantic, causing minimal damage and several fatalities. In September, Tropical Storm Dolly moved ashore the coastline of eastern Mexico, killing one and inflicting unsubstantial damage, while Hurricane Edouard created large swells that impacted the East Coast of the United States and killed two people. In October, hurricanes Fay and Gonzalo moved ashore Bermuda, marking the first time more than one tropical cyclone made landfall on the island in a single season on record.

He became that newspaper's editor in 1897, succeeding Charles Anderson Dana. Mitchell was recognized as a major figure in the early development of the science fiction genre. Mitchell wrote fiction about a man rendered invisible by scientific means (\"The Crystal Man\", published in 1881) before H.G. Wells's The Invisible Man, wrote about a time-travel machine (\"The Clock that Went Backward\") before Wells's The Time Machine, wrote about faster-than-light travel (\"The Tachypomp\"; now perhaps his best-known work) in 1874, a thinking computer and a cyborg in 1879 (\"The Ablest Man in the World\"), and also wrote the earliest known stories about matter transmission or teleportation (\"The Man without a Body\", 1877) and a superior mutant (\"Old Squids and Little Speller\"). \"Exchanging Their Souls\" (1877) is one of the earliest fictional accounts of mind transfer. Mitchell retired in 1926, a year before dying of a cerebral hemorrhage.\n Passage 2:As a gymnasium student in Riga and a law student at the University of St. Petersburg, Smolskis joined the Lithuanian National Revival and started contributing his poetry and articles to Lithuanian periodicals, including \u016akininkas and T\u0117vyn\u0117s sargas.

Smolskis joined the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party (LSDP) and was a delegate at the Great Seimas of Vilnius. He was an active organizer of anti-Tsarist protests in the Roki\u0161kis District during the Russian Revolution of 1905. In retaliation, Russian soldiers shot four cannonballs into his parents' house in Kamajai. Smolskis escaped to Switzerland, but soon returned to Lithuania and continue working with LSDP in Vilnius. He was searched by the police and decided to escape to Crimea. He was arrested in Simferopol but managed to escape in summer 1907. He briefly lived in the Austrian Empire, Italy, and Switzerland before starting studies at the New University of Brussels in 1910. After graduation in late 1913, he returned to the Russian Empire and rejoined socialist activities. He was again arrested and imprisoned in May 1916 but was freed after the February Revolution.

Denniston Jr saw service in various capacities, including the civil service and that of the Bank of New South Wales, and then became a law student with William Downie Stewart. He was admitted to the New Zealand Bar at Dunedin by Justice Chapman on 4 August 1874. For some months he practised at Wanganui in partnership with George Hutchison, afterwards a prominent member of the House of Representatives. In 1875, he became associated with Downie Stewart in Dunedin and the firm was subsequently joined by Allan Holmes, son of the Hon. Mathew Holmes, MLC, under the style of Stewart, Holmes and Denniston, and acquired an extensive practice in Otago. Court work was undertaken by Denniston, whose name was connected with most of the important civil and criminal cases in the province.

It was probably first seen on November 23, 1935, by Lincoln Ellsworth, who flew directly over the glacier and obtained photos of features north and south of it. The mouth of the glacier was observed and positioned by the British Graham Land Expedition in 1936 and the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS) in 1948 and 1949. The glacier was mapped in detail from air photos taken by the Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition, 1947\u201348, by D. Searle of the FIDS in 1960.

Rosberg claimed the win in Germany, while Hamilton recovered to third after an accident in qualifying saw him start from twentieth place. Hamilton finished third in Hungary after starting from pit lane, ahead of Rosberg.

Its history is commonly divided into four sections as first organized by Eugene England. During the first fifty years of the church's existence, 1830\u20131880, fiction was not popular, though Parley P. Pratt wrote a fictional Dialogue between Joseph Smith and the Devil. With the emergence of the novel and short stories as popular reading material, Orson F. Whitney called on fellow members to write inspirational stories. During the home literature movement, church-published magazines published many didactic stories and Nephi Anderson wrote the novel Added Upon. The generation of writers after the home literature movement produced fiction that was recognized nationally but was seen as rebelling against home literature's outward moralization. Vardis Fisher's Children of God and Maurine Whipple's The Giant Joshua were prominent novels from this time period. In the 1970s and 1980s, authors starting writing realistic fiction as faithful Mormons. Acclaimed examples include Levi S. Peterson's The Backslider and Linda Sillitoe's Sideways to the Sun. Home literature experienced a resurgence in popularity in the 1980s and 1990s when church-owned Deseret Book started to publish more fiction, including Gerald Lund's historical fiction series The Work and the Glory and Jack Weyland's novels.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:West Suffield Mountain, like much of the Metacomet Ridge, is composed of basalt, also called traprock, a volcanic rock. The mountain formed near the end of the Triassic Period with the rifting apart of the North American continent from Africa and Eurasia. Lava welled up from the rift and solidified into sheets of strata hundreds of feet thick. Subsequent faulting and earthquake activity tilted the strata, creating the cliffs and ridgeline of West Suffield Mountain. Hot, dry upper slopes, cool, moist ravines, and mineral-rich ledges of basalt talus produce a combination of microclimate ecosystems on the mountain that support plant and animal species uncommon in greater Connecticut.

Heerman directed a screen test featuring Seymour and one of D.W. Griffith's Artcraft stock company actors Robert Harron. Griffith was pleased with the pairing and with Seymour's knack for light comedy and hired her as member of his stock company. Griffith cast Seymour with Harron, Richard Barthelmess and Carol Dempster in the drama The Girl Who Stayed at Home (1919). Although the film was not well received by critics, Seymour's performance was and the public interest in her began to grow. Later that year, she was paired with Robert Harron again in True Heart Susie (1919) which also featured Lillian Gish. Seymour followed with role in Scarlet Days (1919), also opposite Richard Barthelmess and Carol Dempster. In 1920, Griffith cast Seymour in the lead role in The Idol Dancer. The film was not well received by audiences but they were taken by Seymour's performance. Shortly after the film's release, Seymour was featured on the cover of Motion Picture Magazine.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

In 1915, he was sent to Japan to acquire weapons for the revolutionaries. According to British intelligence reports, he was active in the Hindu\u2013German conspiracy. In September 1915, while on his return journey to India, he was arrested in Singapore and incarcerated at the Fort Canning prison there, where he remained until he escaped in the autumn of 1917. The exact details of his escape are unclear. Mukherji managed to reach Java in the Dutch East Indies, where he stayed until the end of 1919, living under the name of Dar Shaheer. In Java, he was in contact with Indonesian and Dutch revolutionaries and became a communist. He also travelled to Amsterdam and back. In Amsterdam, he met S.J.

Passage 1:Although the UKST was originally used to take photographs of the sky, traditional photographic glass (and film) became largely superseded by large electronic CCD detectors in the late 1990s, and after 2000 the UKST was used mostly for multi-object spectroscopy with the 6 degree Field (6dF) instrument. 6dF uses a robot to position up to 150 optical fibres on a metal plate mounted at the focal plane of the UKST, which then carry light from the targets to a spectrograph which sits on the floor of the dome. The 6dF Galaxy Survey (6dFGS), a redshift survey of 120,000 infrared-selected galaxies was completed in 2005, and from 2003\u20132013 the UKST then carried out the RAdial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) to measure the radial velocities and metallicities of around to 0.5\u00a0million stars in the Milky Way Galaxy.\n Passage 2:Green was selected by the Baltimore Ravens in the 5th round (158th overall) in the 2005 NFL Draft. He was utilized mostly as a blocking fullback in 2005 by the Baltimore Ravens. His solid play was rewarded with 4 starts and 12 games played in his rookie campaign. Green played in both the Ravens Monday Night Football games in 2005, and started one of them. His game worn jersey from the Monday Night game with Green Bay was auctioned on eBay and sold for a few hundred dollars. Green also played on special teams.

Ranald's father, Somerled was styled \"King of the Hebrides\", and was killed campaigning against Malcolm IV of Scotland at the Battle of Renfrew in 1164. Clan Donald shares a descent from Somerled with Clan MacDougall, who traces their lineage from his elder son, Dugall mac Somhairle. Their dynasties are together commonly referred to as the Clann Somhairle. Furthermore, they are descended maternally from both the House of Godred Crovan and the Earls of Orkney, through Somerled's wife Ragnhildis \u00d3lafsd\u00f3ttir, daughter of Olaf I Godredsson, King of Mann and the Isles and Ingeborg Haakonsdottir daughter of Haakon Paulsson, Earl of Orkney.

Passage 1:Of those Phillies, 97 have had surnames beginning with the letter R. Two of those players have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame: pitcher Eppa Rixey, who was a Phillie for six seasons in two different stints (1912\u20131917, 1919); and Robin Roberts, who won 20 games during the 1950 season as the ace pitcher of the Whiz Kids. The Hall of Fame lists the Phillies as Roberts' primary team; during his career, the right-hander won 234 games and lost 199, the latter one of his three franchise records. During his 14 seasons with the team, he pitched 3,739\u2009 innings and completed 272 games, both records; he also held the major league record for most career home runs allowed until it was broken in 2010. Roberts was also elected to the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame as the Phillies' first inductee in 1978.\n Passage 2:Through his involvement with the Design and Industries Association Holden met Frank Pick, general manager of the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL). Holden at the time had no experience in designing for transport, but this would change through his collaboration with Pick. In 1923, Pick commissioned Holden to design a fa\u00e7ade for a side entrance at Westminster Underground station. This was followed in 1924 with an appointment to design the UERL's pavilion for the British Empire Exhibition. Also in 1924, Pick commissioned Holden to design seven new stations in south London for the extension of the City and South London Railway (now part of the Northern line) from Clapham Common to Morden. The designs replaced a set by the UERL's own architect, Stanley Heaps, which Pick had found unsatisfactory. The designs reflect the simple modernist style he was using in France for the war cemeteries; double-height ticket halls are clad in plain Portland stone framing a glazed screen, each adapted to suit the street corner sites of most of the stations. The screens feature the Underground roundel made up in coloured glass panels and are divided by stone columns surmounted by capitals formed as a three-dimensional version of the roundel. Holden also advised Heaps on new fa\u00e7ades for a number of the existing stations on the line and produced the design for a new entrance at Bond Street station on the Central London Railway.\n Passage 3:Williams started his footballing career at his local club Cradley Town in 1990. After impressing in the lower leagues he attracted the attention of Football League sides and joined Welsh side Swansea City in 1991. After having a decent season with Swansea he move on up to Coventry City the following season. He spent three years with the sky blues making 80 league appearances, the most he would acquire in his career. Williams' early goal against Middlesbrough on 15 August 1992 was only the second goal ever scored in the newly formed FA Premiership (the goal came in the ninth minute of the game which was approximately four minutes after Brian Deane's goal against Manchester United on the opening day of the new season). Whilst at Coventry Williams had loan spells at Notts County, Stoke City and at his old club Swansea City. He left Coventry in 1995 and joined new league side Wycombe Wanderers to start a somewhat nomadic career. After two years with the chairboys he moved on to unsuccessful spells at Hereford United and Walsall. Williams then went on to have a new club every season starting with Exeter City in the 1997\u201398 season. He went on to play for Cardiff City, York City, Darlington, two seasons with Swansea City his third spell at the club and his final Football League side Kidderminster Harriers.

His final matches as an active wrestler took place in Winnipeg's West Four Wrestling Alliance on February 25, 1992, defeating \"Bulldog\" Bob Brown, Bob Ryan and Randy Rudd in singles matches, teaming with Chris Jericho and Lance Storm to battle Brown, The Natural and Gerry Morrow to a no-contest in a six-man match, and being the last man eliminated by Morrow in a battle royal to fill the vacant WFWA Canadian Heavyweight Championship at a WFWA TV taping in Winnipeg. He acted as the cornerman for Dory Funk Jr. in a match between Funk and Nick Bockwinkel (with Verne Gagne) at Slamboree 1993. He was inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame in 1996, and into the Tragos/Thesz Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in Newton, Iowa in 2004. In 2000, he was the interim president (commissioner) of All Japan Pro Wrestling's Pacific Wrestling Federation title governing body, but only while they searched for a permanent replacement for Lord James Blears and to present the vacant Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship to the winner of a tournament.

The third-line up of the band, consisting of Buchanan, Range and Amelle Berrabah, performed \"Caught in a Moment\" at the Sheffield City Hall in March 2006 as part of their tour in support of Taller in More Ways (2005). According to Dave Simpson of The Guardian, the performance suggested that Berrabah \"could trigger an unlikely shift into soul\" for the group. The trio performed \"Caught in a Moment\" at the 100 Club, London on 3 October 2006 as part of a gig, which was in promotion of Overloaded: The Singles Collection. They performed the song as part of the Overloaded tour, and were seated on stools in the centre of the stage. With regard to their performance on 13 April 2007 at the Wembley Arena, London, Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy commented: \"Their epiphanic beauty was fully realised with the fragile, emotive nature of Heidi's voice and Keisha's powerful singing\". \"Caught in a Moment\" appeared in the set list for the group's 2008 Change Tour. According to The Journals Kat Keogh, their performance at the Newcastle City Hall \"displayed a confident shift from moody pop princesses to sassy Supremes-style harmony\".\n Passage 3:On April Fools' Day 2019, TheJournal.ie published a report on Prime Minister Theresa May's scheduled appearance on that night's special live episode of EastEnders, details of which had been leaked by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar overnight. May's purpose was to issue a final plea for unity as Brexit entered a critical stage. The internet publication featured a photograph of May in The Queen Victoria pub, with the caption \"Rehearsal shot of hostile locals witnessing May's arrival\". It even went so far as to compose fake documents to back up its claim, including a draft script said to have been provided by the BBC to highlight the ever-changing difficulties of keeping up with political events as they rapidly unfolded: \"'This is the 416th draft' the source said. 'And her appearance was only confirmed at the start of March. Brexit won't stop f*****g, c*****g changing every two seconds. It's driving the actors mad.'\" A short video clip shows actor Adam Woodyatt (who portrays the character of Ian Beale) being comforted by colleague Steve McFadden (who portrays the character Phil Mitchell), as Woodyatt bursts into tears due to the protracted rehearsals. The preliminary script \u2014 which, TheJournal.ie reminded readers, was \"contingent on what the hell happens in Brexit over the course of today\" \u2014 had Dot Cotton (played by June Brown) gasping as Theresa May enters the pub. May, having begun her speech, is interrupted by Mick Carter (played by Danny Dyer) who knocks over a pint and a chair in his efforts to have the Prime Minister leave the pub. May departs and perches herself despondently on a park bench, whereupon Kat Slater (played by Jessie Wallace) approaches her with \"Alright love? What's getting you down?\" May tells Slater she has already blamed everyone \u2014 the Irish, the Democratic Unionist Party, the European Union \u2014 and is at a loss for who is left for her to find fault with now. Slater advises her to be honest. May finds solace in this, thanks Slater, remarks on the chilliness of the night and Slater hands the Prime Minister her leopard print jacket to put on.

Passage 1:On December 12, 2008, the Capitals were preparing to host the Ottawa Senators. During the morning skate, Jos\u00e9 Th\u00e9odore suffered a hip flexor injury, forcing the Capitals to recall Semyon Varlamov from their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Hershey Bears. However, Varlamov was with the Bears in San Antonio, Texas and was unable to make it to Washington in time to start the game as the backup goaltender. As a result, the Capitals were forced to dress three goaltenders, signing Leonhardt, the team's website producer, to an amateur tryout contract before the game to back up Brent Johnson until the arrival of Varlamov. Because of his experience in NCAA Division III ice hockey with the State University of New York at Oswego and Neumann College, as well as the Kitchener Dutchmen of the GOJHL, Leonhardt had previously participated in on-ice practice sessions with the Capitals, filling in when an additional goaltender was needed. Varlamov arrived 9:03 into the first period and replaced Leonhardt as Johnson's backup for the remainder of the game. Had Leonhardt played in the game, he would have tied Ben Bishop as the tallest goalie in NHL history. He did not receive any pay for his contract. These bizarre circumstances were remarkably similar to those the Vancouver Canucks faced on December 9, 2003, when starting goaltender Dan Cloutier suffered a groin injury during the morning skate, forcing the Canucks to sign University of British Columbia goaltender Chris Levesque to an amateur tryout contract.\n Passage 2:UK disc jockeys Trevor Fung, Paul Oakenfold, and Danny Rampling are commonly credited with having \"popularized\" Balearic beat, specially in the UK. In 1987, after a holiday in Ibiza, Oakenfold and his friends Trevor Fung and Ian St. Paul returned to London, where they unsuccessfully tried to establish a nightclub called the Funhouse in the Balearic style. Returning to Ibiza during the summer of 1987, Oakenfold rented a villa where he hosted a number of his DJ friends, including Danny Rampling, Johnny Walker, and Nicky Holloway. Returning to London after the summer, Oakenfold reintroduced the Balearic style at a South London nightclub called the Project Club. The club initially attracted those who had visited Ibiza and who were familiar with the Balearic concept. Fueled by their use of Ecstasy and an emerging fashion style based on baggy clothes and bright colors, these Ibiza veterans were responsible for propagating the Balearic subculture within the evolving UK rave scene. In 1988, Oakenfold established a second outlet for Balearic beat, a Monday night event called Spectrum, which is credited with exposing the Balearic concept to a wider audience. It was 1988 when Balearic beat was first noticed in the U.S., according to Dance Music Report magazine. Jose Padilla, is an Ibizan DJ best known for his residency at Caf\u00e9 del Mar. Also Jon Sa Trinxa, a british DJ and Producer best known for the longest residency on Salinas Beach at Sa Trinxa defines his style as being Balearic Music.\n Passage 3:Eddings was the home plate umpire for Game 2 of the 2005 ALCS between the White Sox and the Angels. White Sox batter A. J. Pierzynski quickly got two strikes and then swung at the third pitch, a splitter which came in very low. Angels catcher Josh Paul caught the ball so \"thought the inning was over.\" Not hearing himself called out, Pierzynski took a couple of steps toward the dugout, then turned and ran to first base while most of the Angels were walking off the field. Eddings ruled that the ball had not been legally caught (an uncaught third strike), but made no audible call that the ball hit the ground. Joe Buck and Tim McCarver, announcing the game on Fox and reviewing replays of the pitch, felt the ball had clearly been caught; note that MLB did not adopt review via instant replay until the season. A pinch runner for Pierzynski subsequently scored the winning run of the game for the White Sox. According to umpire supervisor Rich Rieker, the replays showed \"there was definitely a change in direction there\" indicating the ball touched the ground and felt, at best, the replay was inconclusive. After the game, Eddings said he would adjust his umpiring style to clarify a third strike call from calling the batter out.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Early releases included- \"I'm Glad She's Mine,\" \"I Don't Need Your Help,\" \"Will You Go Steady,\" \"Take Me Back,\" among others. The group's greatest success as \"The American Breed\" was the single, \"Bend Me, Shape Me\", which reached number five on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1968. The song, written by Scott English and Larry Weiss, had previously been recorded by an all-female band known as the Shape and had been a hit on the UK Singles Chart for the British group Amen Corner. It had also been recorded by The Outsiders after they had reached the top ten with \"Time Won't Let Me\" in 1966. Contributing to the success of the American Breed's version of \"Bend Me, Shape Me\" was the excellent arrangement of the song by the band's record producer, Bill Traut, who added horns among other changes.

They become great friends and Drupada assures Drona that once he becomes king, he will share half of his kingdom with Drona. While Drupada becomes a king after the death of his father, Drona lives a life of poverty. Drona approaches Drupada for help; Drupada, now conscious of the difference of status between them, refuses to acknowledge Drona's friendship and shuns Drona, calling him a beggar. Drona is later employed by Bhishma to train the Kuru princes. After the military education of the Kauravas and the Pandavas ends, as his gurudakshina, Drona asks the princes to defeat and capture Drupada. Firstly, all the Kauravas, along with Karna, attack Drupada, but Drupada defeats all of them. Then the Pandavas led by Arjuna defeat Drupada, binding him in ropes and bringing him to Drona. Drona sets Drupada free, but retains half of the kingdom that had been promised to him. Humiliated, Drupada seeks vengeance but he realizes that he cannot match Drona's might. So, Drupada performed the Putrakameshti yajna to beget a son who could slay Drona. From the fire of the yajna, twins Dhrishtadyumna and Draupadi are born. Years later, Draupadi married Arjuna and later in the Mahabharata war, Dhrishtadyumna beheaded Drona.\n Passage 3:Born in Densmore, Kansas, Archer moved to Topeka, Kansas where he attended public high school.

He later served on Greenland whalers, but in 1795 was seized by a press gang at Wapping and forcibly recruited into the Royal Navy. Due a superior education (although where he obtained this education is unknown), Bartholomew was rapidly promoted to midshipman, serving in numerous theatres and becoming a favourite of Admiral Sir Home Riggs Popham. Bartholomew was present at the surrender of the Dutch fleet in 1799, on HMS Romney in the East Indies and in 1802 was in charge of the ship's chronometers during a voyage to the Red Sea. The Peace of Amiens in the same year saw a reduction in the Navy and Bartholomew was placed in reserve.\n Passage 3:The idea of a national cathedral first emerged following the Romanian War of Independence (1877\u20131878), which was mainly fought between the Russian and Ottoman Empires. The church was to symbolise the victory of Orthodox Christians over the Ottoman Muslims. The idea was shelved for lack of consensus on design, location and funding. The Unification of the Romanian Principalities in 1859, entailed a unitary organization of church structures in Moldavia and Wallachia within the Holy Synod (1872), thus the assembly of hierarchs increased to 12 members, including: the Primate Metropolitan (chairman), the Metropolitan of Moldavia and their suffragan bishops of R\u00e2mnic, Buz\u0103u, Arge\u0219, Roman, Hu\u0219i and Lower Danube (Gala\u021bi) and one auxiliary vicar-bishop for every diocese. The old Metropolitan Cathedral had proved overcrowded, especially during the national holidays, such as the Proclamation of the Kingdom of Romania and the crowning of the First King Carol I (10 May 1881), when none of the over one hundred churches in Bucharest were able to receive those who would have wanted to participate in the official service. Therefore, at King Carol I's desire, Romania's Assembly of Deputies and the Senate voted in favour of the Law no.1750 on the construction of the Cathedral Church in Bucharest, promulgated by King Carol I on 5 June 1884.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

In 1417 he was possibly sent on a diplomatic mission to the Venetians in the Morea. In 1422 and again in 1429 he was sent by Emperor John VIII Palaiologos as an envoy to the Ottoman Sultan Murad II. At the time he had the relatively lowly rank of protovestiarites, but was quickly promoted to protostrator and then to the senior rank of megas stratopedarches, which he held already during his mission in 1430 to Pope Martin V.

The station was relocated on the western side of the original station, with an enlarged island platform and rebuilt, in 1898-9, in red brick, with a turreted clock tower and mock Tudor frontage. A further platform was constructed for the Hooton line, on the eastern side of the original station. The site of the original station was used for goods sidings.

Saddam Hussein considered the group as 'Iranians' and began a campaign to drive the settlers out of the area as a part of his 'Arabization' policy in 1980., Saddam Hussein was severely critical of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) as they aligned forces with Iran in the conflict. In 1983, to avenge this liaison, he ordered the Army to abduct as many as 8,000 men and boys from Erbil province, where the clan of Barzani Kurds was based. Massoud Barzani, the leader of the clan and the KDP, himself lost 37 members of his family to the Iraqi troops.

T. Joshi's Black Wings series, Matt Cardin's Teeming Brain website and his book Horror Literature Through History, Animal Magnetism, and so on). A content expert in multiple areas, he has been a frequent special guest and panelist at many horror and science fiction conventions (such as Necronomicon-Providence, MythosCon, Norwescon, Crypticon, World Horror Convention, World Fantasy Convention, and others) and film festivals (including the H.

The previous record was 63, originally set by Tom Dempsey (1970) and then matched by Jason Elam (1998), Sebastian Janikowski (2011), David Akers (2012), Graham Gano (2018), and Brett Maher (2019). The record in the CFL is 62 yards, set by Paul McCallum on October 27, 2001. High school, college and most professional football leagues offer only a three-point field goal; however, some professional leagues have encouraged more rare kicks through four-point field goals. NFL Europe encouraged long field goals of 50 yards or more by making those worth four points instead of three (much like Australian rules' Super Goal or basketball's three-point line), a rule since adopted by the Stars Football League. Similarly, the sport of arena football sought (unsuccessfully) to repopularize the drop kick by making that worth four points; it failed, since only one kicker (Brian Mitchell) was able to do it with any semblance of proficiency. (In six-man football, where there is no offensive line, all field goals are worth four points instead of the usual three.)\n Passage 3:Merion Estes (born Salt Lake City, Utah on September 5, 1938) is a Los Angeles-based painter.

A section of the Harbiyya district of the Round city of Baghdad was named Marwr\u016bdiyya () after the people from this city. The town continued to flourish under the Seljuk Empire, when the Seljuk ruler Ahmad Sanjar built the city a new wall, some 5,000 paces in circumference. The town and the surrounding area suffered during the constant conflicts between the Khwarazmshahs and the Ghurids in the late 12th century, and a battle was fought there between the Ghurid ruler Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad (r. 1163\u20131202) and his Khwarazmian rival Sultan Shah (r. 1172\u20131193) in 1190.

Sierra Leone returned to a democratically elected government when the military Junta under Brigadier General Julius Maada Bio who had ousted Strasser in a coup in 1996, handed the presidency to Ahmad Tejan Kabbah of the SLPP after his victory in the 1996 Sierra Leone presidential election. However, on 25 May 1997, the Sierra Leone military overthrew President Kabbah in a coup and Major General Johnny Paul Koroma became the country's Head of State.

From 1949, it evolved into conventional warfare, due largely to aid from the communists of the People's Republic of China (\"PRC\") to the north. Subsequently, the French strategy of occupying small, poorly defended outposts throughout Indochina, particularly along the Vietnamese-Chinese border, started failing. Thanks to the terrain, popular support for August Revolution and support for decolonization from bordering China and the U.S.S.R., the Viet Minh had succeeded in turning a \"clandestine guerrilla movement into a powerful conventional army\", following asymmetric warfare theory laid by Mao Tse Tung, something which previously had never been encountered by the western colonial powers. In October 1952, fighting around the Red River Delta spread into the Thai Highlands, resulting in the Battle of N\u00e0 S\u1ea3n, at which the Viet Minh were defeated. The French used the lessons learned at N\u00e0 S\u1ea3n \u2013 strong ground bases, versatile air support, and a model based on the British Burma Campaign \u2013 as the basis for their new strategy. The Viet Minh, however, remained unbeatable in the highland regions of Vietnam, and the French \"could not offset the fundamental disadvantages of a roadbound army facing a hill and forest army in a country which had few roads but a great many hills and forests\".\n Passage 3:On 31 August 2013, Ki joined Sunderland on a season-long loan with a mid-season re-call option.

It voted Democratic in every presidential election from 1912 to 2004, except for in 1968 (when segregationist George Wallace won the county), and 1972 when many traditional Democratic voters around the nation rejected the perceived radical liberal George McGovern in favor of incumbent Republican Richard Nixon. However, like most of the rural south, Grundy County has shifted towards the Republican Party in recent years, but was one of the last counties in Tennessee to make the switch to the party. The last Democratic Presidential candidate to win Grundy County was John Kerry in 2004, who won 18 out of Tennessee's 95 counties, whereas Al Gore won 36 in 2000.

His publications include: Une Dictature (Le Mans, 1874); Giboyer \u00e0 Saint-P\u00e9lagie (Paris, 1875); L'Evolution des Mondes et des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s (Paris, 1888); Les Trait\u00e9s de Commerce (Tours, 1879); Le Tunnel du Simplon et les Int\u00e9r\u00eats Fran\u00e7ais (Paris, 1879); L'Angleterre, son Gouvernement, ses Institutions (Paris, 1881); La Guerre N\u00e9cessaire, R\u00e9ponse d'un Fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 M. de Bismarck (Paris, 1890). Dreyfus was also secretary and part founder of La Grande Encyclop\u00e9die. He was a member of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur.\n Passage 2:France\u2013United Kingdom relations are the relations between the governments of the French Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK). The historical ties between France and the UK, and the countries preceding them, are long and complex, including conquest, wars, and alliances at various points in history. The Roman era saw both areas, except northern England and Scotland, conquered by Rome, whose fortifications exist in both countries to this day, and whose writing system introduced a common alphabet to both areas; however, the language barrier remained. The Norman conquest of England in 1066 decisively shaped English history, as well as the English language. In the medieval period, the countries were often bitter enemies, with both nations' monarchs claiming control over France. Some of the noteworthy conflicts include the Hundred Years' War and the French Revolutionary Wars which were French victories, and the Seven Years' War, Second Hundred Years\u2019 War and Napoleonic Wars, from which Britain emerged victorious.\n Passage 3:MacDowall was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel of the 57th Regiment of Foot in 1791 and served in Flanders in 1793 and after serving as Commander-in-Chief in Ceylon from 1798 to 1804. In 1802, as a Major-General, he was appointed Colonel commandant of a Battalion of the 40th Regiment of Foot in place of Lord Hutchinson. He was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Madras Army in 1807. He was made Colonel of the 41st Regiment of Foot in 1808. Following a period of dispute with the civil government of Madras over his exclusion from its council, and the affair of the arrest of Quartermaster-General John Munro, he resigned his commission in January 1809 and took ship for England on the East Indiaman Lady Jane Dundas. The ship was lost with all hands near the Cape of Good Hope in March 1809.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

He made his debut for Scotland in June 1992, in a first-class game against Ireland. Later in 1992, and also in 1994, Thomson trialled with English counties, playing Second XI Championship games for Leicestershire and Durham, respectively. At the 1997 ICC Trophy in Malaysia, he played in five of Scotland's nine matches, taking six wickets. His best figures, 3/37 from eight overs, came against Papua New Guinea. Thomson was a regular for Scotland throughout the late 1990s and into the early 2000s, although he missed out on both the team's appearance at the 1999 World Cup and the 2001 ICC Trophy. His final matches for the national team came in the 2003 National Cricket League, against Derbyshire and Lancashire.\n Passage 2:The street has been a main thoroughfare since at least medieval times, and in the Middle Ages was known as \"the road to Reading\" or \"the way from Colnbrook\". Around 1611 or 1612, a Robert Baker acquired land in the area, and prospered by making and selling piccadills. Shortly after purchasing the land, he enclosed it and erected several dwellings, including his home, Pikadilly Hall. What is now Piccadilly was named Portugal Street in 1663 after Catherine of Braganza, wife of Charles II, and grew in importance after the road from Charing Cross to Hyde Park Corner was closed to allow the creation of Green Park in 1668. Some of the most notable stately homes in London were built on the northern side of the street during this period, including Clarendon House and Burlington House in 1664. Berkeley House, constructed around the same time as Clarendon House, was destroyed by a fire in 1733 and rebuilt as Devonshire House in 1737 by William Cavendish, 3rd Duke of Devonshire. It was later used as the main headquarters for the Whig party. Burlington House has since been home to several noted societies, including the Royal Academy of Arts, the Geological Society of London, the Linnean Society, and the Royal Astronomical Society. Several members of the Rothschild family had mansions at the western end of the street. St James's Church was consecrated in 1684 and the surrounding area became St James Parish.\n Passage 3:Born in 1954, Brammer was educated at the Alpha Boys School. After initially working under the name Prince Glen, he began working under the stage name Trinity, taken from the spaghetti western character. After working as a deejay on several Kingston sound systems, he made his debut recording in March 1976 with \"Set Up Yourself\" for producer Joseph Hoo Kim. \"Words of The Prophet\" followed for Yabby You, who also produced his debut album, Shanty Town Determination. Late in 1976, he joined up with Dillinger for the \"Crank Face\" single, and the Clash album, produced by UK-based producer Clement Bushay. 1977 saw the deejay in great demand, recording more than 20 singles for a variety of producers, including Winston Riley, Tommy Cowan, Joe Gibbs, and Yabby You, his biggest hit coming with \"Three Piece Suit\" for Gibbs, featuring Trinity toasting over a new version of Alton Ellis's \"I'm Still In Love With You\" rhythm, with a lyric that anticipated the move from 'cultural' lyrics to more material/carnal concerns of the dancehall era. This prompted an answer record from Althea & Donna using the same rhythm, in the form of the UK-chart topping \"Uptown Top Ranking\". Trinity recorded \"Slim Thing\" in response, but failed to match Althea & Donna's success. 1977 also saw the release of the Uptown Girl album, produced by Bunny Lee, and strong albums in 1978 in the form of Three Piece Chicken and Chips (with Ranking Trevor) and Showcase. In 1978, Trinity also performed at the One Love Peace Concert in Kingston. In the later 1970s, Trinity began producing both himself and other artists, starting his own Flag Man label. In 1979, he recorded the duet \"Funny Feeling\" with Dennis Brown, and joined up with Barrington Levy for \"Lose Respect\" and \"I Need a Girl\" in 1979 and 1980 respectively. Subsequent albums met with diminishing commercial success, and Trinity switched from deejaying to singing, releasing the albums Telephone Line and Hold Your Corner in 1987 under the name Junior Brammer.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:In 2006, Rossum appeared in Poseidon, Wolfgang Petersen's remake of the disaster film The Poseidon Adventure. She played Jennifer Ramsey, the daughter of Kurt Russell's character. Rossum described the character as being proactive and strong in all situations, rather than a damsel in distress. Rossum also appeared as Juliet Capulet in a 2006 Williamstown Theatre Festival production of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. In early 2009, Rossum appeared in Dragonball Evolution. Her next big screen venture was the indie Dare which was an official selection of the 2009 Sundance Film Festival.

Rossum appeared in Warren Leight's \"Daily Bread\", directed by Lucie Tiberghien.\n Passage 2:Born into a poor family in Linlithgowshire in Scotland, Bartholomew joined the Merchant Navy at a young age and became a highly experienced sailor, travelling to the Baltic Sea and the West Indies, working on hired merchant ships during campaigns against French islands there at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. He later served on Greenland whalers, but in 1795 was seized by a press gang at Wapping and forcibly recruited into the Royal Navy. Due a superior education (although where he obtained this education is unknown), Bartholomew was rapidly promoted to midshipman, serving in numerous theatres and becoming a favourite of Admiral Sir Home Riggs Popham. Bartholomew was present at the surrender of the Dutch fleet in 1799, on HMS Romney in the East Indies and in 1802 was in charge of the ship's chronometers during a voyage to the Red Sea. The Peace of Amiens in the same year saw a reduction in the Navy and Bartholomew was placed in reserve.\n Passage 3:The idea of a national cathedral first emerged following the Romanian War of Independence (1877\u20131878), which was mainly fought between the Russian and Ottoman Empires. The church was to symbolise the victory of Orthodox Christians over the Ottoman Muslims. The idea was shelved for lack of consensus on design, location and funding. The Unification of the Romanian Principalities in 1859, entailed a unitary organization of church structures in Moldavia and Wallachia within the Holy Synod (1872), thus the assembly of hierarchs increased to 12 members, including: the Primate Metropolitan (chairman), the Metropolitan of Moldavia and their suffragan bishops of R\u00e2mnic, Buz\u0103u, Arge\u0219, Roman, Hu\u0219i and Lower Danube (Gala\u021bi) and one auxiliary vicar-bishop for every diocese. The old Metropolitan Cathedral had proved overcrowded, especially during the national holidays, such as the Proclamation of the Kingdom of Romania and the crowning of the First King Carol I (10 May 1881), when none of the over one hundred churches in Bucharest were able to receive those who would have wanted to participate in the official service. Therefore, at King Carol I's desire, Romania's Assembly of Deputies and the Senate voted in favour of the Law no.1750 on the construction of the Cathedral Church in Bucharest, promulgated by King Carol I on 5 June 1884.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Burns was given the chance to participate in the first season of the ABC celebrity diving reality competition Splash but turned it down because of an injury she had received when diving a few years before.\n Passage 2:Within weeks, many Americans could recite favorite lines from the record, including \"the rubber schwan [swan] is mine\", and \"move ahead...with great vigah [vigor]\", the latter lampooning the President's own words. The album poked fun at Kennedy's PT-109 history; the rocking chairs he used for his painful back; the Kennedy clan's well-known athleticism, football games and family togetherness; children in the White House; and Jackie Kennedy's soft-spoken nature and her redecoration of the White House; and many other bits of knowledge that the public was eager to consume. Kennedy himself was said to have given copies of the albums as Christmas gifts, and once greeted a Democratic National Committee group by saying, \"Vaughn Meader was busy tonight, so I came myself.\" According to UPI reporter Merriman Smith, during a Cabinet meeting Kennedy played the entire record for everyone. At one press conference, Kennedy was asked if the album had produced \"annoyment (sic) or enjoyment.\" He jokingly responded, \"I listened to Mr. Meader's record and, frankly, I thought it sounded more like Teddy than it did me.

Passage 1:The Intel Core microarchitecture (previously known as the Next-Generation Micro-Architecture) is a multi-core processor microarchitecture unveiled by Intel in Q1 2006. It is based on the Yonah processor design and can be considered an iteration of the P6 microarchitecture introduced in 1995 with Pentium Pro. High power consumption and heat intensity, the resulting inability to effectively increase clock speed, and other shortcomings such as an inefficient pipeline were the primary reasons why Intel abandoned the NetBurst microarchitecture and switched to a completely different architectural design, delivering high efficiency through a small pipeline rather than high clock speeds. The Core microarchitecture initially did not reached the clock speeds of the NetBurst microarchitecture, even after moving to 45\u00a0nm lithography. However after many generations of successor microarchitectures which used Core as their basis (such as Nehalem, Sandy Bridge and more), Intel managed to eventually surpass the clock speeds of Netburst with the Devil's Canyon (Improved version of Haswell) microarchitecture reaching a base frequency of 4 GHz and a maximum tested frequency of 4.4 GHz using 22\u00a0nm lithography. \n Passage 2:Seidman was born on August 24, 1955 to a Jewish family, the daughter of Eileen Joan (n\u00e9e Ladenson) and Frank Seidman.

Passage 1:In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the purple-throated sunbird in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected in the Philippines. He used the French name Le grimpereau pourpr\u00e9 des Philippines and the Latin Certhia Philippensis Purpurea. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the purple-throated sunbird. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Certhia sperata and cited Brisson's work. Linnaeus specified the type location as the Philippines but this was subsequently restricted to Manila. The specific name sperata is Latin for \"bride\" or \"betrothed\". The species is now placed in the genus Leptocoma that was introduced by the German ornithologist Jean Cabanis in 1850.\n Passage 2:At a meeting between the council of Zaporozhian Cossacks and Vasiliy Buturlin, representative of Tsar Alexey I of the Tsardom of Russia, during the Khmelnytsky Uprising.

The audience responded with applause and consent. The treaty, initiated with Buturlin later on the same day, invoked only protection of the Cossack state by the Tsar and was intended as an act of official separation of Ukraine from the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth (Ukrainian independence had been informally declared earlier in the course of the Uprising by Khmelnytsky).

Fan led the troops to participate in the famous battle at the Ting Kau Bridge. In October the same year he was promoted to first deputy commander of 10th division. November 1927, during the KMT- CCP split, Chen mingshu, commander of the 1st Army, and 10th Division Commander Jiang Guang Nai defected to Chiang Kai-shek; Fan Hanjie also would be leaving to go to Nanjing. By Chiang Kai-sheik's orders, he was sent to the Zhejiang province as the garrison commander, as a Whampoa graduate of first class, and in August, Chiang Kai-shek stepped down, Zhejiang Guard division was abolished and Fan Hanjie was transferred to the NRA General Headquarters of the 8th Route Army . Soon Chiang Kai-shek returned to power, and sent Fan Hanjie to Japan to study the political and military strategies then he went to Germany, and studied in German military training school until the outbreak of the Manchurian incident on September 18, 1931.\n Passage 3:Edgar E. \"Rip\" Miller (June 1, 1901 \u2013 October 1, 1991) was an American football player, coach, and college athletics administrator. Miller played college football as a tackle at the University of Notre Dame from 1922 to 1924. He was a member of the \"Seven Mules\" line that blocked for the famous \"Four Horsemen\" backfield on Knute Rockne's national championship team of 1924.

Passage 1:In October 1987, the American Soccer League announced that it had awarded a franchise to Joe Robbie which would be located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Robbie, who owned the Minnesota Strikers of the Major Indoor Soccer League announced his intentions of resurrecting the name Fort Lauderdale Strikers and hired Wim Suurbier to coach the team. The team played their home games in Lockhart Stadium. In their first season, the Strikers stormed the ASL, finishing with a 14-6 record, best in the league, before falling to the Washington Diplomats in the finals. In 1988, Robbie later sold his share in the team to Noel Lemon. In January 1989, Suurbier resigned as coach to be replaced by Thomas Rongen. In their second season the Strikers did almost as well, finishing the season at 12-8. They went on to defeat the Boston Bolts for the 1989 championship. This qualified them for the 1989 National Pro Soccer Championship, the first American national outdoor soccer championship since the collapse of the North American Soccer League in 1984. On September 9, 1989, the Strikers defeated the San Diego Nomads of the Western Soccer League, 3\u20131, to win the title. Following that game, the ASL merged with the WSL to form the American Professional Soccer League. They played five more years in that league. For the 1990 season seven home games were played at Pompano Beach Municipal Stadium and five at the Royal Palm Polo Club in Boca Raton, after the Broward School Board denied the team access to Lockhart Stadium. In January 1991, the Strikers merged with the Orlando Lions. The combined team retained the Strikers name, uniforms and staff. Soon after Lemons sold the team to Bryan Lockwood.\n Passage 2:While in the sixth form, he starred in a production of Hamlet, which was taken to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and very well regarded. At 18 he won a scholarship to the University of Cambridge, where he read history at St John's College and earned his degree. Younger members of the university at the time included Ian McKellen (who had a crush on him\u2014\"a passion that was undeclared and unrequited\", as McKellen relates it) and Trevor Nunn. During his studies at Cambridge, Jacobi played many parts including Hamlet, which was taken on a tour to Switzerland, where he met Richard Burton. As a result of his performance of Edward II at Cambridge, Jacobi was invited to become a member of the Birmingham Repertory Theatre immediately upon his graduation in 1960.\n Passage 3:Mother 3 was originally developed for the Super Famicom (Super Nintendo Entertainment System) beginning in 1994. Shigeru Miyamoto, head of Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development and Mother 3 producer, said that Mother 3 was \"a commercial decision\", since Mother 2 (EarthBound outside Japan) had sold well. By this point, Mother series creator Shigesato Itoi had worked on the series' earlier games and Itoi Shigesato no Bass Tsuri No. 1 and was experienced at pitching video games, so Miyamoto provided a team willingly. The Mother 2 development team carried over to the new game's development, though several people left and the team grew in size. They forewent the usual prototyping phase and went straight into development expecting to create something unprecedented. Itoi said he wanted to make the game like a Hollywood film. In September 1994, he predicted that Mother 3 development would end around 1996 with a release on Nintendo's then-upcoming console. The team was inspired by Super Mario 64 and felt that they too could creatively flourish by making a 3D world without restrictions. Their early technical specifications exceeded the capabilities and memory limits of the platform. About halfway through development, the team attempted to scale back its large scope and changed its development platform to the 64DD, a Nintendo 64 expansion peripheral. At E3 in June 1997, Miyamoto speculated that Mother 3 would be one of the four titles for the then-expected 1998 launch of the Japan-only peripheral, but the game was instead converted to a Nintendo 64 cartridge-only format upon the commercial failure of the repeatedly delayed 64DD.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:The central figure in the overthrow of Rosas, Entre R\u00edos Governor Justo Jos\u00e9 de Urquiza, was granted the power of a head of state by the Palermo Protocols of April 6, 1852. This provoked resistance in Buenos Aires, however, which then refused to ratify the San Nicol\u00e1s Agreement of May 31. The prospect of having the Argentine Congress headquartered in Santa Fe proved especially objectionable, and Urquiza's June 12 appointment of former President Vicente L\u00f3pez y Planes failed to turn public opinion in Buenos Aires. Colonel Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre rallied the Assembly against the San Nicol\u00e1s Accords. The most contentious issue remained the Buenos Aires Customs, which remained under the control of the city government and was the chief source of public revenue. Nations with which the Confederation maintained foreign relations, moreover, kept all embassies in Buenos Aires (rather than in the capital, Paran\u00e1).\n Passage 2:Pronk was elected as a Member of the House of Representatives after the election of 1971, taking office on 11 May 1971 serving as a frontbencher and the spokesperson for Development Cooperation and deputy spokesperson for Housing and Spatial Planning and Kingdom Relations.

Based in Germany during the First World War he enrolled in the German Army as an officer in 1916, serving until the armistice. He would later claim that the war had been the death of old Europe and argued that one of its main positives was that it had \"rescued our nation from the deadly, slimy embrace of a lothsome cuttlefish\" in reference to Russia.

Passage 1:Jarrett's career began in South Florida, where he was a successful stage and commercial actor and print model. His first feature film role was in the teen comedy \"Summer Job\", where he played an effete hairdresser. Next came minor roles in such films as The Bodyguard with Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston as well as Miami Vice and Unsolved Mysteries. Jarrett also hosted several nationally syndicated television shows, such as \"Flight,\" \"American Automotive,\" and \"Better Farming\" for SportsChannel America, as well as an exercise video with world championship boxer Alexis Arguello called \"Boxercise.\" In 1992, Jarrett journeyed to Los Angeles and turned his attention to screenwriting. His original screenplay Laws of Deception was made into a film in 1997 and starred C. Thomas Howell, James Russo and Brian Austin Green and was directed by Joey Travolta, brother of John Travolta. Jarrett had a small role in this film as Mr. Farina, a corrupt businessman. Another original script entitled American Vampire was produced and starred Carmen Electra, Sydney Lassick, and Adam West. It was Carmen Electra's first feature. In 2003, Jarrett appeared as a contestant on the brainy television game show Jeopardy! as Rollin Jewett. In 2004, Jarrett was commissioned by Scott Reeves and Aaron Benward, the popular country music duo known as Blue County, to write a script in which they were to costar as brothers in a fictional place called Blue County. As the duo's music became more popular, the film was postponed and Benward and Reeves used the name for their band, which is still touring today. In 2017, his feature screenplay \"Demons 4 Dummies\" was a finalist in the Final Draft Big Break Screenwriting Contest.\n Passage 2:Walter was born in Kansas City, Missouri, United States, in 1910. His ancestry was German/British on his father's side, and American/British on his mother's side. He was brought to England in 1915, and educated at Westminster School and afterwards in King's College, Cambridge, in 1931. He failed to obtain a research fellowship in Cambridge and so turned to doing basic and applied neurophysiological research in hospitals, in London, from 1935 to 1939 and then at the Burden Neurological Institute in Bristol, from 1939 to 1970. He also carried out research work in the United States, in the Soviet Union and in various other places in Europe. He married twice, had two sons from his first marriage, and one from the second. According to his eldest son, Nicolas Walter, \"he was politically on the left, a communist fellow-traveller before the Second World War and an anarchist sympathiser after it.\" Throughout his life he was a pioneer in the field of cybernetics. In 1970, he suffered a brain injury in a motor scooter accident. He never fully recovered and died seven years later, on May 6, 1977.\n Passage 3:In response to a downturn in the arcade-game market in the early 1980s, Sega began to develop video game consoles\u2014starting with the SG-1000 and Master System\u2014but struggled against competing products such as the Nintendo Entertainment System. Around the same time, Sega executives David Rosen and Hayao Nakayama executed a management buyout of the company with backing from CSK Corporation. Sega released its next console, the Sega Genesis (known as the Mega Drive outside North America) in 1988. Although it initially struggled, the Genesis became a major success after the release of Sonic the Hedgehog in 1991. Sega's marketing strategy, particularly in North America, helped the Genesis outsell main competitor Nintendo and their Super Nintendo Entertainment System for four consecutive Christmas seasons in the early 1990s. While the Game Gear and Sega CD achieved less, Sega's arcade business was also successful into the mid 1990s.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

A wide variety of materials were recovered from the site and its immediate area that are now held in the Saint Joseph University in Beirut. Stone tools from the surface included numerous short, wide, sickle blades with fine denticulation or nibbling along with tanged arrowheads, scrapers, chisels, axes, burins, obsidian and a small green stone axe. Pottery resembled middle periods at Byblos and coloured similar to at Ard Tlaili with red or black washes. Both fine and coarse shards were found of jars with a variety of collared and flared necks and flat bases along with bow rims such as those found at Jericho. Vessels were decorated with stabbed and incised designs, finger pressed around the rim and smoothed by hand or with straw. A painted lattice pattern was detected on at least one piece. Comparisons were made with middle and late Neolithic periods at Byblos showing inhabitation from several phases. The site was also used in Bronze Age and Classical times and material from these phases has been found over a wide area around the site.\n Passage 2:Vassos moved to Boston, Massachusetts in 1919, where he attended the Fenway Art School at night. He studied alongside American artist John Singer Sargent and worked as an assistant for Joseph Urban. In 1924 he moved to New York, where he attended the Art Students League of New York, studying under George Bridgman, John Sloan, and others. He opened his own studio creating window displays for department stores, like Wanamakers, murals, and advertisements for Saks Fifth Avenue, Bonwit Teller, and Packard Motor Cars in his unique black and white illustrated style. At the same time, he illustrated a series of books by Oscar Wilde for E.P. Dutton followed by others including Phobia on which he based his life-long design focus on psychology, his area of expertise as noted by Fortune Magazine's list of top designers in the country. He entered the emergent field of industrial design and was hired by rapidly-growing RCA Victor, under the leadership of David Sarnoff, who discovered Vassos while painting murals at the WCAU skyscraper in Philadelphia. The company had recently acquired Victor Phonograph, built Radio City, and owned NBC Broadcasting, but needed to amplify and modernize their radio manufacturing business. By hiring Vassos, an up-and-coming industrial designer who created their first Styling department, launched Vassos on a four-decade relationship with the company for whom he designed hundreds of items, while also consulting for numerous other clients like Coca-Cola, Waterman, Universal Artists, Remington, and the United States Government. Vassos's work as an interior designer included the Chrysler Building apartment of photographer Margaret Bourke-White, Nedick's Hot Dog stands, displays for RCA in department stores and the World's Fair,and many others for which he employed modular furniture. He eschewed trendy styles like the extreme-streamlined look, popular in the 1930s, and favored the clean, modern look unadorned with unnecessary elements. He expressed his design philosophy for magazines like Pencil Points and in lectures on modern design and art. Although he was hailed as a top designer in the United States during the 1930s, he slipped away from the spotlight of his industrial design peers like Raymond Loewy, Henry Dreyfuss, and Norman Bel Geddes, largely because he did not open a large firm. Unique among the industrial designers of the 20th century, his work was focused on the intersections between interior decorating, furniture design, and the shapes of phonographs, radios and televisions. His contributions include creating a futuristic living room including television, the slide rule dial on radios, emphasis on the haptic experience of media (knobs and buttons), and the \"user experience,\" years before this term was coined.\n Passage 3:Born in what is now Opava in Silesia, Weidt was the daughter of composer and Kapellmeister Heinrich Weidt, who was one of her first teachers, along with Rosa Papier.

On the Sinai battlefront, Israeli M48s upgunned with the then-advanced 105\u00a0mm L7 rifled tank gun were used with considerable success against Egyptian IS-3s, T-54s/T-55s, T-34/85s and SU-100s supplied by the Soviet Union during the 1950s and the 1960s (such as during the Second Battle of Abu-Ageila. However, on the West Bank war-front, Jordanian M48s (Jordan was also a user of the M48 Patton as was Israel at the same time-period) were often defeated by Israeli 105mm-armed Centurions and WWII-era upgraded M4 Shermans (M-51s upgunned with French-built 105\u00a0mm tank guns (not to be confused with the British L7 105mm tank gun)). In purely-technical terms, the Pattons were far superior to the much-older Shermans, with shots at more than 1,000 meters simply glancing off the M48's armor. However, the 105\u00a0mm main gun of the Israeli Shermans fired a HEAT round designed to defeat the Soviet T-62 tank, which was the USSR's response to the M48's successor in US service, the M60 Patton. The Jordanian Pattons' general failure on the West Bank could also be attributed to excellent Israeli air superiority. The Israeli Army captured about 100 Jordanian M48 and M48A1 tanks and pressed them into service in their own units after the war, as the same as were the Jordanian M113 APCs they seized during the war.\n Passage 2:Originally from New Brunswick, Harrison graduated from Nova Scotia Agricultural College in 1922, and, in 1924, from the Ontario Agricultural College with a B.Sc. in agriculture. He earned an MSc in plant pathology from Macdonald Campus of McGill University a year later. A doctoral degree he started at the University of Toronto in 1929 was abandoned due to the Great Depression. He established a herbarium of mycological specimens where he was employed for many years at the Kentville Research Station (now the Atlantic Food and Horticulture Research Centre); most of his collections are now housed at the Canadian National Mycological Herbarium. His early research concerned the fungal infestation of plants, such as that of Colletotrichum lindemuthianum on beans (Phaseolus). Working with John Frederick DeWitt Hockey, they made many contributions to the control and prevention of diseases of horticultural crops. They were among the first to use the sticky slide spore trap to estimate the densities of fungal spores.\n Passage 3:On the song \"The Kid Frankie\", Khalifa raps over the English R&B band Loose Ends' No. 1 hit single, \"Hangin' on a String\" (1985).

The song \"Never Been\" samples \"Schala's Theme\" from the soundtrack to the video game Chrono Trigger with its soundtrack composed by Yasunori Mitsuda. The song \"Up\", samples Tevin Campbell's \"Could It Be\". \"In the Cut\" samples \"Let Go\" by Frou Frou from the end credits of the film Garden State, the song \"We're Done\" samples the single \"Our Time Is Here\" by Demi Lovato from the Disney soundtrack Camp Rock. The song \"Visions\" contains a sample from \"Huit Octobre 1971\" by Cortex. \"Spotlight\" sampled \"Theme from the Planets\" by Dexter Wansel, from his album \"Life on Mars\" (1976) and \"Still Blazin\" samples Alborosie's song of the same name.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

His records were used by the zoologists Albert G\u00fcnther and Alfred Newton to write the first scientific description of the Rodrigues starling in 1879. During a stay in Mauritius in 1875 he and George Gulliver explored the flora, the herpetofauna, and the aquatic avifauna. In 1885 he traveled with Thomas Carter to Iceland. Based partly on his work there, he wrote the Manual of the Birds of Iceland, published in 1901. In 1897 Slater described the short-tailed parrotbill (Paradoxornis davidianus) and the sulphur-breasted warbler (Phylloscopus ricketti).

Passage 1:At the start of the Second World War before the US entered the war, there were a large number of American volunteers offering their services. No. 71 was formed at RAF Church Fenton on 19 September 1940 with Brewster Buffalos. Appraisal by Royal Air Force acceptance personnel criticised the Brewster Buffalo on numerous points, including lack of armament and pilot armour, poor high-altitude performance, engine overheating, unreliability and cockpit controls, while it was praised for its handling, roomy cockpit and visibility. The aircraft were deemed unsuitable for European conditions and Hawker Hurricanes replaced them from November 1940. The squadron became operational at RAF Kirton-in-Lindsey on 5 February 1941 and moved in April to RAF Martlesham Heath in Suffolk for operations over Europe. During May, it suffered its first loss when Mike Kolendorski was killed during a fighter sweep over the Netherlands. The intensity of operations stepped up with a move into No 11 Group of Fighter Command, being based at RAF North Weald in Essex by June 1941. On 2 July, William J. Hall became the first Eagle Squadron pilot to become a Prisoner of War (POW) when he was shot down during an escort mission. The squadron's first confirmed victory came on 21 July 1941 during a bomber escort mission, when Pilot Officer William R. Dunn destroyed a Messerschmitt Bf 109F over Lille. In August, the Spitfire Mk II replaced 71 Squadron's Hurricanes, before the squadron quickly re-equipped with the latest Spitfire Mk VB. The unit soon established a high reputation, and numerous air kill claims were made in RAF fighter sweeps over the continent during the summer and autumn of 1941. In December, the Squadron was rested back at Martlesham Heath, before a move to Debden in May 1942. When informed of the attack on Pearl Harbor, most of the Eagle Squadron pilots wanted to immediately join the fight against Japan. Representatives from 71 and 121 Squadrons went to the American Embassy in London and offered their services to the United States. The pilots from 71 Squadron decided they wanted to go to Singapore to fight the Japanese and a proposal was put to RAF Fighter Command, but it was turned down. On 29 September 1942 the squadron, together with the other two Eagle squadrons, was transferred to the US Army Air Forces, becoming the 334th Fighter Squadron of the 4th Fighter Group.\n Passage 2:The 1943 Atlantic hurricane season marked the first deliberate reconnaissance aircraft flights into tropical cyclones. The season officially lasted from June\u00a016 to October\u00a031, which was, at the time, considered the most likely period for tropical cyclone formation in the Atlantic Ocean. A total of ten storms from 1943 are listed in the Atlantic hurricane database, and an eleventh system that affected Florida and Georgia has been identified as a probable tropical depression. The first system of the year, dubbed the \"Surprise hurricane\", caused severe damage throughout Texas and Louisiana in June, partially because information about its approach was censored in the fray of World War II; the storm caused 19 deaths and $17\u00a0million in damage. A major hurricane in mid-August produced hurricane-force winds in Bermuda, and several other tropical cyclones throughout the year resulted in strong winds there. In September, a hurricane impacted the western Gulf Coast of the United States, then a tropical storm struck the Mid-Atlantic. The two storms resulted in $419,000 and $20,000 in damage, respectively; one death was attributed to the latter system. In mid-October, a strong hurricane resulted in flooding and damage to crops throughout the Caribbean; after becoming post-tropical, it contributed to moderate impacts across Nova Scotia.\n Passage 3:On November 6, 2017, CNBC reported The Walt Disney Company was negotiating a deal with Rupert Murdoch to acquire 21st Century Fox's filmed entertainment, cable entertainment, and direct broadcast satellite divisions, including 20th Century Fox, FX Networks, and National Geographic Partners. The deal would reportedly exclude the Fox Broadcasting Company, 20th Century Fox's studio lot, Fox Television Stations, Fox News Group, and Fox Sports, which would be spun off into a new independent company run by the Murdoch family. According to Disney's CEO Bob Iger, the idea of purchasing Fox's assets came after Disney acquired majority control of the streaming company BAMTech with anticipation to develop its own streaming service (which would eventually be called Disney+, launched in November 2019). Disney was less interested in Fox's production capacities and more keen to acquire Fox's own film and television libraries to help expand the streaming service's library.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:Everett Station is served by six daily Amtrak trains: four Cascades runs between Seattle and Vancouver, British Columbia, and two Empire Builder runs between Seattle and Chicago. The station is also served by the North Line of Sound Transit's Sounder commuter rail service, running four trains in peak direction towards King Street Station in Seattle during the morning commute and four trains from Seattle during the evening commute, only on weekdays and during special events. Train service to Everett is most often disrupted and canceled during the autumn and winter seasons because of landslides along the shoreline of the Puget Sound, where the BNSF mainline tracks run. During the 2012\u20132013 winter season, a record-high of 206 passenger trains between Everett and Seattle were canceled, prompting the Washington State Department of Transportation to begin a three-year landslide mitigation project in 2013 that will stabilize slopes above the railroad between Seattle and Everett.\n Passage 2:During the 1980s, he traveled to India and recorded solo work in the Taj Mahal, and also worked with Vesala in groups led by Chico Freeman and Howard Johnson. In the mid-1980s, he began doing extensive work with Cecil Taylor, performing in his big bands and also led various groups of his own, including COCX (with Vitold Rek and Apostolis Anthimos). Then, before returning to ECM Records, Sta\u0144ko also worked in a trio that included himself, Arild Andersen and Jon Christensen. In 1993, Sta\u0144ko formed a new quartet composed of the then 16-year-old drummer Micha\u0142 Mi\u015bkiewicz, along with Mi\u015bkiewicz's two friends, pianist Marcin Wasilewski and bassist S\u0142awomir Kurkiewicz. That same year he also formed an international quartet that included Bobo Stenson, Tony Oxley and Anders Jormin. in 1994 the quartet released their first ECM recording titled Matka Joanna. In 1997, Sta\u0144ko formed a group which performed the songs of pianist Krzysztof Komeda, touring London, Copenhagen, Stockholm and appearing at jazz festivals like those in Nancy and Berlin. The idea for the project came from ECM president Manfred Eicher.\n Passage 3:Richmond Sound Design (RSD) created both show control (a.k.a. MSC or \"MIDI Show Control\") and theatre sound design software which was used extensively in the theatre, theme park, display, exhibit, stage managing, show and themed entertainment industries in the 1980s and 1990s and at one point in the mid 90s, there were many high-profile shows at major theme parks around the world being controlled by Amigas through software simply called Stage Manager which then evolved into its Microsoft Windows version called ShowMan. There were dozens at Walt Disney World alone and more at all other Disney, Universal Studios, Six Flags and Madame Tussauds properties as well as in many venues in Las Vegas including The Mirage hotel Volcano and Siegfried and Roy show, the MGM Grand EFX show, Broadway theatre, London's West End, the Royal Shakespeare Company's many venues, most of Branson, Missouri's theatres, and scores of theatres on cruise ships, amongst hundreds of others. RSD purchased used Amigas on the web and reconditioned them to provide enough systems for all the shows that specified them and only stopped providing new Amiga installations in 2000.

Passage 1:Montford was president of the Victorian Artists Society 1930\u201332. His generally good work as president was occasionally marred by a certain lack of tact. Some of Montford's best work about this period included the bronzes, \"Water Nymph\" and \"Peter Pan\", now in the Queen Victoria Gardens, Melbourne, and \"The Court Favourite\" in the Flagstaff Gardens, Melbourne. Other work includes relief portraits of eight Australian statesmen in the King's Hall, Parliament House, Canberra, and the war memorial for the Australian Club, Sydney. He was greatly encouraged and pleased on learning in 1934, that his statue of Adam Lindsay Gordon at Melbourne had been awarded the gold medal of the Royal British Society of Sculptors for the best piece of sculpture of the year. Another excellent piece of work is his vigorous statue of John Wesley in front of Wesley Church, Melbourne. His George Higinbotham near the treasury is less successful. Other examples of Montford's work are the memorials to Carlo Catani (St Kilda), William Benjamin Chaffey (Mildura), Sir Ross Macpherson Smith (Adelaide), and 'Pioneer Women' (Sydney). Montford is represented in the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne by \"Atalanta\", the \"Spirit of Anzac\", and two busts, and he is also represented in the Art Gallery of South Australia in Adelaide. He provided a model from which a portrait bust of Socrates was carved for the University of Western Australia by Victor Wager in 1932.\n Passage 2:After military service in the Imperial Russian Army in World War I, where he reached the rank of a colonel, he joined the 1st Polish Corps of General J\u00f3zef Dowbor-Mu\u015bnicki in western Russia from December 1917 until the Germans forced its dissolution in July 1918. He helped Walerian Czuma organise 1st Kosciuszko regiment at Samara in August 1918 which later formed the 5th Rifle Division in Siberia (sometimes known as the Polish Legion or the Siberian Division) which fought alongside the Czech Legion and the White movement in the Russian Civil War. When the White government of Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak collapsed in December 1919, the Polish Legion joined the general retreat along the Trans-Siberian Railway, until it was surrounded by the Red Army east of Krasnoyarsk in early January 1920. Refusing to surrender, Rumsza led 900 officers and men on an ice march through the taiga slipping through Bolshevik forces until they reached Irkutsk. From there they managed to escape to Harbin in White-controlled Manchuria, and thence to Vladivostok. Rumsza\u2019s force arrived at Gda\u0144sk (Danzig) in Poland in June 1920 and volunteered to fight in the Polish-Soviet War which had just broken out. \n Passage 3:About this time, some Dzungars informed the Kangxi Emperor that the 5th Dalai Lama had long since died. He sent envoys to Lhasa to inquire. This prompted Sangye Gyatso to make Tsangyang Gyatso the 6th Dalai Lama public. He was enthroned in 1697. Tsangyang Gyatso enjoyed a lifestyle that included drinking, the company of women, and writing love songs. In 1702, he refused to take the vows of a Buddhist monk. The regent, under pressure from the Emperor and Lhazang Khan of the Khoshut, resigned in 1703. In 1705, Lhazang Khan used the sixth Dalai Lama's escapades as excuse to take control of Lhasa. The regent Sanggye Gyatso, who had allied himself with the Dzungar Khanate, was murdered, and the Dalai Lama was sent to Beijing. He died on the way, near Kokonor, ostensibly from illness but leaving lingering suspicions of foul play. Lhazang Khan appointed a new Dalai Lama who, however, was not accepted by the Gelugpa school. Kelzang Gyatso was discovered near Kokonor and became a rival candidate. Three Gelug abbots of the Lhasa area appealed to the Dzungar Khanate, which invaded Tibet in 1717, deposed Lhazang Khan's pretender to the position of Dalai Lama, and killed Lhazang Khan and his entire family. The Dzungars proceeded to loot, rape and kill throughout Lhasa and its environs. They also destroyed a small force in the Battle of the Salween River which the Emperor had sent to clear traditional trade routes.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:In 1938 Rudenko was signed up to the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, where, at 17, she was their youngest soloist. Her stage name was Lubov Roudenko, and she was also popularly known as \"Spitfire Lu-Lu.\" She had a can-can sequence in the 1938 ballet Ga\u00eet\u00e9 Parisienne choreographed specially for her by L\u00e9onide Massine. She would later reprise this role in the 1941 Oscar-nominated short film The Gay Parisian. Whilst with the Ballet Russes, Rudenko was the subject of several drawings by Henri Matisse in 1939. Four of his portrait sketches of her are now in the Fogg Museum. Matisse also made a drawing of Rudenko in the ballet  Rouge et Noir. While on tour with the Ballet Russe, Rudenko performed the role of the Cowgirl in the 1942 ballet Rodeo until the tour reached New York and Agnes de Mille, the original choreographer, reclaimed the role for herself. Disappointed by this, Rudenko quit the Ballet Russes, and took a better-paid job performing in a Broadway production of The Merry Widow. This production launched at the Majestic Theatre on 4 August 1943, with Rudenko and James Starbuck leading the character dances, including a comic polka and a can-can number. After this, Rudenko played Grisette in Nellie Bly, a short-lived 1946 musical based on the life of Nellie Bly, and then became lead dancer for the 1946-49 Broadway production of Annie Get Your Gun, but following a knee injury, decided to pursue a career in fashion design. She continued performing until 1951, appearing in the 1950-51 Olsen and Johnson revue Pardon our French.\n Passage 2:For many people, disco is the genre of music most readily associated with the 1970s. First appearing in dance clubs by the middle of the decade, (with such hits as \"The Hustle\" by Van McCoy), artist like Donna Summer, Gloria Gaynor popularized the genre and were described in subsequent decades as the \"disco divas.\" The movie Saturday Night Fever was released in December 1977, starring John Travolta and featuring the music of the Bee Gees and several other artists. It had the effect of setting off disco mania in the United States. the Bee Gees' soundtrack to Saturday Night Fever became the one best selling album of all time. The Bee Gees and Donna Summer became the genres mega stars. The Bee Gees had 9 number 1 singles, and 12 top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart. Donna Summer had 4 number 1 singles, and 8 top 5 hits, 9 top 10s during the second half of the decade. Summer would be the first female artist of the modern era, to have the number one single and number album, simultaneously on the pop charts. She would accomplish this 3 times in 8 months. She was the first female artist to have 3 number one singles, and 5 top 10, and or; 5 top 5 singles in a calendar year (1979). The other prominent acts of the genre were KC and the Sunshine Band who scored 4 number one singles, The Village People, and Chic. KC and the Sunshine Band would enter the first week of the new decade (80s) with their fifth number one single, and Donna Summer would enter the new decade with her third number one double album.\n Passage 3:Bhutia has had limited opportunities in playing overseas. On 30 September 1999, he travelled overseas to play for Bury in Greater Manchester, England. He became only the second Indian footballer to play professionally in Europe after Mohammed Salim. By penning a three-year contract he also became the first Indian footballer to sign for a European club. This followed unsuccessful trials for Bhutia with Fulham, West Bromwich Albion and Aston Villa. He had difficulty obtaining a visa and could not make his debut, until 3 October 1999 against Cardiff City. In that match, he came on as a substitute for Ian Lawson and played a part in Bury's second goal, which was scored by Darren Bullock after Bhutia's volley was deflected into his path. On 15 April 2000, he scored his first goal in the English league in the game against Chesterfield. A recurring knee injury limited him to only three games in his final season at Bury, and he was released after the club was placed in administration. His final appearance was a 3\u20130 defeat to Swindon Town on 27 August 2001.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:More than 300 Roman Catholics were put to death by English governments between 1535 and 1681 for treason, thus for secular rather than religious offenses. In 1570, Pope Pius V issued his papal bull Regnans in Excelsis, which absolved Catholics from their obligations to the government. This dramatically worsened the situation of the Catholics in England. English governments continued to fear the fictitious Popish Plot. The 1584 Parliament of England, declared in \"An Act against Jesuits, seminary priests, and such other like disobedient persons\" that the purpose of Jesuit missionaries who had come to Britain was \"to stir up and move sedition, rebellion and open hostility\". Consequently, Jesuit priests like Saint John Ogilvie were hanged. This somehow contrasts with the image of the Elizabethan era as the time of William Shakespeare, but compared to the antecedent Marian Persecutions there is an important difference to consider. Mary I of England had been motivated by a religious zeal to purge heresy from her land, and during her short reign from 1553 to 1558 about 290 Protestants had been burned at the stake for heresy, whereas Elizabeth I of England \"acted out of fear for the security of her realm.\"\n Passage 2:The ancient Egyptians began dividing the night into  at some time before the compilation of the Dynasty V Pyramid Texts in the 24thcentury. By 2150 (Dynasty IX), diagrams of stars inside Egyptian coffin lids\u2014variously known as \"diagonal calendars\" or \"star clocks\"\u2014attest that there were exactly 12 of these. Clagett writes that it is \"certain\" this duodecimal division of the night followed the adoption of the Egyptian civil calendar, usually placed on the basis of analyses of the Sothic cycle, but a lunar calendar presumably long predated this and also would have had twelve months in each of its years. The coffin diagrams show that the Egyptians took note of the heliacal risings of 36 stars or constellations (now known as \"decans\"), one for each of the ten-day \"weeks\" of their civil calendar. (12 sets of alternate \"triangle decans\" were used for the 5 epagomenal days between years.) Each night, the rising of eleven of these decans were noted, separating the night into twelve divisions whose middle terms would have lasted about 40minutes each. (Another seven stars were noted by the Egyptians during the twilight and predawn periods, although they were not important for the hour divisions.) The original decans used by the Egyptians would have fallen noticeably out of their proper places over a span of several centuries. By the time of (), the priests at Karnak were using water clocks to determine the hours. These were filled to the brim at sunset and the hour determined by comparing the water level against one of its twelve gauges, one for each month of the year. During the New Kingdom, another system of decans was used, made up of 24 stars over the course of the year and 12 within any one night.\n Passage 3:In 2011, they released a cover of Jay-Z's and Kanye West's \"Otis\" which helped them rise to fame. The video reached five million views in its first five days of being uploaded to YouTube. However, with much pressure received from Jay-Z's legal team the video was removed from the duo's profile. Undeterred by the controversy, they released a cover of Drake and Lil Wayne's \"The Motto\", launched their own clothing line called Play Dirty and early into 2012 were invited to join the British rapper Skepta on his tour in the UK.

The Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA) ran from 2001\u20132003 and featured many of the World Cup stars, including Mia Hamm, Michelle Akers and Brandi Chastain. Its successor Women's Professional Soccer (WPS) ran from 2009\u20132012. Currently, the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) is the top professional league in the country and was formed in 2012. The NWSL season runs from spring to early fall (typically April \u2013 October). In 2017, A&E Networks bought an equity stake in the league and broadcasts a game of the week on Lifetime, and formerly streamed all games online via the go90 platform. During the 2018 season, the NWSL moved some of the games originally scheduled to air on Lifetime to evening slots on ESPNews (both channels being part of the Disney family), and when go90 owner Verizon shut down that platform at the end of July, the NWSL streamed the games that were intended for go90 on its own website.\n Passage 2:Khalid was a member of the Shayban tribe, dominant in the region of Diyar Bakr in the northern Jazira, and third son of Yazid ibn Mazyad al-Shaybani, who served twice as Arab governor (ostikan) of Arminiya (a large province encompassing the whole of Transcaucasia). Khalid served in the same office no less than four times: in 813/814, 828\u2013832, briefly in 841 and again under Caliph al-Wathiq (r. 842\u2013845). In his first tenure, he showed himself conciliatory towards the native Christian population and the nakharar princes, but his second tenure was marked by the brutal suppression of several revolts by local Arab magnates, as well as the harsh treatment of the Christian population. As a result, when his re-appointment to the office was announced in 841, a rebellion broke out, forcing the Abbasid government to recall him immediately. Nevertheless, al-Wathiq assigned Arminiya to Khalid. The latter arrived in the province at the head of an army, and crushed any opposition. He died soon after at Dvin, where he was buried. He was succeeded by his son, Muhammad. His younger son Haytham ibn Khalid ruled in the family's stronghold of Shirvan, and was the first to claim the title of Shirvanshah.\n Passage 3:The team began the 1888\u00a0season with part-time outfielder, Dave Rowe, as their player-manager.

Passage 1:The 1997 Tennessee Volunteers football team represented the University of Tennessee during the 1997 NCAA Division I-A football season. Quarterback Peyton Manning had already completed his degree in three years, and had been projected to be the top overall pick in the 1997 NFL Draft, but returned to Tennessee for his senior year. The Volunteers opened the season with victories against Texas Tech and UCLA, but for the third time in his career, Manning fell to Florida, 33\u201320. The Vols won the rest of their regular season games, finishing 10\u20131, and advanced to the SEC Championship Game against Auburn. Down 20\u20137, Manning led the Vols to a 30\u201329 victory. Throwing for four touchdowns, he was named the game's MVP, but injured himself in the process. The #3 Vols were matched up with #2 Nebraska in the Orange Bowl.

However, the Vols' defense could not stop Nebraska's rushing attack, giving up more than 400 yards on the ground in a 42\u201317 loss. As a senior, Manning won numerous awards. He was a consensus first-team All-American and won the Maxwell Award, the Davey O'Brien Award, the Johnny Unitas Award, and the Best College Football Player ESPY Award, among others. However, he did not win the Heisman Trophy, finishing runner-up to Charles Woodson, a CB from Michigan, and the only defensive player ever to win the Heisman Trophy.\n Passage 2:A son of Daud Khan, a Georgian prince and convert to Islam, by a concubine, he was born Khosro Mirza and brought up Muslim at the Persian court by eunuchs alongside young slave recruits. An intelligent and resolute in his decisions, he soon attracted the attention of Shah Abbas I of Safavid who appointed him, in 1618, a darugha (prefect) of the capital Isfahan. From 1625 to 1626, he took part in suppression of the Georgian opposition: he commanded a right flank at the victorious Battle of Marabda and saved part of the Persian troops from a complete disaster at the Battle of Ksani. In 1626, Khosro Mirza was recalled from Georgia and appointed the commander of the Shah's \u00e9lite gholam corps (qollar-aghasi) three years later. In 1629, Abbas, lying on a deathbed, urged him to protect a grandson and heir Sam Mirza, the future Shah Safi, whom Khosro served faithfully. In 1630, he led a Persian army which defeated the Ottoman forces and captured Baghdad. In the early 1630s, he took part in sidelining and destruction of the Undiladze family, also of Georgian origin, who had dominated the Safavid court for years. Afterwards, he was sent to suppress the opposition of Georgians who had managed to unite the eastern regions of Kartli and Kakheti under Teimuraz I for a brief period of 1630-1633. Teimuraz was joined by a surviving Undiladze, Daud Khan. For his loyalty, Shah Safi appointed him as the new vali of Kartli, and granted him the name of Rostam Khan (Rostom, \u10e0\u10dd\u10e1\u10e2\u10dd\u10db\u10d8, in Georgian transliteration). Rostom then came to Georgia with a large Persian army commanded by his fellow Georgian Rustam Khan. He soon took control of Kartli and garrisoned all major fortresses with Persian forces, bringing them, however, under his tight control. His willingness to cooperate with his suzerain won for Kartli a larger degree of autonomy. A period of relative peace and prosperity ensued, with the cities and towns being revived, many deserted areas repopulated and commerce flourished. Although Muslim, Rostom helped to restore a major Georgian Orthodox cathedral of Living Pillar (Svetitskhoveli) at Mtskheta, and patronised Christian culture. However, Islam and Persian habits predominated at his court. He ruthlessly crushed an opposition of local nobles, putting to death the catholicos Eudemus I of Georgia, and invaded, in 1648, Kakheti, forcing Teimuraz to flee to Imereti (western Georgia).\n Passage 3:Gradually Clayburgh shifted into being more of a supporting character actress in the 90s, taking on roles as diverse as an antagonistic judge in Trial: The Price of Passion (1992) and the interfering wife of Alan Alda's character in Whispers in the Dark (1992). After appearing in Ben Gazzara's Beyond the Ocean (1990), which was shot in Bali, and the unreleased Pretty Hattie's Baby (1991), she became typecast as an attractive maternal figure: she was the long-missing matriarch in Rich in Love (1992), a wheelchair-bound mom in Firestorm: 72 Hours in Oakland (1993) and Eric Stoltz's single mother in Naked in New York (1993).

In periods of monarchical government, exiled monarchs or dynasties sometimes set up exile courts\u2014as the House of Stuart did when driven from their throne by Oliver Cromwell and again at the Glorious Revolution (see ). The House of Bourbon would be another example because it continued to be recognized by other countries at the time as the legitimate government of France after it was overthrown by the populace during the French Revolution. This continued to last through the rule of Napoleon Bonaparte and the Napoleonic Wars from 1803\u201304 to 1815. With the spread of constitutional monarchy, monarchical governments which were exiled started to include a prime minister, such as the Dutch government during World War II headed by Pieter Sjoerds Gerbrandy.\n Passage 2:He attended the Pennsylvania State University and obtained his M.D. degree from Harvard Medical School in 1947. He interned at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. From 1948 to 1952 he was a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Physiological Chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and fellow in clinical medicine in the Department of Medicine. In collaboration with Samuel Gurin at the University of Pennsylvania, Brady discovered the enzyme system for the biosynthesis of long chain fatty acids, and later discovered the role of malonate coenzyme A in this process.

Dr. Brady and his colleagues identified the enzymatic defects in Gaucher's disease, Niemann\u2013Pick disease, Fabry disease and the specific metabolic abnormality in Tay\u2013Sachs disease. He and his associates developed diagnostic, carrier detection, prenatal tests for these conditions, and effective enzyme replacement therapy for patients with Gaucher disease and Fabry disease. These were the first-ever enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) treatments for lysosomal diseases, and directly led to great advances in the development of enzyme replacement therapies for some of the other lysosomal diseases, by many different researchers who were inspired by Dr. Brady. (An international research and development effort for new ERT for several devastating lysosomal diseases continues today at an intense pace, and numerous ERT clinical trials are underway.) Late in his life, Dr. Brady was investigating substrate depletion, molecular chaperone therapy, and gene therapy for patients with metabolic storage disorders.\n Passage 3:Achille Honor\u00e9 Van Acker was born into a working class family in Bruges, Belgium in 1898 as the youngest of 12 children. He only attended school until the age of 11. Despite entering the workforce, Van Acker read widely and joined several social associations in Bruges. At the outbreak of World War I, he was refused by the Belgian Army because he suffered from astigmatism. While the Germans occupied most of Belgium, Van Acker fled into the small section of unoccupied territory behind the Yser Front where he worked in various menial capacities. Mixing with Belgian soldiers during the war, Van Acker became involved in socialist politics, developing a distinctive ideology based on moderate social democracy. After the end of the war, he returned to Bruges and joined the Belgian Labour Party (Belgische Werkliedenpartij, POB\u2013BWP) and became active in socialist groups, trade unions, and cooperatives.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

He pursued postgraduate studies at the Brooklyn Museum Art School after being awarded a Beckmann Fellowship. He taught at Reading Art School and the Bath Academy in Corsham and exhibited his paintings in London, including a show at the Serpentine Gallery. In 1971, Stokes founded publishing firm Weproductions, which produced artist's books; from 1974, he operated in partnership with Helen Douglas. In 2002, Stokes moved to East Anglia to care for his mother. He redirected his focus to sculpture, which he exhibited at the Kettle's Yard open house in 2008 and at shows in various galleries.\n Passage 2:Van der Lans has a Catholic background. Between 1960 and 1967 he attended a Catholic primary school in Amsterdam (until 1964) and The Hague. Between 1967 and 1973 he attended a Catholic secondary school in The Hague. He attended the atheneum and specialized in sciences. Between 1973 and 1981 he studied psychology at the Catholic University Nijmegen. In 1977 he received his candidate's exam (roughly equivalent to a bachelor's degree) and in 1981 he received his doctoral exam (roughly equivalent to a master's degree.

Together, they wrote a three-page film treatment and sent it to their talent agent in Hollywood. Robert Zemeckis viewed their treatment with the intention of directing The Frighteners as a spin-off film of the television series, Tales from the Crypt (which he helped produce). Zemeckis hired Jackson and Walsh to turn their treatment into a full-length screenplay in January 1993. The husband and wife duo completed their first draft for The Frighteners in early-January 1994. Zemeckis was so impressed with their script, he decided The Frighteners would work better directed by Jackson, executive produced by Zemeckis and funded/distributed by Universal Pictures. Universal green-lighted the film to commence pre-production on a $26 million budget in April 1994. The studio also granted Jackson and Zemeckis total artistic control and the right of final cut privilege.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

He inherited his father's baronetcy in September 1828. He was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 13 September 1831 and became Commander-in-Chief, South American Station, with his flag in the third-rate HMS Spartiate, in September 1834. Promoted to vice admiral on 10 January 1837 and to full admiral on 22 January 1847 he was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 5 July 1855.

The fundamental values of the school are Zionism, humanism, tolerance and democracy. At the time, the Yishuv, or pre-state Jewish community in Palestine, was engaged in a debate over the language of instruction in the country's Jewish schools. When it was decided that the sciences would be taught in German, Biram responded by founding the Hebrew Reali School. The first branch of the school was opened in the Hadar neighborhood of Haifa. In 1923, the school moved into a building on the old campus of the Technion which had formerly been used as a British military hospital. During that period the school founded a Scouts troop \u2018Carmel Wanderers\u2019 (; Meshotetei Carmel) and in 1924 the school opened a Humanistic major, in addition to the previously offered science major. At the very same year the schools motto was determined: \"And Walk Humbly\" (; vehatzna\u2018 lechet) (Micha, 6:8). This motto expresses the schools aspirations in the realm of education.\n Passage 3:Charles Edward Cowan (June 19, 1938 in Braeholm, West Virginia \u2013 April 29, 1998 in Los Angeles, California) was an American football offensive tackle who played fifteen seasons in the National Football League with the Los Angeles Rams from 1961 to 1975. Cowan was a huge intimidating presence on the left of Tom Mack, a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, from 1966 to 1975, forming a potent left side of the offensive line, with help from Ken Iman at center from 1965 to 1975. In that 1961 to 1975 span, the Rams made the playoffs 5 times (1967,1969,1973,1974,1975), reaching the NFC championship game of the 1974-75 NFL playoffs and the 1975-76 NFL playoffs, but losing to the Minnesota Vikings and to the Dallas Cowboys, respectively. In the 1974 divisional round, the Rams defeated the Washington Redskins, as Cowan was successful against the opposing the right defensive end Verlon Biggs. In the 1975 divisional round, Doug France started in his place as the Rams defeated the St. Louis Cardinals. Cowan came back to play against the Cowboys, his final game, as the Rams could not get past them. Cowan was replaced by Doug France in 1976.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

It peaked at #5 on the Hot 100 in early 1994 and was certified Gold by the RIAA, selling 600,000 copies.\n Passage 2:Although in 2008 Baseball America projected Venable as an every day starter for the Padres in 2010, some experts questioned whether he would be a long-term solution in center field for the team. Venable started the 2009 season with the Padres' Triple-A affiliate, Portland Beavers, but he was recalled by the Padres on June 3. His father, Max, served as the Beavers' hitting coach in 2009. Following the July 5 trade of Scott Hairston to the Oakland Athletics, Venable shared right field with Kyle Blanks. On July 12 against the San Francisco Giants, he had his first home run of the season in his first career four-hit game. Between July 30 and August 5, he homered in five of seven games. In an August 23 game against the St. Louis Cardinals, he was involved in a bench-clearing incident when Albert Pujols thought he threw an elbow while being tagged out.

Player-manager Harry Wright, with brother George and two other Cincinnati players, then went to Boston, Massachusetts at the invitation of Boston Red Stockings founder Ivers Whitney Adams to form the nucleus of the Boston Red Stockings, a charter member of the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP). The original Boston Red Stockings team and its successors can lay claim to being the oldest continuously playing team in American professional sports. (The only other team that has been organized as long, the Chicago Cubs, did not play for the two years following the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.)

As his elder brother, Victor Amadeus, was heir to the Carignano princedom, the traditional occupations for a younger son of a princely house, an episcopal or military sinecure, beckoned him to the French court. Upon reaching adulthood, he assumed a family title, Count of Villafranca, and obtained a commission in the French army service as proprietary colonel of the Villefranche Regiment, and was known there as \"Prince Eug\u00e8ne, comte de Villefranche\".\n Passage 2:In June 2014, James Franco's younger brother, Dave Franco, informally announced at a midnight showing of The Room that he had been cast in the co-starring role of Greg Sestero. Wiseau praised the decision in a Q&A session. The film is the first collaboration of James and brother Dave, as the younger Franco has said that he had sought different projects deliberately, specifying in an interview at the Toronto International Film Festival, \"I didn't want people to think I was riding his coattails.\" As New Line Cinema sought to acquire The Disaster Artist in October 2015, one of the film's producers, and frequent Franco collaborator, Seth Rogen, was in negotiations to play The Rooms script supervisor, Sandy Schklair. Schklair expressed concern over the film's portrayal of him, as Rogen did not pursue contact with him, despite his offers to sit down and discuss the film. The remainder of the principal cast were revealed in the days prior to the beginning of filming, in early December 2015: Josh Hutcherson plays Philip Haldiman, Ari Graynor as Juliette Danielle, Jacki Weaver as Carolyn Minnott, Hannibal Buress as Bill Meur, Andrew Santino as Scott Holmes, and Zac Efron as Dan Janjigian. Dave Franco's wife, Alison Brie, joined the cast in the role of Sestero's then-girlfriend, Amber, and Sharon Stone was later announced to have been cast as Hollywood talent agent Iris Burton. Sestero stated in January 2016 that Bryan Cranston had been cast in the film in an undisclosed role. In November 2016, he was revealed to be playing himself during his time working on Malcolm in the Middle.\n Passage 3:During the Crisis of the Third Century the Roman Empire nearly collapsed under the combined pressures of invasions, military anarchy and civil wars, and hyperinflation. In 284, emperor Diocletian restored political stability. He carried out thorough administrative reforms to maintain order. He created the so-called Tetrarchy whereby the empire was ruled by two senior emperors called Augusti and two junior vice-emperors called Caesars. He decreased the size of the Roman provinces by doubling their number to reduce the power of the provincial governors. He grouped the provinces into several dioceses (Latin: diocesis) and put them under the supervision of the imperial vicarius (vice, deputy), who was the head of the diocese. During the Crisis of the Third Century the importance of Rome declined because the city was far from the troubled frontiers. Diocletian and his colleagues usually resided in four imperial seats. The Augusti, Diocletian and Maximian, who were responsible for the East and West respectively, established themselves at Nicomedia, in north-western Anatolia (closer to the Persian frontier in the east) and Milan, in northern Italy (closer to the European frontiers) respectively. The seats of the Caesars were Augusta Treverorum (on the River Rhine frontier) for Constantius Chlorus and Sirmium (on the River Danube frontier) for Galerius who also resided at Thessaloniki.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

He graduated in Mining Engineering at the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles in 1924. After winning a scholarship\u2014under the Belgian American Education Foundation\u2014to M.I.T. to study aeronautical engineering he remained in the US working for various aircraft companies. In 1945 he was chief of structures at Convair and proposed to the United States Air Force that a missile could be developed with a range of 8000\u00a0km. The Air Force was skeptical of Bossart's proposal, partly wishing to preserve the priority of Strategic Bombers, but granted him a limited contract to develop a prototype. Bossart's major innovation was the use of a monocoque design in which structural support was maintained by pressure within the inelastic fuel tanks. After a series of tests in 1947 the Air Force lost interest and Bossart was instructed to abandon the research, but by 1951 the escalation of the Cold War enabled Bossart to revive the project that became known as 'Atlas'. In 1955 the CIA reported that Soviet Russia had made swift progress on its own ICBM programme and Atlas became a crash project of the highest national importance. Bossart used this opportunity to advance work with high energy cryogenic fuels that resulted in the Centaur upper stage.\n Passage 3:Saint Monan (fl. 6th-7th century) is a legendary saint about whom very little is known. He may have lived in the 6th to 7th centuries. The only description of his life comes from the Brevarium Aberdonense, which was published in Edinburgh in 1509 - 1510. This account has numerous demonstrable errors, but it claims that St. Monan was a companion of Saint Adrian who was with him on the Isle of May when he suffered martyrdom and then went on to Inverey in Fife and set up a chapel. This chapel was rebuilt by David II of Scotland between 1329 and 1371 after he recovered from battle wounds thanks to the intercession of the saint. This place is the modern day St Monans in Fife, Scotland. The only other corroboration for the saint comes from the monks of Ireland who recorded a \"Saint Moenenn\" for the same feast day as Monan.

Passage 1:As a youth player Karlsons played for his local club FK Liep\u0101jas Metalurgs, being taken to the first team in 1998, at the age of 17. He spent the next six seasons with the club, becoming the second top scorer of the Latvian Higher League in 2003 with 26 goals, completing two hat-tricks during the season. All in all he played 96 matches for his local club, scoring 40 goals. After these bright appearances he had impressed clubs abroad, and in January 2004 Karlsons went on a month-long trial with the Russian Premier League club Shinnik Yaroslavl. Afterwards he signed a three-year contract with them. However, his spell there wasn't as successful as expected and was very short. After just one season, during which he played only 8 league matches without scoring goals, Karlsons returned to the Latvian Higher League, signing with the newly promoted, ambitious club Venta Kuldiga in 2005. However, the club struggled financially and after just five matches had to let some of their players go, including Karlsons, who returned to his hometown club, Liep\u0101jas Metalurgs later that year. He spent the next three seasons there, once again showing great performance. He scored a hat-trick in the 2005 season, and he also scored in the Latvian Cup final on 25 September 2005, which Metalurgs lost 2\u20131 to Venta Kuld\u012bga. Another hat-trick came in the 2006 season, which Karlsons finished as the second top scorer with 14 goals under his belt. In the Latvian Cup he scored a hat-trick in the 6\u20131 semi-final victory over Di\u017evanagi R\u0113zekne and then scored in the final, which the club won 2\u20131 over Skonto Riga. In December 2006 Karlsons was named the runner-up of the Latvian Player of the Year Award by the Latvian Football Federation behind the winner Aleksandrs Ko\u013cinko, who that time was the first-choice keeper for Rubin Kazan in the Russian Premier League. His contract with Metalurgs expired in July 2007 and it was not renewed. Player was then linked with the English Championship club Bristol City, before going on trial with Southampton.

The group never toured or played a show, but still had a small dedicated following. In 1997, Enemy You was formed and began rehearsing together. They were heavily inspired by Bad Religion and other melodic punk acts. After Enemy You began writing tunes together as a band they received interest from Ben Weasel and his fledgling label, Panic Button Records. Ben would often call Fat Wreck Chords, and heard about the band through Chris, who was the bassist for Enemy You, and an employee at Fat Wreck Chords. This led to their debut appearance on the four-way split dubbed Four On The Floor alongside Screeching Weasel, Teen Idols and Moral Crux. This was followed by their debut album Where No One Knows My Name in 1999. Based on the album's success the band was asked to open for a number of notable punk bands including Bouncing Souls, Lagwagon, Bad Religion, T.S.O.L., Mad Caddies, and NOFX. The band released a 7-inch on the Fat Club series on Fat Wreck Chords. They followed that with an 80's-themed seven inch EP that came out on Geykido Comet Records, titled \"Video to Radio.\" Geykido Comet Records re-released the EP in 2017, with all the proceeds going to suicide prevention. Around this time, guitarist, Ken Yamazaki, started to play guitar for the Hardcore punk band, Western Addiction. He still stayed with Enemy You, though. In 2005 the band released their second album, \"Stories Never Told\" on Red Scare Industries. David was friends with label owner, Toby Jeg, and the label also eventually re-released Where No One Knows My Name. Enemy You then signed with Nitro Records. Their third studio album, Fade Away was released as an iTunes Store exclusive on December 2, 2008, after being shelved for a few years. Vocalist David Jones committed suicide in March of 2015.\n Passage 3:Vives i Sic\u00edlia was born in 1949 in Barcelona as the third son of Francesc Vives i Pons and of Corn\u00e8lia Sic\u00edlia Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, who were small retailers. He entered the Seminary in 1965 and studied Humanities, Philosophy and Theology. In 1974, Vives was ordained a priest in his native parish Santa Maria del Taulat de Barcelona. Father Vives i Sic\u00edlia was later nominated as Auxiliary Bishop of Barcelona (and Titular Bishop of Nona) in 1993, and consecrated to the episcopacy and automatically became a member of the Spanish Episcopal Conference. Pope John Paul II nominated him as Coadjutor Bishop of Urgell in 2001. After two years, on the retirement of his predecessor Joan Mart\u00ed Alanis in 2003, he succeeded him as Bishop of Urgell on 12 May 2003, and hence therefore as Co-Prince of Andorra in the Principality of Andorra located in the heights of the Pyrenees Mountains. On 10 July 2003, he carried out the Constitutional Oath as the new Co-Prince of Andorra at \"Casa de la Vall\", Andorra la Vella.

Passage 1:The station became WQXL in 1962 after the station was sold to the Belk Broadcasting Company. The WOIC call sign resurfaced that same year on 1320 AM (now WISW). WQXL originally aired a Big Band format, which eventually gave way to a Top 40 format by the end of the decade. However it was handicapped with a daytime-only signal and was unsuccessful in competing against format rivals 1230 WNOK and 1400 WCOS, which each had full-time signals. Probably its most notable personality was Mackie \"Cactus\" Quave who had worked at 560 WIS (now WVOC) and had a successful kids TV show on NBC Network affiliate Channel 10 WIS-TV.

In 1955, he married actress Lucia Bos\u00e9, who gave birth to his son Miguel Bos\u00e9, a Grammy-award winning singer. He also occasionally appeared in films, predominantly playing himself in cameo roles, in movies such as Around the World in 80 Days (1956), Testament of Orpheus (1960), and The Picasso Summer (1969). In 1959, he and his brother-in-law, Antonio Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, engaged in a bullfighting rivalry that was chronicled by Ernest Hemingway in his book, The Dangerous Summer. Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez won. In 1964 he was a mystery guest on the US TV show What's My Line?.\n Passage 3:The ascot is descended from the earlier type of cravat widespread in the early 19th century, most notably during the age of Beau Brummell, made of heavily starched linen and elaborately tied around the neck. Later in the 1880s, amongst the upper-middle-class in Europe men began to wear a more loosely tied version for formal daytime events with daytime full dress in frock coats or with morning coats. It remains a feature of morning dress for weddings today. The Royal Ascot race meeting at the Ascot Racecourse gave the ascot its name, although such dress cravats were no longer worn with morning dress at the Royal Ascot races by the Edwardian era. The ascot was still commonly worn for business with morning dress in the late 19th and very early 20th centuries.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:The Tremp Basin evolved into a sedimentary depression with the break-up of Pangea and the spreading of the North American and Eurasian Plates in the Early Jurassic. Rifting between Africa and Europe in the Early Cretaceous created the isolated Iberian microplate, where the Tremp Basin was located in the northeastern corner in a back-arc basin tectonic regime. Between the middle Albian and early Cenomanian, a series of pull-apart basins developed, producing a local unconformity in the Tremp Basin. A first phase of tectonic compression commenced in the Cenomanian, lasting until the late Santonian, around 85 Ma, when Iberia started to rotate counterclockwise towards Europe, producing a series of piggyback basins in the southern Pre-Pyrenees. A more tectonically quiet posterior phase provided the Tremp Basin with a shallowing-upward sequence of marine carbonates until the moment of deposition of the Tremp Formation, in the lower section still marginally marine, but becoming more continental and lagoonal towards the top.\n Passage 2:In 1908, she met John Dailey de Angeli, a violinist, known as Dai. They were married in Toronto on April 12,1910. The first of their six children, John Shadrach de Angeli, was born one year later. After living in many locations in the American and Canadian West, they settled in the Philadelphia suburb of Collingswood, New Jersey. There in 1921 Marguerite started to study drawing under her mentor, Maurice Bower. In 1922, Marguerite began illustrating a Sunday School paper and was soon doing illustrations for magazines such as The Country Gentleman, Ladies' Home Journal, and The American Girl, besides illustrating books for authors including Helen Ferris, Elsie Singmaster, Cornelia Meigs, and Dorothy Canfield Fisher. Her last child, Maurice Bower de Angeli, was born in 1928, seven years before the 1935 publication of her first book, Ted and Nina Go to the Grocery Store. The de Angeli family moved frequently, returning to Pennsylvania and living north of Philadelphia in Jenkintown, west of Philadelphia in the Manoa neighborhood of Havertown, on Carpenter Lane in Germantown, Philadelphia, on Panama Street in Center City, Philadelphia, in an apartment near the Philadelphia Art Museum, and in a cottage in Green Lane, Pennsylvania. They also maintained a summer cabin on Money Island in Toms River, New Jersey. Marguerite's husband died in 1969, eight months before their 60th wedding anniversary.\n Passage 3:In 1961, Sadegh Tabatabai went to Aachen to study biochemistry and later received his doctorate from the University of Bochum. While in Aachen, he organized a student group that campaigned against Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. In 1967, he handled Ulrike Meinhof material about Iran, which was used in a famous column in Konkret magazine opposing the Shah's visit to West Germany that year. Tabatabai gave a speech at the grave of Benno Ohnesorg, an unarmed university student who was shot during a demonstration against the Shah's visit to the Deutsche Oper in Berlin by Karl-Heinz Kurras, a police officer later discovered to be an agent of the East German secret police, the Stasi.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:The most dramatic match came in the qualifying rounds when Terry Griffiths, a newly turned professional was beaten 8\u20139 by Rex Williams after leading 8\u20132. The championship proper also provided plenty of surprises. Patsy Fagan, the defending UK champion went out 7\u20139 in the first round to David Taylor who, after a decade in the professional ranks, reached his first major final by beating Alex Higgins 9\u20135 in the semi-final. In the other half, Roy Andrewartha beat John Spencer 9\u20138 and Willie Thorne beat Ray Reardon 9\u20136 only to collapse 1\u20139 against Graham Miles, whose 139 break set a tournament record. In the semi-finals it was Miles' turn to collapse 1\u20139 to Doug Mountjoy who, keeping his best till last, clinched his final victory over Taylor with a break of 120. The BBC televised the final again shown on Grandstand and with Ted Lowe commentating the match. The highest break of the tournament was 139 made by Graham Miles.\n Passage 2: arena was the site of several historic sporting events, including the professional debut of Sonja Henie, fresh from her triumph in the 1936 Winter Olympics. Roy Rogers, cowboy movie star, performed in his first rodeo at the Philadelphia arena in 1943. The Roy Rogers Rodeo played the Arena every season for more than 20 years, and in 1946, when a young cowgirl died after riding a bucking bronco, her funeral was held there. Rogers and the Sons of Pioneers sang \"Roundup in the Sky\", and after the closing prayer, everybody rode out to the cemetery. It was also the home of the Philadelphia Sports Writers Association Banquet. Professionally, the arena was the home of the Philadelphia Quakers of the NHL in their only season, 1930\u20131931, as well as home ice for several minor league hockey teams such as the Philadelphia Arrows, Philadelphia Ramblers, the Philadelphia Comets, the Philadelphia Falcons/Philadelphia Rockets and the Philadelphia Ramblers (EHL), as well as the Philadelphia Warriors and part-time home of the Philadelphia 76ers of the NBA when the Philadelphia Convention Center was unavailable.\n Passage 3:During the Spanish reign in the archipelago where towns had already been established, Sindangan became a part of the jurisdiction of then the municipality of Dapitan as early as 1598 to 1729 and slowly people from the Visayas islands flocked to Mindanao to find greener pasture. Christianity also propagated on this area through the effort of those Catholic missionaries like the Society of Jesus or the Jesuits, the Augustinians and the Dominicans. One of its great missionaries was Padre Francesco Palliola, a Jesuit missionary from Nola, Italy who tirelessly preached the Christian message, perform baptisms and sacraments and helped the tribal people in this area of Zamboanga Peninsula. He was assigned in Dapitan and Katipunan, and met his martyrdom in the barrio of Ponot now Jose Dalman where he was killed by the subanen people through the leadership of their chieftain.

A childhood friend claimed that they were the first wrestling fans to bring signs to local World Wide Wrestling Federation house shows. Around 1971, Smith also co-founded an unofficial fan club for Freddie Blassie with members wearing homemade \"Blassie's Army\" T-shirts. As a teenager, Smith had an altercation with Kevin Sullivan while attending a live event at Sunnyside Gardens. Sullivan had been hit with an unknown object at the end of his bout against Davey O'Hannon. Smith, who often cheered for the \"heel\" wrestlers, had been heckling Sullivan (then a \"babyface\") throughout the night causing the wrestler to believe that Smith was responsible. The young wrestling fan was brought to the dressing room by building security after the match where he was confronted by Sullivan, Gorilla Monsoon and Arnold Skaaland. Smith denied any wrongdoing and was allowed to leave. Smith continued watching wrestling after moving to Knoxville, Tennessee in the mid-1970s. He eventually met Norvell Austin at a Southeastern Championship Wrestling. Austin later introduced Smith to Rick Conner who agreed to train him.\n Passage 3:Finland has always produced successful competitors in the disciplines of nordic skiing.

Passage 1:The SaGa series was created by game designer Akitoshi Kawazu, whose credits prior to the franchise's introduction include Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy II. At a time when Nintendo's Game Boy was becoming popular worldwide due to the puzzle game Tetris, then-Square president Masashi Miyamoto requested that a development team create a game for the handheld console. Kawazu and fellow designer Koichi Ishii suggested that the company develop a role-playing video game, thus making Makai T\u014dshi Sa\u00b7Ga, later released in North America as The Final Fantasy Legend, the company's first handheld title. The gameplay was designed to be difficult, described by Kawazu as the main difference between the SaGa and Final Fantasy series. The character illustrations in all the games in the SaGa series were done by Tomomi Kobayashi, who has also done the illustrations for the MMORPG Granado Espada. Although the series has been long-running, as of 2008 none of the ten production teams at Square Enix is assigned to the franchise. Akitoshi Kawazu and Production Team 2 are devoted to the Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles series.\n Passage 2:The garden already existed at least in the early 18th century. During the Austrian occupation of northern Serbia 1717-39, several hospitals were established in Belgrade, including the Great military hospital. Based on the Austrian plans, the hospital was set outside of the Belgrade Fortress (\"Danubian\" or \"German Belgrade\"), in the Serbian part of the city. As shown on the map of Belgrade by Nicolas Fran\u00e7ois de Spar, the Tsarigrad Road began at the W\u00fcrttemberg Gate (Stambol Gate), at the modern Republic Square, and headed towards \"Marko's cemetery\" in Ta\u0161majdan. The hospital was situated on the road's right side, where the modern Stari Dvor is located. Behind the hospital there was a large garden, predecessor of the modern park, and further behind it, across the road was the military cemetery. Later \"Marko's market\" developed on the spot and today it is the area surrounding the House of the National Assembly of Serbia. After Austria lost the Austro-Turkish War of 1737\u20131739, the northern Serbia, including Belgrade, was returned to the Turks. One of the provisions of the 1739 Treaty of Belgrade stated that Austria had to demolish all the fortifications and military and civilian buildings it has constructed during the occupation. Many Baroque buildings were demolished. However, Austria didn't demolish the buildings outside of the fortress walls, including the Great military hospital, which, albeit as a ruin, survived until the next Austrian occupation in 1788.\n Passage 3:Allen moved to Lymington, Hampshire in 1964, when his parents took over The Mayflower pub in the town. Shortly after moving there, he began playing for Lymington Cricket Club, where he was initially encouraged to be a seam bowler. While bowling slow left-arm orthodox in the nets at the County Ground, Southampton, he was spotted by Arthur Holt who encouraged him to stick with that bowling style. Having impressed in club cricket for Lymington, Allen briefly played for the Hampshire Second XI, before being selected to play minor counties cricket for Dorset, making his debut for the county in the 1976 Minor Counties Championship against Cornwall.

One of his few works in the Netherlands is the Church of the Holy Heart of Jesus in Schiedam. During the Great Depression, Groenewegen left the Netherlands to established his own new firm in the Dutch East Indies. Many other architects were left for the Indies during the period, e.g. Albert Aalbers. Groenewegen arrived in Medan (on the island of Sumatra) in 1927 to work on the plan for a hospital, the St. Elisabeth's Hospital (1929-1930). He was active in Medan from 1927 to 1942 to work for the Oostkust. Like Schoemaker for the city of Bandung, Gronewegen can be considered as representative of modernist Nieuwe Bouwen in Medan. Among Groenewegen's extensive portfolio in Medan are the expansion of Medan Cathedral (1928), Arnhem Insurance (now Museum Perjuangan TNI, 1930), the Roman Catholic Chinese church in Polonia (1934), Princess Beatrix School (now Immanuel Christian School, 1938), Medan swimming pool (1939), and Oranjeschool (1941).

However, the major concern for the British Army is that a prototype main battle tank on trials in the Jordanian desert has gone missing. After a terrorist attack in London fails, British military intelligence discovers that the tank is hidden in the ruins of an ancient Crusader fort near Wadi Rum. SAS-trained Major Harry Maxim, who formerly trained the Jordanian Army, is the ideal candidate to send in a commando raid to destroy the tank before it can fall into rebel (and thus Soviet) hands. However, the mission is botched when Maxim's helicopter crashes, and Maxim, an infantryman with no Armoured experience, decides that the best chance for the survival of his small team is to attempt to drive the tank across a hundred miles of rebel held desert to the presumed safety of Saudi Arabia.\n Passage 3:She was born in Yaz\u0131han and studied cartography and land surveying in Mersin University, before beginning her political career through the Women's Branch of the Party of People's Democracy (HADEP) in 1998.

They hosted the final round tournament and won all four games securing their spot at the 2018 CONCACAF Women's Championship. The same year, Jamaica competed in the 2018 Central American and Caribbean Games. In the group stage, they had a record of one win and two losses, but did not advance to the knockout round. At the 2018 CONCACAF Women's Championship, Jamaica was drawn into Group B alongside Canada, Costa Rica and Cuba. In their first match against Canada, they played well but lost 2\u20130. Jamaica secured an upset 1\u20130 victory over Costa Rica in their second match, thanks in part to the great play of goalkeeper Sydney Schneider. In their final group match against Cuba, Jamaica won 9\u20130. As a result of Costa Rica losing their final group match, Jamaica finished second in their group and advanced to the semi-finals where they would face the number one ranked United States.

The album was produced by Andy McCoy and Michael Monroe who were known as \"The Muddy Twins\". In 1982 Hanoi Rocks recorded and released their second studio album Oriental Beat in London. The original cover's back side featured Andy McCoy's then girlfriend Anna's naked breasts painted blue and red with \"Hanoi Roxx\" written across it. After the album's release, the band moved to London the same year, and subsequently fired drummer Gyp Casino before hiring Hanoi Rocks fan Nicholas Dingley, better known as Razzle, as drummer. The line-up with Razzle is considered the definitive version of Hanoi Rocks. Later that year the band released Self Destruction Blues, which had Razzle on the cover, but he didn't play on the album, because it was actually a compilation of old singles. The tour for the album took the band to Asia for the first time. The next year 1983, the band released Back to Mystery City and after that, in 1984, the band worked with producer Bob Ezrin, and released Two Steps from the Move. Before this, McCoy had written most of the songs by himself, but for this album Bob Ezrin helped McCoy with the writing, along with Monroe. He also got some help with the lyrics from legendary Ian Hunter (of Mott The Hoople). After Razzle's death, Sam Yaffa left the band due to personal differences with McCoy (amongst other reasons he was now engaged to Anna, McCoy's former girlfriend known from the Oriental Beat cover). The band tried out new members (amongst them The Clash ex-drummer Terry Chimes and bassist Ren\u00e9 Berg), but things didn't work out, so the band disbanded in 1985.\n Passage 3:In late 2010, Mathews often worked as the color commentator on Raw due to Jerry Lawler's increased in-ring competition.

Passage 1:From the mid-1970s, DJs in early discoth\u00e8ques were performing similar tricks with disco songs (using loops and tape edits) to get dancers on the floor and keep them there. One noteworthy figure was Tom Moulton who invented the dance remix as we now know it. Though not a DJ (a popular misconception), Moulton had begun his career by making a homemade mix tape for a Fire Island dance club in the late 1960s. His tapes eventually became popular and he came to the attention of the music industry in New York City. At first Moulton was simply called upon to improve the aesthetics of dance-oriented recordings before release (\"I didn't do the remix, I did the mix\"\u2014Tom Moulton). Eventually, he moved from being a \"fix it\" man on pop records to specializing in remixes for the dance floor. Along the way, he invented the breakdown section and the 12-inch single vinyl format. Walter Gibbons provided the dance version of the first commercial 12-inch single (\"Ten Percent\", by Double Exposure). Contrary to popular belief, Gibbons did not mix the record. In fact his version was a re-edit of the original mix. Moulton, Gibbons and their contemporaries (Jim Burgess, Tee Scott, and later Larry Levan and Shep Pettibone) at Salsoul Records proved to be the most influential group of remixers for the disco era. The Salsoul catalog is seen (especially in the UK and Europe) as being the \"canon\" for the disco mixer's art form. Pettibone is among a very small number of remixers whose work successfully transitioned from the disco to the House era. (He is certainly the most high-profile remixer to do so.) His contemporaries included Arthur Baker and Fran\u00e7ois Kevorkian.\n Passage 2:The USS Essex had been constructed in 1856. She was a 1000-ton river gunboat, converted from her original role as a timberclad ferry named New Era. She was armed with one 32-pounder cannon, three Dahlgren smooth bores, one Dahlgren smoothbore and a 12-pounder howitzer. The USS St Louis was a City class ironclad built in 1861 at Carondelet, Missouri. She was armed with three 8-inch smoothbores, four 42-pounder rifles, six 32-pounder rifles and one 12-pounder rifle at the time of her service at Lucas Bend. Both ships were sent to Cairo, Illinois, early in the Civil War as part of troop transports moving the army into Tennessee. Illinois, a Union state which contributed 250,000 men to the Union Army, a figure surpassed by only New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, was a key theater. Cairo, at the confluence between the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, was a key supply point and headquarters for Flag Officer Andrew Hull Foote and General Ulysses S. Grant. It was defended by Fort Defiance. The complex river network provided routes for the Union gunboats into the heart of the Confederate forces; however the water levels \u2013 particularly in the Tennessee River \u2013 were often not sufficient for gunboats to pass.\n Passage 3:\"Something\" received the Ivor Novello Award for the \"Best Song Musically and Lyrically\" of 1969. Harrison subsequently performed the song at his Concert for Bangladesh shows in 1971 and throughout the two tours he made as a solo artist. Up to the late 1970s, it had been covered by over 150 artists, making it the second-most covered Beatles composition after \"Yesterday\". Shirley Bassey had a top-five UK hit with her 1970 recording, while Frank Sinatra regularly performed the song. Other artists who have covered \"Something\" include Elvis Presley, Ray Charles, Peggy Lee, James Brown, Tony Bennett, Andy Williams, Smokey Robinson and Ike & Tina Turner. In 1999, Broadcast Music Incorporated named \"Something\" as the 17th-most performed song of the twentieth century, with 5 million performances. In 2004, it was ranked at number 278 on Rolling Stones list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\", while two years later, Mojo placed it at number 7 in the magazine's list of the Beatles' best songs.

Passage 1:Charles Bertram was born in London in 1723. He was the son of an English silk dyer who was usually accounted to have emigrated to Copenhagen, Denmark, among the retinue of Princess Louisa, a daughter of George\u00a0II, upon her marriage to Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark in 1743. (The prince became King\u00a0Frederick\u00a0V three years later.) Other sources suggest the father immigrated earlier, in 1738. The father established himself as a hosier in 1744, and Charles seems to have benefited from the warm reception that Louisa and her retinue received from the Danes. On 5 July 1747, Charles petitioned the University of Copenhagen's Consortium for admission to study history, antiquities, philosophy, and mathematics. This seems to have been granted, although students were generally required to adhere to the Danish Church and Bertram remained Anglican. He became a friend and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Hans Gram, the royal librarian and a member of the privy council. On 23 March 1748, Bertram petitioned the king to be permitted to give public lectures on the English language and became a teacher of English in the Royal Marine Academy in Copenhagen. (Some accounts name him as a professor, rather than a tutor; if so, that status would have been granted some years later, as he was a new undergraduate in 1747.) His 1749 chrestomathy An Essay on the Excellency and Style of the English Tongue has been called the initiation of English-language printing in Denmark. A brother apparently died at sea in 1752, and at some point he married Cathrine Marie Gold.\n Passage 2:Kleinendorst played for Providence College for four years, from 1979\u201380 to 1982\u201383, for Lou Lamoriello.

Passage 1:An early recorded use of foreign auxiliaries dates back to Ancient Egypt, the thirteenth century BC, when Pharaoh Ramesses II used 11,000 mercenaries during his battles. A long established foreign corps in the Egyptian forces were the Medjay\u2014a generic term given to tribal scouts and light infantry recruited from Nubia serving from the late period of the Old Kingdom through that of the New Kingdom. Other warriors recruited from outside the borders of Egypt included Libyan, Syrian and Canaanite contingents under the New Kingdom and Sherdens from Sardinia who appear in their distinctive horned helmets on wall paintings as body guards for Ramesses II. Celtic mercenaries were greatly employed in the Greek world (leading to the sack of Delphi and the Celtic settlement of Galatia). The Greek rulers of Ptolemaic Egypt, too, used Celtic mercenaries. Carthage was unique for relying primarily on mercenaries to fight its wars, particularly Gaul and Spanish mercenaries.\n Passage 2:Its location at the foot of the historic Pierre Pertuis pass (in operation since the Roman era) made the villages an important stopping point and transportation hub. The Petinesca Roman road ran to the east of Sonceboz before it crossed the Jura mountains. The ruins of a 4th-century Roman settlement have been discovered at the Le Ch\u00e2tillon ridge. After the collapse of the Roman Empire, a medieval settlement developed over the Roman settlement. In 999 Moutier-Grandval Abbey gave the local farms and the Summavallis chapel to the Prince-Bishop of Basel. The Prince-Bishop assigned Moutier-Grandval Abbey to administer the village as the bailiff and the parish priest (placing the Abbey over the secular and spiritual needs of the village). This organization continued until Sonceboz and Sombeval accepted the Protestant Reformation in 1530. After the Reformation, the villages were under the secular administration of Erguel. After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, Sonceboz-Sombeval became part of the French D\u00e9partement of Mont-Terrible. Three years later, in 1800 it became part of the D\u00e9partement of Haut-Rhin. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, Sonceboz-Sombeval was assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815.\n Passage 3:An early interest in critical theology made him suspect to some more 'orthodox' Christians. However, he increasingly came to the conclusion that liberal theology failed to account adequately for the moral problem of the guilty conscience. This led him to a moral crisis which he found resolved in the atoning work of Christ. The experience helped to shape and inform a vigorous interest in the issues of holiness and atonement. Although Forsyth rejected many of his earlier liberal leanings he retained many of Adolf von Harnack's criticisms of Chalcedonian Christology. This led him to expound a kenotic doctrine of the incarnation (clearly influenced by Bishop Charles Gore and Thomasius). Where he differed from other kenotic theologies of the atonement was the claim that Christ did not give up his divine attributes but condensed them; i.e., the incarnation was the expression of God's omnipotence rather than its negation. His theology and attack on liberal Christianity can be found in his most famous work, The Person and Place of Christ (1909), which anticipated much of the neo-orthodox theology of the next generation. He has sometimes been coined the 'Barthian before Barth', but this fails to account for many areas of divergence with the Swiss theologian's thought.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:Midori gave her first public performance at the age of six, playing one of the 24 Caprices of Paganini in her native Osaka. In 1982 she and her mother moved to New York City, where Midori started violin studies with Dorothy DeLay at Pre-College Division of Juilliard School and the Aspen Music Festival and School. As her audition piece, Midori performed Bach's thirteen-minute-long Chaconne, generally considered one of the most difficult solo violin pieces. In the same year, she made her concert debut with the New York Philharmonic under Zubin Mehta, a conductor with whom she would later record on the Sony Classical label. In 1986 came her legendary performance of Leonard Bernstein's Serenade at Tanglewood, conducted by Bernstein. During the performance, she broke the E string on her violin, then again on the concertmaster's Stradivarius after she borrowed it. She finished the performance with the associate concertmaster's Guadagnini and received a standing ovation. The next day The New York Times front page carried the headline, \"Girl, 14, Conquers Tanglewood with 3 Violins\".\n Passage 2:Eisner had used some of Digital Domain's processors to render images for his film, and the company suggested he meet with some commercial production houses. Thus began his career as a director of commercials, and after only a year-and-a-half, Eisner had directed 14 high-profile spots. His first commercial was Budweiser's Powersurge, which aired during the 1997 Super Bowl. He also took the helm for Rold Gold pretzels' \"Comrades\" starring Jason Alexander, which featured Pretzel Boy on a rescue mission to the Mir space station. Eisner's two anti-smoking spots for the California Department of Health Services, \"Gala Event\" and \"Funeral\", were selected as Best Spots in back-to-back issues of Adweek. In addition, Eisner's \"Mad Dog\" for Coors's Zima aired during the Seinfeld finale and was chosen by USA Today \"Ad Meter\" as the #1 spot.

The song peaked at #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart on February 19, 1977. On other US charts, \"Enjoy Yourself\" peaked at #2 on the Hot Soul Singles chart, and #33 on the National Disco Action Top 40 chart. On February 14, 1989, it became the group's first single to be certified Platinum by the RIAA. It was also the group's first song to feature new member Randy Jackson, who replaced Jermaine when he decided to stay at Motown after his brothers left. The song is sampled on the track \"Let's Have a Party\" by the Backstreet Boys, which appears on their 1996 self-titled debut album. The song is credited to Philadelphia songwriters/producers Gamble and Huff; however, a session musician from Gamble and Huff\u2019s in-house band recalled that the late guitarist T.J.

Italian annexation of Massawa denied the Ethiopian Empire of Yohannes IV an outlet to the sea and prevented any expansion of French Somaliland. At the same time, Italy occupied territory on the south side of the horn of Africa, forming what would become Italian Somaliland. However, Italy coveted Ethiopia itself and, in 1887, Italian Prime Minister Agostino Depretis ordered an invasion, leading to the Eritrea War. This invasion was halted after the loss of five hundred Italian troops at the Battle of Dogali. Depretis's successor, Prime Minister Francesco Crispi signed the Treaty of Wuchale in 1889 with Menelik II, the new emperor. This treaty ceded Ethiopian territory around Massawa to Italy to form the colony of Italian Eritrea, and \u2013 at least, according to the Italian version of the treaty \u2013 made Ethiopia an Italian protectorate. Relations between Italy and Menelik deteriorated over the next few years until the First Italo-Ethiopian War broke out in 1895, when Crispi ordered Italian troops into the country. Vastly outnumbered and poorly equipped, the result was a decisive defeat for Italy at the hands of Ethiopian forces at the Battle of Adwa in 1896. The Ethiopians were supported by Russian advisers and equipment, as well as by a unit of Russian volunteers. The death toll was 6,889, including 4,133 Italians. The Ethiopians counted at least 4,000 dead and 10,000 wounded. Total Italian, Eritrean, and Somali deaths, including those from disease, were estimated at 9,000.\n Passage 3:In 1863 he married Helen Magruder, daughter of Commodore George Allan Magruder, of the United States Navy.

Set between 1548 and 1558, it is part of Philippa Gregory's Tudor series. The series includes The Boleyn Inheritance. The novel chronicles the changing fortunes of Mary I of England and her half-sister Elizabeth through the eyes of the fictional Hannah Green, a Marrano girl escaping to England from Spain where her mother was burned at the stake for being Jewish. Hannah is discovered by Robert Dudley and John Dee and subsequently begged as a fool to Edward VI. She witnesses and becomes caught up the intrigues of the young king's court, and later those of his sisters. As Mary, Elizabeth, and Robert Dudley use Hannah to gather information on their rivals and further their own aims, the novel can plausibly present each side in the complex story. The Queen's Fool follows Hannah from ages fourteen to nineteen, and her coming-of-age is interspersed among the historical narrative (see Bildungsroman).

The royal estate was then purchased in 1758 by Count Adam Gottlob Moltke, who completely changed the original pavilion and garden with the help of French architect Nicolas-Henri Jardin between 1759 and 1763.

It survives as part of a composite manuscript volume held at the British Library with the mark Cotton Claudius A.v, in which it appears on folios 2\u201345. An edition of the Chronicon was published in 1723 by Joseph Sparke, in a collection of English histories by various writers. According to John Allen Giles, in the preface to his own edition published by the Caxton Society in 1845, the Chronicon was attributed by both Simon Patrick and Henry Wharton to John of Caleto (or \"Caux\"), who was an abbot of Peterborough (1250\u20131262). Giles reported a marginal note in the manuscript making a similar attribution, besides a similar note at the beginning of the manuscript stating that it belonged to Peterborough Abbey. However, Giles observed that this manuscript attribution was \"comparatively modern\", and regarded the chronicle's author as unknown.

Passage 1:The origins of the parish probably date back to the time of the Merovingian dynasty, as evidenced by the patronage of Saint Quintin, which was later almost forgotten. The second patron saint of the church is Saint Blaise, of whom St. Quintin had a head reliquary. St. Quintin was first mentioned in a document in 774. Later, the first inner-city parish cemetery was located near the church (first mention in sources around 1100). It is regarded as certain that St. Quintin already existed in the 8th century; in the 7th and 8th centuries an extensive church building activity had begun in Mainz. Today's construction began around 1288 and was completed around 1330 in Gothic art. As early as 1348, this building suffered severe damage when a fire, set during a plague pogrom, spread from the nearby Jewish quarter to the church, which destroyed the windows of the nave and melted down the city bell in the tower. Starting 1425 the damage could be repaired. The chapel extension south of the choir with the old sacristy (today's storeroom) was built as well. During the Thirty Years' War the church served as a barracks for the Swedish troops. At times evangelical church services were held there. In 1721 the church was completely redesigned baroque and re-equipped. In 1813 the church served again as barracks, this time for the French troops after the Battle of Leipzig. The church underwent a fundamental renovation and repair from 1869 to 1888, after it had been rescued by master builder Eduard Krey\u00dfig from imminent demolition due to dilapidation. The church was furnished in neo-Gothic style. Only the neo-Gothic choir barriers on both sides of the nave have survived from this phase. During the Second World War, the church was severely damaged during the air raids on Mainz in 1942, but the walls were preserved. The valuable arm relic of Saint Quintin was burnt, as were other precious pieces of equipment. The reconstruction and renovation began immediately. A provisional roof was put on during the war and already in 1948 the church could be used again. After the war, it served as a church room for the French garrison. A new relic of Quintin could be worshipped again since 4 November 1950 at the mediation of the bishop of Soisson Pierre Auguste Marie Joseph Douillard. At the end of the 1960s, work was carried out on the exterior and on the bell tower, whereby the church building was given its medieval colouring again in 1970 on the basis of original findings. However, the tower continued to have an provisional roof. It was not until 1995 that the Renaissance tower helmet, reconstructed by hand true to the original, was reattached.\n Passage 2:According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water, comprising 1.35% of the city. Berlin is situated at the confluence of the Androscoggin and Dead rivers. The Mahoosuc Range is to the southeast. Jericho Mountain State Park, created from a city park and from private land in 2005, is west of the city center and features a reservoir created in the 1970s and a network of ATV trails. The city's highest point is Mount Weeks, at above sea level. A prominent feature in the landscape of Berlin is Mount Forist, rising over the west side of the city. Approximately half of Berlin lies within the Connecticut River watershed, and half lies in the Androscoggin River watershed.\n Passage 3:On November 9, 1948, Flannelly was appointed Auxiliary bishop of New York and Titular Bishop of Metelis by Pope Pius XII. After receiving news of his appointment, he stated, \"I am delighted, of course, that I am going to be a successor of the Apostles, and I am humbly grateful to God.\" He received his episcopal consecration on the following December 16 from Cardinal Francis Spellman, with Bishops Joseph Patrick Donahue and Stephen Joseph Donahue serving as co-consecrators, at St. Patrick's Cathedral. At his consecration, he wore the same vestments worn by Cardinal Spellman and Pope Pius XII at their own consecrations. He was also given the episcopal ring of Cardinal Patrick Joseph Hayes and the pectoral cross of Archbishop John Hughes. He selected as his episcopal motto: \"Pro Hominibus ad Deum,\" which, freely translated, means, \"Ordained for men in the things that appertain to God\" ().\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

He died on 10 February 2009 in Krak\u00f3w.\n Passage 2:A bricklayer by profession, Ciampa also worked in the entertainment business throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s, starring in Larry Sunbrock's Rodeo and Thrill Circus in New York City and then traveling with the circus to various U.S. and Canadian cities. Notably, his act did not include the typical, tightly choreographed feats of circus acrobatics such as trapeze swinging or trampolining, but rather improvised climbing and leaping stunts making use of scaffolding and circus rigging. Spectators were frequently alarmed by the apparently ad libbed and obviously dangerous nature of his performances. In 1947 Ciampa was arrested for having scaled the exterior of the Astor Hotel as a publicity stunt for the Sunbrock Circus, concerning onlookers who feared that he might have been attempting suicide. \n Passage 3:Edwin Bergstrom studied architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and at Yale University. He began his architectural practice in New York City in 1899 and then moved to Los Angeles in 1903. He partnered with John Parkinson soon after arriving in Los Angeles. After leaving the partnership with Parkinson, Bergstrom oversaw a successful solo practice. In the 1920s and 1930s, Bergstrom was associated with the Pasadena architectural firm of Bennett and Haskell. He won a design competition in 1923 to design the City of Pasadena Civic Auditorium, which anchors the south end of the city's civic center. In the late 1920s, Bergstrom was one of five prominent Los Angeles architects, organized as the Allied Architects of Los Angeles, involved in designing the Los Angeles County/USC Medical Center General Hospital (1933), an architectural monument in East Los Angeles. Bergstrom was commissioned as the chief consulting architect for the United States War Department in 1941. In this capacity, he served as the chief architect for the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. (1941\u201343). Bergstrom was also actively involved in the American Institute of Architects (AIA), serving as the national organization's treasurer for over 40 years and as president in 1939 and 1940. During their partnership, Parkinson & Bergstrom became the dominant architectural firm hired to design major buildings in Los Angeles. This prominent partnership designed over 25 buildings in the 10 years of their collaboration, with the majority located in the city's burgeoning downtown. Besides the Metropolitan Building, there are four other Parkinson & Bergstrom buildings located within the boundaries of the Broadway Commercial and Entertainment Historic District. As is evidenced in the Metropolitan Building, Parkinson & Bergstrom commercial buildings typically reflect influences of the Beaux Arts or Classical Revival styles popular at the turn of the century with exterior use of glazed terra cotta, decorative spandrel panels, low relief sculptural ornamentation, and large projecting cornices.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

On June 7, 2003, Smith won the Pro Wrestling IRON Heavyweight Championship, by defeating Bart Blaxson, and held the title for nearly two years before he dropped it on April 28, 2005 to California wrestler Malachi. He competed for the International Wrestling Association (IWA) in Puerto Rico, where, on November 1, 2003, he defeated Glamour Boy Shane to win the IWA World Heavyweight Championship, which he held for over a month, before losing it back to Glamour Boy Shane. On July 16, 2004, he defeated Slash Venom to win the vacant IWA Hardcore Championship. He lost it later that month to Chet Jablonski.

However, blue diamonds have also been discovered in the Cullinan Mine in South Africa and the Golconda region. A few blue diamonds have been discovered in the Argyle Mine in Western Australia as well, and are offered at their annual Argyle Tender when they are found. It is thought that blue diamonds, unlike most other diamonds, are formed in the lower part of Earth\u2019s mantle, and that the boron creating their blue color originates from serpentinite carried down to the mantle by subducting ocean tectonic plates.\n Passage 3:The season 1940\u201341 was interrumpted by the arrival of the Second World War and the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia. Skopje, the city Gra\u0111anski was based in, was the regional capital of the Vardarska banovina, the Southern-most banovina within Yugoslavia, and with the start of the war most of the region was incorporated into Axis-allied Bulgaria. The new Bulgarian authorities decided to merge several of the best clubs from Skopje, namely Gra\u0111anski, SSK Skoplje, \u017dSK, Pobeda Skoplje and Jug, into one which they named FC Makedonia. Most of the players of the new club were former Gra\u0111anski players, including their coach, Hungarian Ill\u00e9s Spitz. They were immediately included in the 1941 Bulgarian State Football Championship. In the first round they faced Sportklub Plovdiv and they won 2\u20131 at home, but due to their lack of possibility to travel for the away game, they were attributed a 0\u20133 defeat, being that way eliminated. In the 1942 Bulgarian State Football Championship however, they entered much better prepared, and after taking revenge over Plovdiv in a single game win by 2\u20130, they qualified to the quarter-finals where they eliminated favorites ZhsK Sofia by a stunning result of 3\u20131 and 6\u20131. The semi-finals were played against Slavia Sofia, a team that by then had already been Bulgarian champion five times, and were the current title holders. Playing in Bulgarian capital Sofia where Slavia was playing at home, Makedonia shocked the audience by defeating the defending champions by 5\u20131. Slavia did its best in the second game, but their 3\u20130 win was not enough, and Makedonia qualified to the final with a 5\u20134 aggregate win. The final was played in two games, both in Sofia, against Levski. Both games were lost by Makedonia, the first one on 11 October 1942, by 0\u20132, and the second on 18 October, by 0\u20131. The hero and the scorer of all three goals was Bozhin Laskov. The fact that Levski didn't had to play the semi-finals may have contributed for their players to be much more fresh, while Makedonia players had arrived to the finals after playing many consecutive difficult games. Also, the fact that all games were played in Sofia where Makedonia's opponents were playing at home with large crowds of fans making pressure on the referee to favorize the home teams is often mentioned by Makedonia players, stuff and enthusiasts as reason why they didn't took the trophy to Skopje that season.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

The lake had an extension of in east-west direction and of in north-south direction. A sill at Ulloma separated Lake Minchin from Lake Titicaca. Water levels reached an altitude of above sea level, indicating a depth of above the Uyuni basin. In the Poopo basin, water levels may have reached . At Cerro Lipillipi terraces between are dated between 25,700 and 31,750 BP. Another estimate is . Earlier estimates of the altitude are , resulting in depths of . Such water heights exceed these of preceding lakes, and together with even higher water levels of the subsequent Lake Tauca they are part of a trend of increasing water levels in the southern Altiplano which contrasts with progressively decreasing lake levels in the northern Altiplano. Earlier research suggested an opposite trend of lowering water levels in both basins. The surface area of Lake Minchin may have been , or . A lake terrace at is also attributed to Lake Minchin. The highest lake terraces at and were later found to belong to Lake Tauca, making it the deeper of the two lakes. If Minchin reached a water level of it may have spilled into the Pilcomayo River, draining from there via the Rio de la Plata into the Atlantic Ocean. It is also possible that the lake temporarily drained into the Pacific Ocean through its southwesternmost sector at Salar de Ascot\u00e1n; such an outlet would have existed for only a brief time, however, before it was obstructed by volcanism. San Agustin, San Cristobal and Colcha formed islands in the lake, which was separated into a Coipasa half and an Uyuni half by a peninsula of the Serran\u00eda Intersalar; straits at Llica and Salinas de Garci Mendoza connected the two halves. Bays developed close to Isluga, Empexa and Ollag\u00fce.\n Passage 3:In 1861, Goggin moved back to Virginia, entering the Confederate States Army on July 1, 1861 as a major in the 32nd Virginia Volunteer Infantry Regiment where he was assigned to lead a battalion.

Goggin joined the First Corps, Army of Northern Virginia in April 1862, serving on the staff of Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws as his assistant adjutant general. He served in this capacity during all of the First Corps' engagements, in both the Army of Northern Virginia and the Army of Tennessee, until the spring of 1864. During the Battle of Fort Sanders in November 1863, Goggin carried a message from McLaws to Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, informing him that the attack was beginning to fail and it was futile to carry in on. When McLaws was replaced with Maj. Gen. Joseph B. Kershaw in May 1864, Goggin served as his assistant adjutant general as well.

Smith, stated that the FairTax would boost the United States economy. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research and Americans For Fair Taxation, GDP would increase almost 10.5% in the year after the FairTax goes into effect. Real investments could increase by as much as 76% initially and remain 15% above present levels. In addition, the incentive to work would increase by as much as 20%, the economy's capital stock would increase by 42%, labor supply by 4%, output by 12%, and real wage rate by 8%. A study in 2007 by the Beacon Hill Institute of Suffolk University stated that within five years real GDP would increase 10.7% over the current system, domestic investment by 86.3%, capital stock by 9.3%, employment by 9.9%, real wages by 10.2%, and consumption by 1.8%. Laurence Kotlikoff of Boston University finds that the shift to the FairTax would raise marginal labor productivity and real wages over the course of the century by 18.9% and long-run output by 10.6%. Further, studies of the FairTax at Boston University and Rice University suggests the FairTax will bring long-term interest rates down by as much as one third. As falling tax compliance costs lower production costs, exports would increase by 26% initially and remain more than 13% above present levels. According to Professor Dale Jorgenson of Harvard University\u2019s Economics Department, revenues to Social Security and Medicare would double as the size of the economy doubles within 15 years after passage of the FairTax. Wall Street Journal columnist James Taranto states the FairTax is unsuited to take advantage of supply-side effects and would create a powerful disincentive to spend money.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

On its sixth week, the song became her second No. 1 on the Adult Top 40 chart since her 2013 hit \"I Knew You Were Trouble\", tying it with Celine Dion's \"Because You Loved Me\" (1996) as the fastest song to reach number 1 in just six weeks. The song debuted at number 58 on the Country Airplay chart, though only two country stations played the song more than four times. It spent only one week on the chart. Billboard noted that its presence on the chart was unusual due to its sound and Swift's acknowledged transition from country to pop music. On the Radio Songs chart, the song became Swift's third number-one song there, following her 2013 hit \"I Knew You Were Trouble\". \"Shake It Off\" has spent four non-consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Digital Songs chart.\n Passage 3:Between 1995 and 1998 the actor began to venture into some telenovelas in Argentina, and later decided to settle in Mexico to study acting at the Centro de Educaci\u00f3n Art\u00edstica de Televisa.

Passage 1:Late in the run of the strip, and following a renewal of Hart's religious faith in 1984, B.C. increasingly incorporated religious, social, and political commentary, continuing until Hart's death in 2007. References to Christianity, anachronistic given the strip's supposed setting and the implications of its title, became increasingly frequent during Hart's later years. In interviews, Hart referred to his strip as a \"ministry\" intended to mix religious themes with secular humor. Though other strips such as The Family Circus and Peanuts have included Christian themes, B.C. strips were pulled from comics pages on several occasions due to editorial perception of religious favoritism or overt proselytizing. Easter strips in 1996 and 2001, for example, prompted editorial reaction from a handful of U.S. newspapers, chiefly the Los Angeles Times and written and oral responses from Jewish and Muslim groups. The American Jewish Committee termed the Easter 2001 strip, which depicted the last words of Jesus Christ and a menorah transforming into a cross, \"religiously offensive\" and \"shameful.\" A 2003 strip depicting a character using an outhouse with a crescent symbol on the front, slamming the door shut, and declaring, \"Is it just me, or does it stink in here?\" was interpreted by some as carrying an anti-Islam message. Hart responded to the controversy, saying \"This comic was in no way intended to be a message against Islam \u2014 subliminal or otherwise... It would be contradictory to my own faith as a Christian to insult other people\u2019s beliefs.\" The Los Angeles Times consequently relegated strips which its editorial staff deemed objectionable to the religion pages, instead of the regular comics pages.\n Passage 2:SR\u00a0255 begins at an intersection with SR\u00a0115 (Clarkesville Highway) east of Cleveland, in White County. The route heads northeast, and crosses over Blue Creek and travels through Batesville. Farther to the east, it passes New Blue Creek Cemetery and intersects SR\u00a0384 (Duncan Bridge Road). It then crosses over Brasstown Creek shortly before it crosses over Chattahoochee River and enters Habersham County. Just after the county line, SR\u00a0255 crosses over Amys Creek and meets SR\u00a017 (Unicoi Turnpike). The two highways share a concurrency, heading in a northwestern direction. During the concurrency, SR\u00a017/SR\u00a0255 intersect SR\u00a0255 Alt. (Ben T. Huiet Highway) and cross Maudlin Mill, Car, and Chickamauga Creeks before they reach Sautee Nacoochee. At Maudlin Mill Creek, they cross back into White County. There, SR\u00a0255 splits to the north. Just prior to curving to the northeast, the route crosses over Ben Creek, and just after that curve, it crosses over Bean Creek and enters Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest. Northeast of Bean Creek, SR\u00a0255 intersects Sky Lake Road, which leads to Sky Lake. Just after Sky Lake Road, the highway has a second crossing over Chickamauga Creek. It heads to the east, and re-enters Habersham County, at the same time exiting the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest. A short while afterward, SR\u00a0255 has a second intersection with SR\u00a0255 Alt. Just northeast of that intersection, the route re-enters the Chattahoochee\u2013Oconee National Forest.

It is nevertheless visible to most observers throughout the world reaching as far south as cities like Harare in Zimbabwe, Santa Cruz de la Sierra in Bolivia or other settlements north \u00b1\u00a019\u00b0\u00a0South latitude.

In 1916 he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and became an adjutant at the staff of the 48th Corps in the area of the Romanian front. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, he quit the army and on 25 September 1918 he joined the Polish Army in the area of Kuban. There, on 9 November he became the de facto chief of staff of Lucjan \u017beligowski's Polish 4th Rifle Division, formally a part of the Polish Blue Army allied to France, United Kingdom, U.S. and Imperial Russia. After the division returned to Poland and was reformed into the 10th Infantry Division, Thomm\u00e9e served as the chief of its staff during the opening stages of the Polish-Bolshevik War until August 1919. On 22 August that year he became the head of the Third department of the staff (Offensive intelligence \"B\"), controlling the intelligence net in the European part of Russia, at the North-Western Front, Masovian Front and then the Polish 1st Army under Gen. Franciszek Latinik.\n Passage 3:Silvanus was born in Gaul, the son of Bonitus, a Laetic Frankish general who had supported Constantine I in the civil war against Licinius. Like so many other Franks of his times, and like his father before him, he was a loyal and thoroughly romanized \"barbarian\" in the military service of the Empire. By AD 351, he held the rank of tribune and was one of the senior officers who defected to Emperor Constantius II at the Battle of Mursa Major, after initially supporting the usurper Magnentius. An able soldier, Silvanus was eventually promoted to the rank of Magister militum per Gallias, a crucial post, then in AD 352-353, Constantius personally entrusted him with the difficult task of driving the Alamanni tribesmen raiding and looting in Gaul back beyond the Rhine, and restoring the fast eroding Roman authority in the province. This Silvanus fulfilled partly by bribing the Alamanni chieftains with the taxes he had collected, partly by defeating the Alamanni in battle and partly by suppressing the local bagaudae insurrections flaring up again in central and northern Gaul.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Members were abstentionist from the Third D\u00e1il established by the pro-Treaty faction. Just as the First D\u00e1il established a parallel Irish Republic in opposition to the British Dublin Castle administration, so Comhairle na dTeachta\u00ed attempted to establish a legitimatist government in opposition to the Provisional Government and Government of the Irish Free State established by the Third D\u00e1il. This legitimatist government, called the Council of State, had \u00c9amon de Valera as President. In 1926 de Valera resigned as President, left the Sinn F\u00e9in party and founded Fianna F\u00e1il, which in 1927 entered the Fourth D\u00e1il.

During the period of his university studies, he was instructed privately in mathematics (Pandelis Rokos) and art (Spyros Papaloukas) meeting regularly with the architect Dimitris Pikionis who was by then retired from teaching. He worked professionally as a stage designer in the theatre and art director in the cinema. (Never on Sunday, 1960 directed by Jules Dassin). In 1961 he moved to the United States as a Ford Fellow, where he pursued his studies at Yale University, briefly in the Drama School and soon after in the School of Art and Architecture under Paul Rudolph, Shadrach Woods, Robert Venturi, and Serge Chermayeff. In 1965, with sponsorship from the Twentieth Century Fund he was appointed fellow at Yale where he carried out pioneering research on Planning and Design Methodology in collaboration with Chermayeff with whom he co-authored The Shape of Community (1972). In 1968 he was invited to teach at the Graduate School of Design at Harvard University by Jerzy Soltan and Josep Lluis Sert appointed assistant professor. There he taught and did advanced research in analytical design methods in association with Walter Isard and Ovadia Salama, receiving outside advice from Anatol Rapaport and Seymour Papert. In collaboration with Ovadia Salama, introducing the newly developed method ELECTRE he worked out a new method for multi-criteria evaluation of architectural projects (1975). In collaboration with Michael Freeman, Etienne de Cointet, and his undergraduate student Robert Berwick, who became later professor of computational linguistics at MIT, he developed a method for design discourse analysis applied to the case of 17th and 18th century texts of French architectural theory, a project funded by the French Government carried out at Harvard and in France (1975).\n Passage 2:In 1870, Charles F. Dowd proposed four time zones based on the meridian through Washington, DC for North American railroads. In 1872. he revised his proposal to base it on the Greenwich meridian. Sandford Fleming, a Scottish-born engineer operating in Canada, proposed worldwide Standard Time at a meeting of the Royal Canadian Institute on February 8, 1879. Cleveland Abbe advocated standard time to better coordinate international weather observations and resultant weather forecasts, which had been coordinated using local solar time. In 1879 he recommended four time zones across the contiguous United States, based upon Greenwich Mean Time. The General Time Convention (renamed the American Railway Association in 1891), an organization of US railroads charged with coordinating schedules and operating standards, became increasingly concerned that if the US government adopted a standard time scheme it would be disadvantageous to its member railroads. William F. Allen, the Convention secretary, argued that North American railroads should adopt a five-zone standard, similar to the one in use today, to avoid government action. On October 11, 1883, the heads of the major railroads met in Chicago at the Grand Pacific Hotel and agreed to adopt Allen's proposed system.\n Passage 3:At the time, the Turkish Minister of Family and Social Policies, Fatma Bet\u00fcl Sayan Kaya, was touring Germany. A visit to the Dutch town of Hengelo, close to the German border, had already been scheduled. On 11 March, the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service received information that Kaya would try to reach Rotterdam by car. She could freely cross the border because of the Schengen Treaty. A crisis centre was established on the twenty-third floor of the Rotterdam World Port Center to coordinate police actions. Earlier, the Turkish consul in Rotterdam had indicated to the Mayor of Rotterdam, Ahmed Aboutaleb, that there were no plans for such a visit. It now proved impossible to contact the consul, which gave Aboutaleb the conviction that the consul knew of Kaya's attempt. A motorcade was intercepted but the car with the minister managed to drive away. It reached a small yard at the rear of the Turkish consulate. The Dutch police stopped Bet\u00fcl Sayan Kaya's entourage just metres from the Turkish consulate building. About twenty police officers, forming a special forces unit, the Dienst Speciale Interventies, masked and equipped with body armour and automatic weapons, arrested ten members of Kaya's bodyguard, on suspicion of illegally carrying firearms. A German source had indicated they had obtained a German weapons permit. No arms were discovered. Two other men were also arrested, who later proved to be the Deventer Turkish consul and the charg\u00e9 d'affaires of the Turkish embassy. They in principle enjoyed diplomatic immunity. The twelve arrested men were detained for two hours and their passports were seized. A stand-off ensued for several hours in which the Turkish minister refused to leave the car. Just after midnight, a special heavy tow truck, a lift flatbed, was driven into the yard and prepared to vertically hoist the 3.5 tonne car onto the flatbed, with the minister still in it, to transport her back to Germany. The minister now left the car and demanded entrance to the consulate invoking the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. The Dutch police had orders to arrest the minister if necessary. Ultimately, she gave in to the police demands to leave the country. At the time, many news sources assumed that she had been declared persona non grata. She was, loudly protesting, taken to another car, a black armoured Mercedes, by masked Dutch police officers who accompanied her to a police station at Nijmegen near the Dutch\u2013German border. Her passport was seized. She was not allowed to leave the station for one and a half hours, while being reunited with the ten bodyguards. She returned to Germany under German escort. Sporadic rioting occurred among the about a thousand pro-Erdo\u011fan protesters who had come to the Turkish consulate. They were met by Dutch riot police, who arrested twelve people for violent assault and not following police instructions. Kaya's passport was returned on 12 March, 18:00, to the Turkish consul. In April 2017, Kaya's lawyer said they would file a complaint against the Dutch government at court claiming that her expulsion from the Netherlands was illegal because she was not given a written statement of the reasons for the expulsion. However, on 2 May the case was dropped when it transpired that Kaya had never been formally declared persona non grata and that from a judicial point of view she had left the Netherlands voluntarily.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

It was incorporated into Irvine Auditorium when the building was constructed and is known to this day as the Curtis Organ, one of the largest pipe organs in the world. (The largest is said to reside in Philadelphia's John Wanamaker Building, only twenty blocks east of Irvine Auditorium.) Curtis donated pipe organs to many institutions in Philadelphia and on the day of his funeral, all of those organs were played in his honor.\n Passage 3:Sir Christopher \"Kit\" George Francis Maurice Cradock (2 July 1862 \u2013 1 November 1914) was a British Rear-Admiral of the Royal Navy. He earned a reputation for great gallantry. Appointed to the royal yacht, he was close to the British royal family. Prior to the First World War, his combat service during the Mahdist War and the Boxer Rebellion was all ashore. Appointed Commander-in-Chief of the North America and West Indies Station before the war, his mission was to protect Allied merchant shipping by hunting down German commerce raiders. Late in 1914 he was tasked to search for and destroy the East Asia Squadron of the Imperial German Navy as it headed home around the tip of South America. Believing that he had no choice but to engage the squadron in accordance with his orders, despite his numerical and tactical inferiority, he was killed during the Battle of Coronel off the coast of Chile in November when the German ships sank his flagship.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Bethesda was interested in expanding their business to video game consoles and Joergen was hired for work on the Jaguar, due to the company receiving free Alpine Development Kits from Atari Corporation and for its superior hardware compared with other systems at the time such as the Sega Genesis and Super NES. Originally he was tasked in making a conversion of a basketball game from PC but decided to create a 2D title in order to understand the Jaguar's hardware, along with another programmer who already was familiarized with the system, after Joergen deemed the PC basketball game as a \"steep learning curve\" to convert, due to it being in pseudo-3D and being written on C language, which he had little to no experience with them and it was then decided that he should port Protector to Genesis, which was a conversion of Datastorm for Amiga alongside with the original authors of the game at Bethesda's Media Technology division on Denmark, with him providing the sound driver for the port, but otherwise he was not fully involved with the project and although completed it was ultimately never published due to many console, PC and multimedia titles competing for shelf space, with no prototypes of the Genesis version of Protector being found to date.\n Passage 3:As the City of Brooklyn grew, the area south of Atlantic Avenue, known as South Brooklyn, began to become developed, but the area lacked easy access to the ferry terminals in the northern parts of that city.

Approximately 19 different chemokine receptors have been characterized to date, which share many common structural features; they are composed of about 350 amino acids that are divided into a short and acidic N-terminal end, seven helical transmembrane domains with three intracellular and three extracellular hydrophilic loops, and an intracellular C-terminus containing serine and threonine residues that act as phosphorylation sites during receptor regulation. The first two extracellular loops of chemokine receptors are linked together by disulfide bonding between two conserved cysteine residues. The N-terminal end of a chemokine receptor binds to chemokine(s) and is important for ligand specificity. G-proteins couple to the C-terminal end, which is important for receptor signaling following ligand binding. Although chemokine receptors share high amino acid identity in their primary sequences, they typically bind a limited number of ligands. Chemokine receptors are redundant in their function as more than one chemokine is able to bind to a single receptor.\n Passage 3:Golubi\u0107 completed his primary education in Stolac, before relocating to Sarajevo to attend high school. In 1908, he moved to Belgrade for post-secondary studies, studying law at the University of Belgrade.

It is typically available in an aerosol spray can, and may sometimes be used for starting direct injected diesel engines or lean burn spark engines running on alcohol fuel. Some modern starting fluid products contain mostly volatile hydrocarbons such as heptane, (the main component of natural gasoline) with a small portion of diethyl ether, and carbon dioxide (as a propellant). Some formulations contain butane or propane as both propellant and starting fuel. Historically, Diethyl ether, with a small amount of oil, a trace amount of a stabilizer and a hydrocarbon propellant has been used to help start internal combustion engines because of its low autoignition temperature.\n Passage 3:Namakgale is a large township lying 12\u00a0km outside Phalaborwa in Mopani District in the Limpopo province of South Africa.

It reunites Blomkamp with some of his District 9 crew, such as editor Julian Clarke, production designer Philip Ivey, cinematographer Trent Opaloch, and actor Sharlto Copley, playing one of the film's antagonists. Elysium is a co-production of TriStar Pictures and MRC. Although the film's story is set in 2154, Blomkamp has stated that it is a comment on the contemporary human condition. \"Everybody wants to ask me lately about my predictions for the future,\" the director has said, \"No, no, no. This isn't science fiction. This is today. This is now.\" In January 2011, independent studio Media Rights Capital met with major studios to distribute Elysium, and Blomkamp shared art designs of his proposed science fiction film. The art designs won over the executives at Sony Pictures, who bought the film after making a more attractive offer than the other studios. With a production budget of , production began in July 2011.

Matt Damon shaved his head for the role of Max. The main role was first offered to Watkin Tudor Jones (aka Ninja), a South African rapper, who despite being a fan of District 9 (he has a D9 tattoo on his inner lip) did not take the role. The role was then offered to rapper Eminem, but he wanted the film to be shot in Detroit. That was not an option for the two studios, so Blomkamp moved on to Damon as his next choice. Futuristic designs were executed by Philip Ivey after long periods of researching and studying older science fiction films. Ivey has continuously cited Syd Mead as a substantial influence for the film. Weta Workshop created the exosuits for Damon and Copley's characters, while the complicated visual effects were handled primarily by Image Engine (who also collaborated on District 9) with additional work by Whiskytree, MPC, The Embassy and Industrial Light and Magic.

Passage 1:Black Jazz Records was a jazz record company and label founded in Oakland, California by pianist Gene Russell (December 2, 1932 - May 3, 1981) and percussionist Dick Schory. The label was created to promote the talents of young African American jazz musicians and singers, and released twenty albums between 1971 and 1975. Some of the more notable artists to record for Black Jazz Records were Cleveland Eaton, former bassist for Count Basie and Ramsey Lewis, and organist/pianist Doug Carn, whose four albums were the most successful of any Black Jazz artist. Carn's wife at the time, Jean Carn, sang on his albums; she changed her name to Jean Carne and went on to have a successful solo career as an R & B singer.

The film's successful opening has been attributed to its Cannes premiere, CinemaCon press screening, its critical reception (particularly the 98% Rotten Tomatoes score), good word-of-mouth, Father's Day weekend, and a successful Tuesday-night Fathom screening. In its second weekend, the film fell by 42% to $52.3 million and still held the second spot behind Jurassic World; the rest of the week saw it slightly ahead of the latter.

In January 1916, as a General Staff Officer (GSO), Elles was sent by General Sir Douglas Haig, the Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the BEF on the Western Front, to investigate the first tanks or \"caterpillars\" being built in England. He attended the first trials of \"Mother\" and reported back to Haig on its success. During the summer of 1916, he was tasked to report back from the Somme, where the tanks were first used. Elles was appointed to head the Heavy Branch (the first tank units) of the Machine Gun Corps in France on 29 September 1916, with the temporary rank of colonel.

In 1868, Schuyler was a guest of Tolstoi for a week at his estate at Yasnaya Polyana, at the time when Tolstoi was finishing War and Peace. He helped Tolstoi rearrange his library, and went hunting with him. Tolstoi, who was interested in public education in the United States, asked Schuyler for copies of American primers and school textbooks. Schuyler received Tolstoi's permission to translate his novel The Cossacks into English. In 1869, the new Administration of President Ulysses Grant removed Schuyler from his post in Moscow and replaced him with a political appointee. Schuyler was able to obtain a post as consul to the Russian port of Reval (now Tallinn). In November, 1869, President Grant appointed a new Minister to Russia, Andrew Curtin, a former Governor of Pennsylvania who knew nothing of Russia. Curtin was impressed by Schuyler and appointed him as the secretary of the American legation in St. Petersburg, a post which Schuyler held until 1876.\n Passage 2:Commelina hockii is an herbaceous plant in the dayflower family found primarily in Central Africa, from southwestern Tanzania in the east, west through the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia, and possibly extending further west to Angola. The species' distinctive features include its long, tapering spathes with unfused margins, its white flowers, and its many-flowered lower cymes. It can be found in grasslands and Brachystegia-dominated woodland. It is fairly unusual among Commelina species in having variation in the color of the antherodes (i.e. non-functional anthers), with some individuals having entirely yellow antherodes, while others contain a dark spot in the center. Also, it is one of the only Commelina species known to leave a papery residue of dried fluid inside its spathes; normally only fused-spathe species are known to produce this substance. Only one specimen from Angola resembles this species, but it has blue flowers, suggesting it may be a poorly understood and as-yet undescribed separate species. Commelina hockii is probably closely related to Commelina kituloensis, which shares a similar fruit type, the same tufted perennial habit, similar large spathes with dried fluid substance, and equally numerously flowered inflorescences. That species differs in having purplish flowers, hairy leaves, shorter spathes, and a preference for high altitude grassland.\n Passage 3:Gillekens made his debut for OH Leuven in the 2014\u201315 Belgian Cup in the sixth round match against Kortrijk, a 1-3 loss, although that season he was part of the reserves and only fourth goalkeeper behind Logan Bailly, Yves Lenaerts and Senne Vits. Later that season he also played one match in the 2014\u201315 Belgian Second Division against Mons. Although Gillekens was promoted to third keeper for the 2015\u201316 season, he did not play a single match that season. Following the relegation from the 2015\u201316 Belgian Pro League, first goalkeeper Rudy Riou was released while second goalkeeper Yves Lenaerts had already signed for ASV Geel. As such, Gillekens was promoted to first goalkeeper for the 2016\u201317 season in the Belgian First Division B. During the winter 2017\u201318 transfer window OH Leuven signed Kawin Thamsatchanan, captain of the Thailand national football team and soon thereafter Gillekens was demoted to reserve goalkeeper. Following Thamsatchanan's injury during the 2018\u201319 season, Gillekens again became first goalkeeper for a few matches before then being surpassed by Laurent Henkinet. Towards the end of the season, Gillekens was even demoted to third goalkeeper with Thamsatchanan now taking his place on the bench and after the final match of the season it became clear that Gillekens would not be signing a new deal at OH Leuven.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:Viewtiful Joe is a 2.5D side-scrolling action-platformer, released on June 26, 2003. The title character is a parody of tokusatsu superheroes and is trying to save his girlfriend, who has been trapped in \"Movieland\" by a group of supervillains known as Jadow. To complete his quest, Joe must use his Viewtiful Effects Powers, which are based on camera tricks and special effects used in films. These include \"Slow\", which simulates bullet time; \"Mach Speed\", allowing Joe to attack all enemies with his afterimages; and \"Zoom In\", which triggers a camera close-up and unlocks special attacks. Internally, Capcom treated the game as a \"staff-focused project\" with the goal of increasing the skills of director Hideki Kamiya. The game achieved a Metacritic score of 93 and won GameCube Game of the Year awards from numerous publications including IGN, GMR, and USA Today. The game sold out its initial shipment of 100,000 to achieve a lifetime total of 275,000 units. Producer Atsushi Inaba considered the game a success, achieving his goals of training staff, keeping a small budget, and selling well. However, these numbers were lower than Capcom expected, prompting the publisher to port Viewtiful Joe to PlayStation 2 in 2004, with expanded features. This version sold 46,000 copies with a slightly lower Metacritic score of 90 owing to the lack of progressive scan and frame rate slowdown generated by the porting process.\n Passage 2:Fioretti, who wanted to sound less Italian, started to use the name Feury, and began to be artistic in many ways. Although Dyslexic, he authored several screenplays, began painting for the first time in 1966, and began producing tightly budgeted B-Movies in the early 1970s.

Herschel carries an infrared telescope whilst Planck carries an optical one. The fourth observatory to be launched was the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, or WISE, which is a replacement for the Wide Field Infrared Explorer which failed shortly after launch. WISE was launched into a sun-synchronous orbit by a Delta II on 14 December, and will be used for infrared astronomy.

He remained at the University of Heidelberg until 1933, obtaining full professorship in 1927 at the age of 34 years. It was at the University of Heidelberg that Gyorgy first discovered and isolated riboflavin along with his colleague Th. Wagner-Jauregg and the Nobel-winning chemist Richard Kuhn. Gyorgy remained at the University of Heidelberg until 1933, when the political unrest in Germany spurred his move to the Nutrition Laboratory at the University of Cambridge in England. He stayed as a researcher in there until 1935, during which time he discovered vitamin B.\n Passage 2:Hynde, originally from Akron, Ohio, moved to London in 1973, working at the weekly music paper NME and at Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood's clothes store. She was involved with early versions of the Clash and the Damned and played in short-lived bands such as Masters of the Backside (1976) and the Moors Murderers (1978 lineup). The Pretenders formed in 1978 after Dave Hill at Anchor Records heard some demos of Hynde's music. He arranged a rehearsal studio in Denmark Street, where a three-piece band consisting of Hynde, Mal Hart on bass (he had played with Hynde and Steve Strange in the Moors Murderers), and Phil Taylor of Mot\u00f6rhead on drums played a selection of Hynde's original songs. Dave Hill was impressed and arranged a day at Studio 51 to record another demo. Although it was rough, he felt he had seen and heard enough \"star potential\" to suggest that Hynde form a more permanent band to record for his new label, Real Records. Hynde then formed a band composed of Pete Farndon on bass, James Honeyman-Scott on guitar, and Gerry Mcilduff on drums. This band, then without a name, recorded five tracks at Regents Park Studio in July 1978, including \"Stop Your Sobbing\". Shortly thereafter, Gerry Mcilduff was replaced on drums by Martin Chambers. Hynde named the band \"The Pretenders\" after the Platters song \"The Great Pretender\", which was the favourite song of one of her former boyfriends.\n Passage 3:The Paus family (earlier spellings include Pauss and de Paus) () is a Norwegian family that first appeared as members of the elite of 16th-century Oslo. Two brothers from Oslo who both became priests, Hans (1587\u20131648) and Peder Povelsson Paus (1590\u20131653), have long been known as the family's earliest certain ancestors. In his book Slekten Paus (\"The Paus family\"), genealogist S.H. Finne-Gr\u00f8nn traced the family two further generations back, to Hans Olufsson (died 1570), a member of the royal clergy in Norway before and after the Reformation, who served as a canon at the royal chapel in Oslo, St Mary's Church, the seat of government of Norway at the time, and who belonged to the high nobility by virtue of his high ecclesiastical and governmental office. The name Paus is known in Oslo since the 14th century, notably as the name of the Lawspeaker of Oslo Nikolas Paus (mentioned 1329\u20131347) and as the name of one of medieval Oslo's \"city farms\" (mentioned 1324\u20131482) that was probably named after the lawspeaker or his family; while a relation between the older and the younger family of the name in Oslo is plausible, it has not been established. Regardless, the modern Paus family is likely the only surviving family to hail from the medieval city of Oslo which burned down in 1624 without being rebuilt, making it the family with the longest documented history in the Norwegian capital.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:Foer graduated from Princeton in 1999 with a degree in philosophy, and traveled to Ukraine to expand his thesis. In 2001, he edited the anthology A Convergence of Birds: Original Fiction and Poetry Inspired by the Work of Joseph Cornell, to which he contributed the short story, \"If the Aging Magician Should Begin to Believe\". His Princeton thesis grew into a novel, Everything Is Illuminated, which was published by Houghton Mifflin in 2002. The book earned him a National Jewish Book Award (2001) and a Guardian First Book Award (2002). Foer shared the PEN/Robert W. Bingham Prize with fellow authors Will Heinrich and Monique Truong in 2004. In 2005, Liev Schreiber wrote and directed a film adaptation of the novel, which starred Elijah Wood.\n Passage 2:By August 1995, the station \u2013 which would change its call sign that month to WACY-TV \u2013 benefited from WGBA's affiliation switch to NBC (due to WLUK-TV, channel 11, joining Fox). With WGBA now committed to NBC and its programming lineup, programs that WGBA no longer had room to broadcast were moved over to WACY, including some syndicated programming (most notably reruns of The Simpsons) and daytime children's programming. With this move, WACY adopted the \"WACkY 32\" branding for its kids' lineup (running roughly 6-11 a.m. and 1-5 p.m.), which over the years would include Garfield and Friends, Scooby-Doo, Dennis the Menace, Pok\u00e9mon, Sailor Moon and Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog; programs from the UPN Kids and The Disney Afternoon blocks (as well as from Kids' WB as the Green Bay television market did not have a full-time WB affiliate); and educational and informational-compliant programs like The New Zoo Revue. The live character \"Cuddles the Clown\" provided host continuity for \"WACkY 32\" programming. The station's children's lineup would dwindle over the years, thanks in part to increased cable competition from cable channels such as Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon and the decreased financial justification of airing a more-than-necessary amount of children's programming, although it would continue to air UPN's Disney's One Too until the network discontinued its daily children's block in 2003. After that, WACY would rely on general syndicated entertainment and infomercials for its daytime lineup.\n Passage 3:The discography of Scottish rock band The Twilight Sad consists of five studio albums, four compilation albums, fifteen singles, and five extended plays (EPs).

The band released their debut EP The Twilight Sad in November 2006 in the United States only, followed by their debut album Fourteen Autumns & Fifteen Winters in April 2007, which garnered widespread critical acclaim. The album spawned two singles, \"That Summer, at Home I Had Become the Invisible Boy\" in April, and \"And She Would Darken the Memory\" in July. The following year, the band released Here, It Never Snowed. Afterwards It Did, a mini-album of reworked versions of songs from Fourteen Autumns & Fifteen Winters and two non-album tracks, inspired by stripped-down live performances. A collection of live versions and previously unreleased tracks entitled Killed My Parents and Hit the Road was released in December 2008. The Twilight Sad's second studio album, Forget the Night Ahead, was released in September 2009 to further acclaim and marked a shift in the band's direction towards a darker and more streamlined sound.

The Queen of Hip-Hop Soul and Queen of R&B (publications often refer to her as both honorific titles), Mary J. Blige is uniquely credited as the first singer to release an album singing over hip-hop beats, which created the genre \"hip hop soul\" which fuses elements of soul, R&B and gospel style vocals over hip hop beats. Blige's genre-changing sound, in many ways, changed and shaped the sound for modern day R&B and blue-eyed soul artists. In September 1999, Rolling Stone bestowed her first album, What's the 411?

He ended Sussex's innings of 233/8 unbeaten on 17, while in the Zimbabweans innings he took figures of 3/40 from 10 overs, with Sussex winning by 95 runs. He continued to play for the Sussex Second XI until 1994.\n Passage 3:While born in the United States, Pittman moved with his mother to Scotland after his parents divorced when he was two years old. He is a Scottish-American dual-citizen. He played for Broxburn Athletic as a youth player. In 1986, he began his professional career with East Fife F.C. before moving to Shrewsbury Town F.C. on March 3, 1989. In October 1987, Pittman had an unsuccessful trial with the Cleveland Force of Major Indoor Soccer League. On March 29, 1990, Pittman signed with the Fort Lauderdale Strikers of the American Professional Soccer League. He was both a first team All Star and the 1990 Rookie of the Year. On August 29, 1990, he signed with the Wichita Wings of the Major Indoor Soccer League. In 1991, he returned to the Strikers. The team released him in August 1991 after an accumulation of yellow and red cards kept him out of seven games during the season. After being ejected in a late season game, Pittman entered the stands to chase a spectator leading to league officials suspending him for the first two games of the play offs. He then rejoined the Wichita Wings for the upcoming MISL season. Despite being released by the Strikers in August 1991, the team re-signed Pittman at the end of April 1992. When the APSL season ended in August, the Strikers loaned Pittman Dundee F.C.. When Pittman's contract with the Strikers ran out, he then signed with Dundee as a free agent. In September 1994, he moved to Partick Thistle F.C. Whilst at Partick Thistle, where Pittman enjoyed arguably the most successful period of his career, he became somewhat of a cult hero after regularly performing his \"Marine Drive\" free-kick. After lining up a direct free-kick, Pittman would stand on one foot and offer up a military style salute to the Thistle fans, before unleashing a shot towards goal. He only managed to score once in this fashion, in a closed-door friendly match against Berwick Rangers. His career with Partick ended when he accumulated three red cards in quick succession after confronting referees following an end of season match. This led to an eight-game ban. In 1996, he signed with the Tampa Bay Mutiny of Major League Soccer. In July 1996, he scored the winning goal for the East during the 1996 All-Star Game. He also toured China as a guest player for San Jose Clash in 1996.

In 1883, the German trader Adolf L\u00fcderitz bought what would become the southern coast of Namibia from Josef Frederiks II, a chief of the local Oorlam people, and founded the city of L\u00fcderitz. The German government, eager to gain overseas possessions, annexed the territory soon after, proclaiming it German South West Africa (). Small numbers of Germans subsequently immigrated there, many coming as soldiers (), traders, diamond miners, or colonial officials. In 1915, during the course of World War I, Germany lost its colonial possessions, including South West Africa (see History of Namibia); after the war, the former German colony was administered as a South African mandate. The German settlers were allowed to remain and, until independence in 1990, German remained an official language of the territory alongside Afrikaans and English.\n Passage 2:Earle L. Reynolds (October 18, 1910 \u2013 January 11, 1998) was an anthropologist, educator, author, Quaker, and peace activist. He was sent to Hiroshima by the Atomic Energy Commission in 1951 to study the effects of the first atomic bomb on the growth and development of exposed children. His professional discoveries concerning the dangers of radiation later moved Reynolds into a life of anti-nuclear activism. In 1958 he sailed with his wife Barbara, two of his three children and a Japanese yachtsman in the Phoenix of Hiroshima, a ketch he had designed himself, into the American nuclear testing zone in the Pacific. In 1961 the family sailed to the USSR to protest Soviet nuclear testing.

After she and Al Kerr divorced, she disbanded the Nashville version of her Anita Kerr Singers and relocated to Los Angeles in August 1965 with her second husband, Swiss businessman Alex Grob, and her daughters Suzie & Kelly. She no longer wanted to just be a background singer or arranger on country songs \u2013 she wanted to do pop music, jazz and \"do more orchestral writing and music that was not just country.\". She hired some lawyers to get her out of her contract with RCA\u2019s Nashville division, got a contract with Warner Bros. Records, and formed a Los Angeles version of the Anita Kerr Singers. The new group, for the next five years, would include the following personnel: alto B.J. Baker or Jackie Ward, tenor Gene Merlino or Bill Cole, baritone Bill Lee, bass Bob Tebow, and Kerr herself as soprano and arranger. The half dozen albums recorded by the Singers for Warner included a cover version of the song \"All You Need Is Love\" by The Beatles, and one of the LPs was exclusively devoted to the songs of composer Bert Kaempfert. Disguising the group as the Mexicali Singers, Kerr also recorded a trio of mariachi-flavored albums with musical arrangements reminiscent of the Herb Alpert & The Tijuana Brass sound. The Anita Kerr Singers won another Grammy Award for their recording of A Man And A Woman, released as a single on Warner Bros. Records.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

The Cardinals finished the season with an NL-best 97\u201365 won\u2013loss record. They opened the playoffs by defeating the Pirates in five games in the NL Division Series (NLDS). Advancing to their third straight National League Championship Series, they defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in six games for their 19th NL pennant. Rookie Michael Wacha, who had nearly no-hit the Washington Nationals late in September, continued his dominance throughout the postseason as he allowed no runs against the Dodgers in 13 IP, earning the NLCS MVP. It was the second straight NLCS appearance to which manager Mike Matheny guided the Cardinals, who became the first manager to appear in an LCS in his first two seasons.

The season saw the Giants attempting to improve on their 8\u20136 record from 1972. However, the Giants suffered one of the worst seasons in franchise history, winning only two games, while losing eleven, and tying one. The two wins were against the Houston Oilers and the St. Louis Cardinals while the tie was against archrival Philadelphia, in what turned out to be the last game the Giants would ever play at Yankee Stadium before playing their final five home games at the Yale Bowl in Connecticut. They moved to Shea Stadium in 1975 and to Giants Stadium in 1976.

Passage 1:It is widely believed that Saudi Arabia has been a major financier of Pakistan's own integrated atomic bomb project since 1974, a programme founded by former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. In the 1980s, Chief Martial Law Administrator and President General Zia-ul-Haq paid a state visit to Saudi Arabia where he unofficially told the King that: \"Our achievements are yours\". This cooperation was allegedly furthered by socialist prime minister Benazir Bhutto in 1995. In 1998, the conservative Prime minister Nawaz Sharif informed Saudi Arabia confidentially before ordering the nuclear tests (see Chagai-I and Chagai-II) in the Weapon-testing labs-III (WTL) located in the Chagai remote site in Balochistan Province of Pakistan. In June 1998, the Prime Minister paid a farewell visit to King Fahd and publicly thanked the Saudi government for supporting the country after the tests.

Having turned professional in 1990, Doherty has won a total of six ranking tournaments, including the 1997 World Snooker Championship in which he defeated Stephen Hendry, inflicting Hendry's first loss in a world final. This made him the first player, and so far one of only two (the other being Stuart Bingham) to have been world amateur and professional champion. The following year, he came very close to breaking the Crucible curse, reaching the 1998 final where he lost out to John Higgins. He reached a third final in 2003, in which he was defeated by Mark Williams. In other triple crown events, he is a three-time UK Championship runner-up and a two-time Masters runner-up.\n Passage 3:The LGBT movement has been very active in the new millennium. In the advent of the 2000s, more LGBT organizations were formed to serve specific needs, including sexual health (particularly HIV), psychosocial support, representation in sports events, religious and spiritual needs, and political representation. For example, the political party Ang Ladlad was founded by Danton Remoto, a renowned LGBT advocate, in 2003. The community has also shown their advocacies through the 21st LGBT Metro Manila Pride March held in Luneta Park on 27 June 2015, with the theme, \"Fight For Love:Iba-Iba. Sama-Sama\". This movement aims to remind the nation that the fight for LGBT rights is a fight for human rights. Advocates are calling on the Philippines to recognize the voices of people of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities. In present time, there remains no umbrella LGBT organization in the Philippines. Therefore, organizations tend to work independently of each other. Due to these divisions, there remains no prioritization of efforts, with organizations focusing on what they consider as important for them.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Septem possessed an heirloom bronze vessel with an eastern design, which was in fact the Monster Fusion Vessel. He had heterochromic pupils of blue and brown, garnering discrimination and distrust from his peers and fellow knights over his somewhat Eastern appearance. Miles (\u9ea5\u723e\u65af) (the reincarnation of Satan whose memories and innate powers had not yet been fully awakened), a knight-commander under the guidance of the cleric Cornelius (\u5eb7\u90a3\u91cc\u58eb) (the Dread Lord of Hell in disguise), was the polar opposite of his rival Septem, enforcing the Church's will without mercy and question, executing those designated as heretics without hesitation, and had the affection of Lilian (\u8389\u84ee), a pure maiden Septem had courted in vain. Pepin himself, however, favored Septem, and gave him a quest of great import. He was to go to the East, and find the way to achieve Absolute Victory/the Way of the King. During the journey, a simpleminded demoness named Nicole (\u59ae\u53ef) joined Septem after being summoned by a strange dying man Septem tried to help, as an agent sent by Satan. Her mission was to awaken Septem's memory of his past life, in which he was Lucifer's most trusted ally who took part in Lucifer's Rebellion, and to convert him to Satan's cause once more, accompanied with promises of wealth, power, and demonic servants, but she eventually abandoned her mission over the fondness she developed for Septem. Kama, a self-proclaimed spirit of love, and Ankh, a snarky talking flying Egyptian black cat accompanying Kama (both of whom Septem encountered in the Tadmor Tombs), as well as Li Jing (\u674e\u9756), a Chinese mortal-turned-deity who oversaw the establishment of the Tang dynasty, whose reincarnated self, Master Huiyan, previously accompanied Septem for a short time before sacrificing himself in an attempt to stop a war between the Abbasid Caliphate (which recently overthrew Umayyad rule) and Tang (which ended in the defeat of the Tang forces led by Gao Xianzhi), also joined the party. Septem also met his eventual wife, Widad (\u8587\u9054), a military leader who defied Arabian patriarchal traditions and who was the reincarnated spirit twin of Kama, and the young grandson of Al-Kindi, whom Septem studied under for a short time around the time of the Abbasid Revolution, as well as Wang Siyue (\u738b\u601d\u6708), a willful young woman from Chang'an with feelings for Septem, along his journey. After finally reaching China and encountering a variety of conflicts, including the An Lushan Rebellion, the group discovered Satan's plan to subjugate all worlds by using the Reversal of Mandala Ritual (\u53cd\u66fc\u9640\u7f85\u9663), which Septem's past incarnation invented and gained time traversal powers from, to modify the natural laws of causality, and managed to foil it with the assistance of The Immortal of Xuan-yuan Sword (the avatar of the Xuan-Yuan Sword who takes on the form of a stern and wise old man). After Satan's defeat, Septem married Widad, returned to assist Charlemagne with lessons from his journey-that a ruler must rule in the best interests of the commonfolk, and the way to ensure victory lies in the prevention and cessation of conflicts, and later reunited with Nicole, who was reborn once more as a normal girl by the grace of Heaven.\n Passage 3:Folliott Herbert Sandford, the son of a barrister, was born on 28 October 1906.

The Old Synagogue, now the King's School Music Room, is one of only two Egyptian Revival synagogues still standing. The city centre contains many timber-framed 16th and 17th century houses, however there are far fewer than there were before the Second World War, as many were damaged during the Baedeker Blitz. Many are still standing, including the \"Old Weaver's House\" used by the Huguenots. St Martin's Mill is the only surviving mill out of the six known to have stood in Canterbury.

In 2007, he directed the drama Paruthiveeran set in a village in Tamil Nadu, which marked the debut of Karthi, younger son of Sivakumar and brother of Suriya. Critics heaped high praise on the film and Ameer's direction, while Karthi as well as Priyamani, who performed the female lead, won several notable prizes for their performances. Paruthiveeran remains Ameer's most acclaimed work, having received six Filmfare Awards South including the Best Film and Best Director trophies, two National Film Awards, two Tamil Nadu State Film Awards and four Vijay Awards.

According to the song's official sheet music, published by Walt Disney Music Publishing on Musicnotes.com, \"Where the Dream Takes You\" is set in signature common time and performed at a moderate tempo of 88 beats per minute in the key of C major. The Disney Song Encyclopedia author Thomas S. Hischak believes that the song's lyrics are \"about following your heart to find your true self\", which begin \"They'll try to hold you back, they will say you're wrong, but they will never understand, no, the journey that you're on.\" A writer for Barnes & Noble agreed that, thematically, the single \"correlates to the film's tale of an inexperienced young adventurer\", Milo Thatch, and its diverse cast of supporting characters, all of whom long to follow various dreams of their own as they search for Atlantis. One of its verses reads, \"There's something in your soul/That won't be denied/It's the faith to dream that keeps the dream alive/So you still believe and you know you must go\", encouraging listeners to follow their dreams despite others' opinions. Lasting a duration of four minutes, AllMusic cites the song's mood as both \"earnest\" and \"mellow\"; M\u00fda performs it using a \"sweet vocal\", which spans two octaves from G3 to D\u266d5. Based on a melody heard only briefly during the film, \"Where the Dream Takes You\" encompasses \"soft, contemporary beats\" combined with the singer's \"dulcet tones\" that recall music played in a piano lounge, contrasting with the time period in which the film itself is set. Its production, which has been described as \"polished\", was handled by Jay Selvester, Robbie Buchanan and Ron Fair.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

He never fully recovered and died seven years later, on May 6, 1977.\n Passage 3:In response to a downturn in the arcade-game market in the early 1980s, Sega began to develop video game consoles\u2014starting with the SG-1000 and Master System\u2014but struggled against competing products such as the Nintendo Entertainment System. Around the same time, Sega executives David Rosen and Hayao Nakayama executed a management buyout of the company with backing from CSK Corporation. Sega released its next console, the Sega Genesis (known as the Mega Drive outside North America) in 1988. Although it initially struggled, the Genesis became a major success after the release of Sonic the Hedgehog in 1991. Sega's marketing strategy, particularly in North America, helped the Genesis outsell main competitor Nintendo and their Super Nintendo Entertainment System for four consecutive Christmas seasons in the early 1990s. While the Game Gear and Sega CD achieved less, Sega's arcade business was also successful into the mid 1990s.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

The evolution of Pure Land Buddhism caused raig\u014d-zu to be developed as a genre, characterised by depictions of the Amida welcoming the souls of the faithful to his Western Paradise as seen in a 1053 painting in the Phoenix-Hall of By\u014dd\u014d-in. By the mid-Heian period, Chinese style kara-e painting was replaced with the classical Japanese yamato-e style, in which the images were painted primarily on sliding screens and by\u014dbu folding screens. At the close of the Heian period around 1185, the practice of adorning emakimono hand scrolls with yamato-e paintings flourished. Examples of illustrated hand scrolls include novels such as Genji Monogatari Emaki, historical writings like The Tale of Great Minister Ban, or religious works such as the Scroll of Hungry Ghosts. These genres continued to be produced into the Kamakura period from 1185 to 1333.

According to Dave Simpson of The Guardian, the performance suggested that Berrabah \"could trigger an unlikely shift into soul\" for the group. The trio performed \"Caught in a Moment\" at the 100 Club, London on 3 October 2006 as part of a gig, which was in promotion of Overloaded: The Singles Collection. They performed the song as part of the Overloaded tour, and were seated on stools in the centre of the stage. With regard to their performance on 13 April 2007 at the Wembley Arena, London, Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy commented: \"Their epiphanic beauty was fully realised with the fragile, emotive nature of Heidi's voice and Keisha's powerful singing\". \"Caught in a Moment\" appeared in the set list for the group's 2008 Change Tour.

Olvir was the son of the viking Berle-Kari and brother-in-law of Kveldulf Bjalfason, who married Olvir's sister Salbjorg Karadottir; he was thus uncle to Skallagrim and Thorolf Kveldulfsson and great uncle to the famous poet Egil Skallagrimsson. Olvir also had a brother named Eyvind Lambi. Olvir was a prominent member of the court of King Harald Fairhair, who united Norway under his rule in the late ninth or early tenth century. Among other famous poets, he served as one of King Harald's court poets. He also served as a warrior in Harald's retinue, and fought at the pivotal Battle of Hafrsfjord on the king's flagship. He is best known for his involvement in the conflict between Harald and Olvir's kinsman Thorolf Kveldulfsson, which ended with the latter's death. Only a few fragments of Olvir's poetry survive.\n Passage 2:Specific attractions include the world's only complete collection of Vanwall cars, a near-complete collection of McLaren Formula One cars from the team's inception to the early 2000s, and extensive collections of Williams and BRM cars (including examples of both notorious BRM V16-powered machines as well as the H16-powered BRM P83). The collection also has examples of four different four-wheel drive Formula One cars, including an unraced Cosworth car. Another star exhibit is the Lotus 18 with which Stirling Moss won the 1961 Monaco Grand Prix, along with Jim Clark's World Championship-winning Lotus 25. Noticeable, however, is the distinct lack of Ferrari vehicles, 3 in all, but fine examples nonetheless. First being a Ferrari 312 driven by Chris Amon, second a 312B and thirdly, a Ferrari F2000 (The particular chassis driven to victory in the 2000 Canadian Grand Prix, one of nine victories for Michael Schumacher in his maiden championship winning series with Ferrari), conversely, the establishment houses the Jordan 191 in which he made his formula 1 debut in 1991.

S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan had collaborated on one previous opera, Thespis; or, The Gods Grown Old, in 1871. Although reasonably successful, it was a Christmas entertainment, and such works were not expected to endure. Between Thespis and Trial by Jury, Gilbert and Sullivan did not collaborate on any further operas, and each man separately produced works that further built his reputation in his own field. Gilbert wrote several short stories, edited the second volume of his comic Bab Ballads, and created a dozen theatrical works, including Happy Arcadia in 1872; The Wicked World, The Happy Land and The Realm of Joy in 1873; Charity, Topsyturveydom and Sweethearts in 1874. At the same time, Sullivan wrote various pieces of religious music, including the Festival Te Deum (1872) and an oratorio, The Light of the World (1873), and edited Church Hymns, with Tunes (1874), which included 45 of his own hymns and arrangements. Two of his most famous hymn tunes from this period are settings of \"Onward, Christian Soldiers\" and \"Nearer, my God, to Thee\" (both in 1872). He also wrote a suite of incidental music to The Merry Wives of Windsor (1874) and many parlour ballads and other songs, including three in 1874\u201375 with words by Gilbert: \"The Distant Shore\", \"Sweethearts\" (inspired by Gilbert's play) and \"The Love that Loves Me Not\".\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

His work, Church Window was recognized in the New York Times, and he moved away from portraits to recreate scenes that sparked memories of his childhood. He was most influenced by Andrew Wyeth and Edward Hopper. The Coe-Kerr Gallery of NYC and Whistler's Daughter Gallery of New Jersey represented him, as well as contemporaries Wyeth and Hopper. Malcolm Forbes, Frederick R. Koch, Stephen Sondheim, William Schuman, and Jean Shepherd held private collections of his work. He exhibited at Newark Museum and Trenton Art Museum in New Jersey, and in universities, galleries and museums in seven states by his mid-thirties. His work is part of the permanent collections of Seton Hall University and Newark Museum.

Later, Boris graduated from the Military School in Sofia, then took part in the Balkan Wars. During the First World War, he served as liaison officer of the General Staff of the Bulgarian Army on the Macedonian front. In 1916, he was promoted to colonel and attached again as liaison officer to Army Group Mackensen and the Bulgarian Third Army for the operations against Romania.

Goldenrod (Solidago virgaurea) is locally abundant amongst the heath communities growing on the podzolic soils on the higher parts of the islands. The heaths are classified as a poor fit somewhere between H10 and H11 and the heather (Calluna vulgaris), bell heather (Erica cinerea) and bracken merge into pure bracken on the lower slopes. A feasibility study is needed to decide if the vegetation would benefit from grazing through a Higher Level Stewardship (HLS) agreement. With no resident botanist, together with the difficulty of recording on remote islands, there are not many plant records and the number of species for each of the Eastern Isles was finally published in 1971 from surveys carried out by J D Grose, Mr & Mrs J E Dallas and J E Lousley in 1938 and 1939. Lousley listed 111 species of higher plants in his 1971 Flora, and by 1999 further surveys recorded a similar number (114). Some of the islands have species that are only found on that island and not on the other Eastern Isles such as an oak tree found by Mr and Mrs Dallas on Great Gannick. Possible ancient woodland indicators such as butcher's-broom (Ruscus aculeatus), wood spurge (Euphorbia amygdaloides) and wood small-reed (Calamagrostis epigejos) have also been recorded on Great Gannick.

In 1512, the Kingdom of Navarre was almost entirely occupied by Spain; only Lower Navarre, north of the Pyrenees escaped Spanish permanent occupation. The Bearnese monarchs extended the use of Occitan to Navarre after 1512, despite the fact that it was not the vernacular there, where Basque was the tongue of the people. The Estates of Navarre convoked in 1522 (or in 1523, according to other sources) kept records in Occitan, as did the Chancery of Navarre created in 1524.

The core trio from the Rockets, Danny Whitten, Billy Talbot, and Ralph Molina, provided instrumental backing for Young's 1969 album Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, and performed on some songs from Young's 1970 album After the Gold Rush. Producer/keyboardist Jack Nitzsche, who had been a member of Phil Spector's Wrecking Crew and played on records by The Rolling Stones, had worked with Young on his debut album and on tracks for Buffalo Springfield. He was drafted into Crazy Horse to back up Young on their short tour in early 1970.

Coffin tackled this problem by constructing a one-mile tramline which connected his mines in Dinas to a tramline built by Dr. Richard Griffiths at Denia (Pontypridd), which linked to a private canal that joined onto the Glamorganshire Canal at Treforest. Coffins tramline followed the southern bank of the River Rhondda and ran through Porth. The existence of the tramline made the development of the Porth and Cymmer region far more attractive, and by the middle of the 19th century there was an impetus to expand coal mining in the area. In 1841 Richard Lewis joined Coffin in trying to exploit the region with his level built at Cymmer. This resulted in the construction of around fifty miners' cottages, several of which were located in Porth. In 1844 Lewis Edwards of Newport and George Gethin of Penygraig opened a small level at Nyth-bran on the eastern borders of Porth, the villages' first coal mine. This was followed in 1845 by the sinking of the Porth Colliery by David James of Merthyr, the success of which saw him build the Llwyncelyn Colliery in 1951, also in Porth. By 1850 the Taff Vale Railway had been extended to Cymmer replacing the tramline, allowing direct access between the lower Rhondda and the ports of Cardiff.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Roosevelt bought a Ford Phaeton coupe and had it equipped with hand controls in direct contravention of a Secret Service directive prohibiting sitting presidents from getting behind the wheel of a car. In December 1939, President Roosevelt received a 1939 Lincoln Motor Company V12 convertible\u2014the Sunshine Special. The Sunshine Special (so named because the top was frequently open) became the president's best-known automobile, the very first to be built to Secret Service specifications, and the first to be leased rather than bought. Built on the chassis of the Lincoln K-series, the Sunshine Special has a wheelbase, room for 10 passengers, rear doors hinged backwards, heavy-duty suspension, two side-mounted spare tires, and standing platforms attached to the exterior to accommodate Secret Service agents. The Sunshine Special underwent two sets of modifications. Firstly in 1941 the car's top was lowered out of aesthetic concerns. Then, in 1942, after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the car underwent the addition of armor, bulletproof glass, \"metal-clad flat-proof inner tubes, a radio transceiver, a siren, red warning lights, and a compartment for submachine guns.\" After the second set of modifications, the car weighed and was longer.\n Passage 3:Un'y\u014d  was one of the ships dispatched to Ky\u016bsh\u016b in 1874 during the Saga Rebellion.

After they were rebuffed in these negotiations, the Japanese government again dispatched Un'y\u014d in September 1875 under the command of Inoue Yoshika to provoke a military response, in what was later termed the Ganghwa Island incident. This eventually led to the Treaty of Ganghwa, which opened the Korean Peninsula to Japanese trade. In 1876, Un'y\u014d  was assigned to assist in the suppression of the Hagi Rebellion, another uprising of disaffected former samurai.

The House of Bourbon would be another example because it continued to be recognized by other countries at the time as the legitimate government of France after it was overthrown by the populace during the French Revolution. This continued to last through the rule of Napoleon Bonaparte and the Napoleonic Wars from 1803\u201304 to 1815. With the spread of constitutional monarchy, monarchical governments which were exiled started to include a prime minister, such as the Dutch government during World War II headed by Pieter Sjoerds Gerbrandy.\n Passage 2:Woldenga's career started as a captain in the merchant marine.

After two and one-half years on active duty in the U.S. Naval Medical Corps, he joined the National Institutes of Health in 1954. He was Chief of the Developmental and Metabolic Neurology Branch in the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke from 1972 to 2006. Dr. Brady and his colleagues identified the enzymatic defects in Gaucher's disease, Niemann\u2013Pick disease, Fabry disease and the specific metabolic abnormality in Tay\u2013Sachs disease. He and his associates developed diagnostic, carrier detection, prenatal tests for these conditions, and effective enzyme replacement therapy for patients with Gaucher disease and Fabry disease. These were the first-ever enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) treatments for lysosomal diseases, and directly led to great advances in the development of enzyme replacement therapies for some of the other lysosomal diseases, by many different researchers who were inspired by Dr. Brady. (An international research and development effort for new ERT for several devastating lysosomal diseases continues today at an intense pace, and numerous ERT clinical trials are underway.)

Passage 1:Pope Pius X created him Cardinal Priest of Santa Maria sopra Minerva in the consistory of November 27, 1911. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 1914 papal conclave, which selected Pope Benedict XV. Following the outbreak of World War I, Farley stated, \"I would that peace could come by arbitration and diplomacy. It seems, however, that no permanent peace can be hoped for except through the defeat of German arms in the field or the repudiation of the Prussian autocracy by the German people themselves. Criticism of the government irritates me. I would consider it treason.\" He also said, \"As Catholics in America, we owe unswerving allegiance to the Government of the United States, and it is our sacred duty to answer with alacrity every demand our country makes upon our loyalty and devotion.\" His dedication to victory in the war angered the Sinn F\u00e9in element of the New York clergy, who believed the Cardinal was bowing to anti-Irish bigots.\n Passage 2:Born in Hill of Beath, Fife Durkin joined Edinburgh-based club Heart of Midlothian from local club Hill of Beath Ramblers in 1948, but did not make his Scottish Football League debut until 1951.

Passage 1:Denean Howard and her 3 sisters gained fame in 1979 when the four of them teamed up to set the National High School record in the 4x440 yard relay for San Gorgonio High School in San Bernardino. That distance is now rarely run as the NFHS converted to metric distances, so the record still stands today. Later teams with Denean broke the record for the slightly shorter 4x400 metres relay, after sister Atra graduated and the rest of the family moved to Kennedy High School (Los Angeles). Denean was the California High School Athlete of the Year at Kennedy in 1982, following in the footsteps of her sister Sherri. Also following her sister, she was named the national Girl's \"High School Athlete of the Year\" by Track and Field News, two years in a row. Her 1982 52.39 was the NFHS national high school record for eighteen years, before it was beaten by Monique Henderson. At age 15, she qualified for the ill-fated 1980 U.S. Olympic Team which was part of the 1980 Olympic Boycott finishing behind sister Sherri at the 1980 Olympic Trials, the first sisters to make the Olympic team simultaneously in the same event.\n Passage 2:The Tsardom of Russia had been experiencing the Time of Troubles (1598\u20131613) since the death of Tsar Feodor I in 1598, causing widespread political instability and a violent succession crisis for the title of Tsar of Russia by usurpers known as the False Dmitris. In 1605, the Polish-Muscovite War started when the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth unofficially invaded Russia in support of False Dmitry I against the unpopular crowned tsar Boris Godunov, seeking to exploit the country's weakness for their own gain. Godunov died in June 1605 and was replaced by False Dmitry I, whose popularity among the Russian populace declined rapidly during his reign, and the Polish withdrew when he was eventually murdered during an uprising in Moscow in May 1606. \n Passage 3:Emmanuel was born on 2 March 1989 in Southend-on-Sea, a seaside resort town in Essex, England. Emmanuel is the second child of a half Dominican (Dominiquais) and half English mother, and a father of half-Saint Lucian and half English descent. Emmanuel demonstrated an affinity for the arts at an early age; she recalled that her mother first took notice of her passion and desire to become an actress during Emmanuel's attendance at the independent St Hilda's School (now closed) and later grammar Westcliff High School for Girls. In an interview with the New York Daily News, she commented, \"When I was 3, [I'd] always cause drama that my mum decided maybe I should channel it properly\u2014so she started me on acting, singing and dancing classes\".

His next role was Cymon in Michael Arne's opera. In a busy first year he was well-received, appearing in various roles, and made his place alongside many well-established performers. 'On the removal of the elder Bannister to the Royalty Theatre, Dignum succeeded to a caste of parts more suited to his person and his voice, which was a fine tenor. Amongst other characters those of Hawthorn' (Love in a Village) 'and Giles' (The Maid of the Mill) (libretti by Isaac Bickerstaffe, 1762 and 1765 respectively) 'particularly suited him: indeed he was thought superior in them to any actor that had appeared since the days of John Beard, their original representative.' Dignum was the original performer of Crop the miller, in Stephen Storace's No song, no supper, and of Abdalla in Storace's Dido, Queen of Carthage. He was also well known as Tom Tug in Dibdin's The Waterman, in which role there is an illustration of him in the Garrick Club.\n Passage 2:In 1998, Henderson moved to Scotland where he had unsuccessful trials with several team.

Passage 1:Za\u00efre was soon translated into English by Aaron Hill as Zara: A Tragedy. Following its successful run at London's Drury Lane Theatre in 1736, Zara became the most frequently staged English adaptation of a Voltaire play. Famous English actresses who have played the title role include Susannah Maria Cibber, who made her stage debut in the 1736 Drury Lane production, Sarah Siddons, and Elizabeth Younge. The first known professional performance of the play in the American Colonies was in Philadelphia on 26 December 1768, performed by the Hallam Company using the Aaron Hill version. The company took the play to New York City in 1769 and after the end of the Revolutionary War sporadically revived it there and in Philadelphia. The first professional performances after the hostilities ended were given in Baltimore in April 1782 by the Thomas Wall Company. Although the professional theatres were closed during the War, the play proved popular with the British Army. General Burgoyne, himself a playwright, produced Zara with military actors in British-occupied Boston in 1775 and four times in occupied New York between 1780 and 1781.\n Passage 2:The wintering migrant birds which flock to the sanctuary were recorded at different periods during the winter months.

Passage 1:John Mitchel, the most committed advocate of revolution, had been arrested early in 1848, then convicted on the purposefully\u2013created charge of Treason-felony. He was sentenced to transportation to Bermuda, where he joined other convicts labouring on the construction of the Royal Naval Dockyard on Ireland Island. He was subsequently sent to Van Diemen's Land (in present-day Tasmania, Australia) where he was soon to be joined by other leaders, such as William Smith O'Brien and Thomas Francis Meagher who had both been arrested after Ballingarry. John Blake Dillon escaped to France, as did three of the younger members, James Stephens, John O'Mahony and Michael Doheny. Meagher and John Mitchel (who had been transported there before for political activities) both managed to escape and emigrate to the United States in the early 1850s.

On her next patrol, the submarine attacked two Italian convoys, sinking an Italian destroyer in the second attack. Based in Algiers, the boat operated north of Sicily, sinking six Italian ships, including two tankers and two heavy merchant ships. Splendid was detected by a German destroyer on 21 April 1943 while patrolling off Naples, Italy; the submarine was attacked with depth charges by the destroyer and forced to surface, after which she was scuttled and her surviving crew members taken prisoner.

The Bulldogs' faced off against local rival Eastern Washington University at the arena in four consecutive years (2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005), each won by the Zags, but just like with the Cougars, the rivalry has gone dormant due to the rise of the Zags' program to major status since the late 1990s, while the Cougars and Eagles have not seen much national spotlight. Washington State has often hosted home games at the Spokane Arena as a part of its Pac-12 Conference men's basketball schedule, holding a 7\u20139 against conference foes in the arena, facing UCLA (1996 and 2004), Oregon (1997 and 2011), Oregon State (1997, 2011, and 2017), Arizona (1998, 2001, and 2006), Washington (1999), USC (2000 and 2004), Stanford (2004), California (2005), and Colorado (2014). With Gonzaga's rise to prominence, the Zags were able to bring high major schools like Washington (1998), Georgia (2003), Memphis (2007, 2009, and 2011) and Oklahoma (2009) to the Spokane Arena, with the Gonzaga holding a 2\u20133 record in those matchups, but with conference realignment and the West Coast Conference's additions of BYU (2011) and Pacific (2013), the Zags have been more selective and limited in their scheduling with four less matchups in their non-conference schedule, so they have only played in the Spokane Arena once since 2012.\n Passage 3:Ohloblyn traced his ancestry to the Novgorod-Siversky region of Left-bank Ukraine, which had formed an important part of the autonomous Ukrainian \"Hetmanate\" in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and throughout his professional career as a historian retained a lively interest in this area and wrote frequently about it. Educated at the universities in Kiev, Odessa, and Moscow, from 1921 to 1933 he taught history at the Kiev Institute of People's Education (as Kiev University was known after the revolution), but during Joseph Stalin's purges, was dismissed from his posts, forced to recant his allegedly \"bourgeois nationalist\" views, and suffered repression including several months of imprisonment. In the late 1930s he returned to teaching at Kiev and Odessa universities. When the Germans occupied Kiev in the fall of 1941, Ohloblyn was appointed head of the Kiev Municipal Council, a post which he held from September 21 to October 25, and was a member of the Ukrainian National Council which tried to organize Ukrainian life under the difficult conditions of the occupation. He desperately tried to save from execution some of Jews he knew but the German commandant of Kiev informed him that \"the Jewish issue belongs to exclusive jurisdiction of Germans and they will solve it at their own discretion\" (, in Russian). Politics under the Nazis was not to his taste and he quickly retired from his public positions and returned to his scholarly work. In 1942 he worked as a director of Kiev Museum-Archive of Transitional Period, whose exhibition compared life under Bolsheviks and under Germans. In 1943 he moved to Lviv in western Ukraine and in 1944 to Prague. Upon the approach of the Red Army, he fled west to Bavaria. From 1946 to 1951, he taught at the Ukrainian Free University in Munich. In 1951, he moved to the United States where he was active in various Ukrainian emigre scholarly institutions such as the Ukrainian Academy of Arts and Sciences in the US and the Ukrainian Historical Association.

He founded the International Submarine Band in 1966, but the group disbanded prior to the 1968 release of its debut album, Safe at Home. Parsons joined The Byrds in early 1968 and played a pivotal role in the making of the seminal Sweetheart of the Rodeo album. After leaving the group in late 1968, Parsons and fellow Byrd Chris Hillman formed The Flying Burrito Brothers in 1969; the band released its debut, The Gilded Palace of Sin, the same year. The album was well received but failed commercially. After a sloppy cross-country tour, the band hastily recorded Burrito Deluxe. Parsons was fired from the band before the album's release in early 1970. Emmylou Harris assisted him on vocals for his first solo record, GP, released in 1973. Although it received enthusiastic reviews, the release failed to chart. His next album, Grievous Angel, peaked at number 195 on the Billboard chart.

During the 1950s, she recorded a number of tracks for Aladdin Records, including in 1953 the first version of \"Dial That Telephone\", a comedic monologue in which she complains to a friend about the absence of her husband. She also recorded with Ike Carpenter's orchestra. In 1955 and 1956, she recorded several tracks including \"Champagne Mind With A Soda Water Income\" with the Squires, a vocal group featuring Don Harris and Dewey Terry (later Don and Dewey). She recorded several versions of \"Dial That Telephone\" over the years, including a 1959 version released on Criner's Spot record label. However, the song only became a chart success in 1965, when a new recording on the Duo Disc label reached #36 on the Billboard R&B chart. In 1968, her recording of \"Harper Valley P.T.A.

Passage 1:Thomas Bonham had been admitted to St John's College, Cambridge, in 1581. Earning a bachelor's degree in 1584, he completed a master's by 1588 and studied for a medical doctorate at Cambridge, which was later granted by the University of Oxford. By 1602, he had completed his studies and moved to London, where he practised medicine and associated himself with the Barber-Surgeons' Company, campaigning for it to be allowed to authorise medical practitioners in a similar way to the College of Physicians. Apparently giving up after a failed petition to Parliament in 1605, Bonham petitioned to join the college on 6 December 1605 but was rejected and told to return after further study. Returning on 14 April 1606, he was again told he could not join and was fined \u00a35 () and threatened with imprisonment for continuing to practise. Bonham still kept working as a doctor; on 3 October it was announced he was to be arrested and fined \u00a310. Bonham again appeared before the college, now with a lawyer, on 7 November. He announced that he would continue to practise without seeking the college's permission, which he claimed had no power over graduates of Oxford or Cambridge.

Bachata #1's, Vol. 2 was released on August 12, 2008. \"Mi Corazoncito\", written by Anthony \"Romeo\" Santos and performed by Aventura, was released as the third and final single from the group's second live album, K.O.B. Live (2006). The song peaked at number fifteen on the Billboard Latin Pop Songs and number two on the Billboard Latin Songs charts, topping both the Billboard Tropical Songs and Billboard Latin Rhythm Songs charts, while an additional live version peaked at number ten on the Billboard Tropical Songs chart. The bachata-infused-R&B number, has been named one of their biggest hits along with \"Los Infieles\", \"Un Beso\", and \"El Perdedor\" among others. Xtreme's \"Mientes\" is originally from the duo's second studio album Haciendo Historia (2006), which also featured the gorup's R&B-leaning hit single \"Shorty, Shorty\". Puerto Rican Latin pop singer Luis Fonsi performs \"Con Las Manos Vac\u00edas\", a track exclusive to this release. \"Tengo Un Amor\" was written by Toby Love with additional composition by Edwin Perez who also handled production for the song. The song was written with Spanglish lyrics combining crunk hip hop with bachata. David Jefferies, while reviewing the parent album, called the song \"an incredibly smooth, lush, and glittery ballad\" while listing the song as a selected \"Allmusic Pick\". According to Billboard, the original version of the song is a \"straightforward bachata song\" while the remix, which is included on this release, with R.K.M & Ken-Y, known then as Rakim & Ken-Y provides \"urban street cred\".\n Passage 3:Tony met Deep Purple in the early 1970s, when the last recording of Ashton, Gardner and Dyke was a collaboration with keyboardist Jon Lord on the soundtrack for a b-movie called The Last Rebel.

Passage 1:His grandfather was architect Alexandros Tzonis who designed many buildings in Thessaloniki during the Interwar period. Tzonis studied architecture at the National Technical University of Athens (1956 -1961). During the period of his university studies, he was instructed privately in mathematics (Pandelis Rokos) and art (Spyros Papaloukas) meeting regularly with the architect Dimitris Pikionis who was by then retired from teaching. He worked professionally as a stage designer in the theatre and art director in the cinema. (Never on Sunday, 1960 directed by Jules Dassin). In 1961 he moved to the United States as a Ford Fellow, where he pursued his studies at Yale University, briefly in the Drama School and soon after in the School of Art and Architecture under Paul Rudolph, Shadrach Woods, Robert Venturi, and Serge Chermayeff. In 1965, with sponsorship from the Twentieth Century Fund he was appointed fellow at Yale where he carried out pioneering research on Planning and Design Methodology in collaboration with Chermayeff with whom he co-authored The Shape of Community (1972). In 1968 he was invited to teach at the Graduate School of Design at Harvard University by Jerzy Soltan and Josep Lluis Sert appointed assistant professor. There he taught and did advanced research in analytical design methods in association with Walter Isard and Ovadia Salama, receiving outside advice from Anatol Rapaport and Seymour Papert. In collaboration with Ovadia Salama, introducing the newly developed method ELECTRE he worked out a new method for multi-criteria evaluation of architectural projects (1975). In collaboration with Michael Freeman, Etienne de Cointet, and his undergraduate student Robert Berwick, who became later professor of computational linguistics at MIT, he developed a method for design discourse analysis applied to the case of 17th and 18th century texts of French architectural theory, a project funded by the French Government carried out at Harvard and in France (1975).\n Passage 2:In 1870, Charles F. Dowd proposed four time zones based on the meridian through Washington, DC for North American railroads. In 1872. he revised his proposal to base it on the Greenwich meridian. Sandford Fleming, a Scottish-born engineer operating in Canada, proposed worldwide Standard Time at a meeting of the Royal Canadian Institute on February 8, 1879. Cleveland Abbe advocated standard time to better coordinate international weather observations and resultant weather forecasts, which had been coordinated using local solar time. In 1879 he recommended four time zones across the contiguous United States, based upon Greenwich Mean Time. The General Time Convention (renamed the American Railway Association in 1891), an organization of US railroads charged with coordinating schedules and operating standards, became increasingly concerned that if the US government adopted a standard time scheme it would be disadvantageous to its member railroads. William F. Allen, the Convention secretary, argued that North American railroads should adopt a five-zone standard, similar to the one in use today, to avoid government action. On October 11, 1883, the heads of the major railroads met in Chicago at the Grand Pacific Hotel and agreed to adopt Allen's proposed system.\n Passage 3:At the time, the Turkish Minister of Family and Social Policies, Fatma Bet\u00fcl Sayan Kaya, was touring Germany. A visit to the Dutch town of Hengelo, close to the German border, had already been scheduled. On 11 March, the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service received information that Kaya would try to reach Rotterdam by car. She could freely cross the border because of the Schengen Treaty. A crisis centre was established on the twenty-third floor of the Rotterdam World Port Center to coordinate police actions. Earlier, the Turkish consul in Rotterdam had indicated to the Mayor of Rotterdam, Ahmed Aboutaleb, that there were no plans for such a visit. It now proved impossible to contact the consul, which gave Aboutaleb the conviction that the consul knew of Kaya's attempt. A motorcade was intercepted but the car with the minister managed to drive away. It reached a small yard at the rear of the Turkish consulate. The Dutch police stopped Bet\u00fcl Sayan Kaya's entourage just metres from the Turkish consulate building. About twenty police officers, forming a special forces unit, the Dienst Speciale Interventies, masked and equipped with body armour and automatic weapons, arrested ten members of Kaya's bodyguard, on suspicion of illegally carrying firearms. A German source had indicated they had obtained a German weapons permit. No arms were discovered. Two other men were also arrested, who later proved to be the Deventer Turkish consul and the charg\u00e9 d'affaires of the Turkish embassy. They in principle enjoyed diplomatic immunity. The twelve arrested men were detained for two hours and their passports were seized. A stand-off ensued for several hours in which the Turkish minister refused to leave the car. Just after midnight, a special heavy tow truck, a lift flatbed, was driven into the yard and prepared to vertically hoist the 3.5 tonne car onto the flatbed, with the minister still in it, to transport her back to Germany. The minister now left the car and demanded entrance to the consulate invoking the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. The Dutch police had orders to arrest the minister if necessary. Ultimately, she gave in to the police demands to leave the country. At the time, many news sources assumed that she had been declared persona non grata. She was, loudly protesting, taken to another car, a black armoured Mercedes, by masked Dutch police officers who accompanied her to a police station at Nijmegen near the Dutch\u2013German border. Her passport was seized. She was not allowed to leave the station for one and a half hours, while being reunited with the ten bodyguards. She returned to Germany under German escort. Sporadic rioting occurred among the about a thousand pro-Erdo\u011fan protesters who had come to the Turkish consulate. They were met by Dutch riot police, who arrested twelve people for violent assault and not following police instructions. Kaya's passport was returned on 12 March, 18:00, to the Turkish consul. In April 2017, Kaya's lawyer said they would file a complaint against the Dutch government at court claiming that her expulsion from the Netherlands was illegal because she was not given a written statement of the reasons for the expulsion. However, on 2 May the case was dropped when it transpired that Kaya had never been formally declared persona non grata and that from a judicial point of view she had left the Netherlands voluntarily.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

The building was significantly reworked in 1912 to accommodate the jewellery store. The rework added distinctive Renaissance Revival palace facades designed by Percy Nobbs, featuring terracotta, granite, bronze and Tyndall stone. Above the third-floor openings are six terracotta medallions depicting the sources of the materials used by jewellers, with a seventh medallion on the north facade. These medallions depict turquoise (representing semi-precious stones), an elephant (representing ivory), a Kimberley Negro] searching for diamonds, a man diving for pearls, an oceanic wave delivering the riches of the sea (mother-of-pearl, coral and a tortoise shell), a precious metal-smelting gnome, and a silversmith surrounded by the tools of his trade.

He was working with Irwin on a book about the wine country. He was particularly alert for a photo opportunity that day, since a storm had just passed over and other recent winter rains had left the area especially green. Driving along the Sonoma Highway (California State Route 12 and 121) he saw the hill, free of the vineyards that normally covered the area; they had been pulled out a few years earlier following a phylloxera infestation. \"There it was! My God, the grass is perfect! It's green! The sun is out; there's some clouds,\" he remembered thinking. He stopped somewhere near the Napa\u2013Sonoma county line and pulled off the road to set his Mamiya RZ67 medium-format camera on a tripod, choosing Fujifilm's Velvia, a film often used among nature photographers and known to saturate some colors. O'Rear credits that combination of camera and film for the success of the image. \"It made the difference and, I think, helped the 'Bliss' photograph stand out even more,\" he said. \"I think that if I had shot it with 35 mm, it would not have nearly the same effect.\" While he was setting up his camera, he said it was possible that the clouds in the picture came in. \"Everything was changing so quickly at that time.\" He took four shots and got back into his truck. According to O'Rear, the image was not digitally enhanced or manipulated in any way.\n Passage 3:New York played a pivotal role during the American Revolution and subsequent war. The Stamp Act Congress in 1765 brought together representatives from across the Thirteen Colonies to form a unified response to British policies. The Sons of Liberty were active in New York City to challenge British authority. After a major loss at the Battle of Long Island, the Continental Army suffered a series of additional defeats that forced a retreat from the New York City area, leaving the strategic port and harbor to the British army and navy as their North American base of operations for the rest of the war. The Battle of Saratoga was the turning point of the war in favor of the Americans, convincing France to formally ally with them. New York's constitution was adopted in 1777, and strongly influenced the United States Constitution. New York City was the national capital at various times between 1785 and 1790, where the Bill of Rights was drafted. Albany became the permanent state capital in 1797.

In the first chapter, Fisher considers the nature of inheritance, rejecting blending inheritance, because it would eliminate genetic variance, in favour of particulate inheritance. The second chapter introduces Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection. The third considers the evolution of dominance, which Fisher believed was strongly influenced by modifiers.

It was rebuilt again, with a wide roof covering the nave and the south aisle. In 1714 a belfry was built on the porch, and galleries were added in the middle of the 18th\u00a0century. The church was restored in 1869\u201374 by Joseph Clarke.\n Passage 3:The NFL's Steelers played home games at Forbes Field from their 1933 inception to 1957. They first played at Pitt Stadium in 1942, in an exhibition match for U.S.O. charity against the Fort Knox \"Armoraiders\" on November 15. From 1958 to 1963, the Steelers split home games between Forbes Field and Pitt Stadium. Fans were able to purchase season ticket packages for one site or the other. In 1964, the Steelers began to play home games exclusively at Pitt Stadium, which they continued until moving to the new Three Rivers Stadium in 1970. Of historic note, the iconic photo of New York Giants quarterback Y. A. Tittle, helmet-less, bloodied and kneeling, was taken at Pitt Stadium in 1964 following a Giants' loss to the Steelers on September 20. The photo, taken by Pittsburgh Post-Gazette photographer Morris Berman, now hangs in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:Roxas' first appearances were cameos in Another Side, Another Story, a bonus trailer found in Kingdom Hearts, and in the ending of . In Kingdom Hearts II, Roxas is introduced as a boy living in a computer simulation of a city called Twilight Town. Unaware of the virtual nature of the city, Roxas begins to dream about the adventures of Sora, the series' protagonist. He later encounters Axel, a member of Organization XIII who is under orders to extract him, and Namin\u00e9, a Nobody who tells him he is Sora's other half. Shortly after meeting DiZ, the creator of the virtual world, Roxas learns the true nature of Twilight Town, and that DiZ altered his memory and personality to mislead his pursuers from the Organization until he can merge with Sora. DiZ leads Roxas to an old mansion where he rejoins a sleeping Sora, allowing him to wake up. Sora later learns that Roxas is his Nobody, created during the events of the first game after briefly turning into a Heartless, and inducted into the Organization for his ability to capture hearts with the Keyblade; however, Roxas later betrayed the Organization and encountered one of Sora's friends, Riku, who captured him to restore Sora. Roxas makes two appearances near the end of the game: the first is in a mental battle with Sora depicted as a cut-scene, and the second is with Namin\u00e9, who has merged with her other self, Kairi. In the re-released version of the title, Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix, Roxas' fight against Sora is expanded, making him a boss character. The battle was meant to be interactive in Kingdom Hearts II, but time constraints imposed from creating fights for the other Organization XIII members prevented its inclusion. With the opportunity to include the fight, Nomura's team worked hard to make it entertaining for players. Additional scenes about Roxas' past were included in the game to add to the mystery around him.\n Passage 2:Hoadley made his first-class debut for Sussex against Warwickshire in the 1975 County Championship. He made six further first-class appearances for the county, the last of which came against Kent in the 1976 County Championship. In his seven first-class matches, he scored a total of 202 runs at an average of 18.36, with a high score of 58. This score was one of two fifties he made and came against Hampshire in 1975. Hoadley also made three List A appearances for Sussex in the 1975 John Player League against Warwickshire, Nottinghamshire and Kent. He scored just 13 runs at an average of 6.50, with a high score of 8 in these three matches.\n Passage 3:The Terrapins won the 1951 Southern Conference co-championship alongside the Virginia Military Institute. Their perfect season culminated with an upset over first-ranked Tennessee in the . At the time, however, the wire services released their final rankings before the bowl games, and Maryland finished third in the Associated Press Poll. Several selectors, including analyst Jeff Sagarin, have retroactively credited Maryland with the national championship. In 1953, Maryland and six other schools split from the Southern Conference to form the Atlantic Coast Conference. That year, Maryland shut-out two 11th-ranked teams: Mississippi, 38\u20130, and Alabama, 21\u20130, won the ACC co-championship alongside Duke, and were named the national champions as the only undefeated and untied team in the nation.

On the death of his father on 30 July 1680 he became Baron Butler in the English peerage and Earl of Ossory by courtesy. He obtained command of a cavalry regiment in Ireland in 1683, and having received an appointment at court on the accession of James II, he served against the Duke of Monmouth at the Battle of Sedgemoor in July 1685. Having succeeded his grandfather as Duke of Ormonde on 21 July 1688, he was appointed a Knight of the Order of the Garter on 28 September 1688. In 1688 he also became Chancellor of Trinity College, Dublin and Chancellor of the University of Oxford.\n Passage 2:Snyder was born in Kankakee, Illinois, the daughter of Idelle (Bonham) and John Marshall Snyder, Sr., a director of research. She opened in Jules Feiffer's comedy, Knock Knock, and went on to win the Clarence Derwent Award for the \"most promising female [actor] on the metropolitan scene\" for the 1975\u201376 season.

The ship was laid down at HM Dockyard, Portsmouth on 29 November 1909. She was launched on 20 August 1910, and was commissioned on 2 January 1912. Including her armament, her cost is variously quoted at \u00a31,855,917 or \u00a31,918,773. Orion was assigned to the 2nd division of the Home Fleet as the flagship of Rear-Admiral Sir Herbert King-Hall, the division's second-in-command. The ship was slightly damaged on 7 January when the pre-dreadnought battleship broke loose from her moorings and collided with Orions bow. The division was redesignated as the 2nd Battle Squadron (BS) on 1 May. The ship, together with her sister ships and , participated in the Parliamentary Naval Review on 9 July at Spithead. They then participated in training manoeuvres. King-Hall was relieved by Rear-Admiral Rosslyn Wemyss on 29 October. On 13 November, the ship participated in comparative gunnery trials with Thunderer to evaluate the effectiveness of the latter's gunnery director. Thunderer decisively outshot Orion, although some of her success was because her director was above the smoke that obscured the target from Orions guns. The test was repeated in better conditions on 4 December and Orion performed much better, apparently beating Thunderer. The three sisters were present with the 2nd BS to receive the President of France, Raymond Poincar\u00e9, at Spithead on 24 June 1913 and then participated in the annual fleet manoeuvres in August. Wemyss was relieved in his turn by Rear-Admiral Sir Robert Arbuthnot, 4th Baronet on 28 October. Captain Frederic Dreyer assumed command of Orion that same day. On 4 November, Orion, Thunderer, the dreadnought and the predreadnought fired at and sank the target ship to give their crews experience in firing live ammunition against a real ship.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:In the Republic of India, a governor is the constitutional head of each of the twenty-eight states. The governor is appointed by the President of India for a term of five years, and holds office at the President's pleasure. The governor is de jure head of the state government; all its executive actions are taken in the governor's name. However, the governor must act on the advice of the popularly elected council of ministers, headed by the chief minister, which thus holds de facto executive authority at the state-level. The Constitution of India also empowers the governor to act upon his or her own discretion, such as the ability to appoint or dismiss a ministry, recommend President's rule, or reserve bills for the President's assent. Over the years, the exercise of these discretionary powers have given rise to conflict between the elected chief minister and the union government\u2013appointed governor.\n Passage 2:The Poles are the most numerous of the West Slavs and occupy what some believe to be the original homeland of the Slavic peoples. While other groups migrated, the Polanie remained in situ along the Vistula, from the river's sources to its estuary at the Baltic Sea. There is no other European nation centred to such an extent on one river. The establishment of a Polish state is often identified with the adoption of Christianity by Mieszko I in 966 CE (see Baptism of Poland), when the state covered territory similar to that of present-day Poland. In 1025 CE, Poland became a kingdom. In 1569, Poland cemented a long association with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by signing the Union of Lublin, forming the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth was one of the largest and most populous countries in 16th- and 17th-century Europe.\n Passage 3:KJ Noons is hapa kanaka, hapa haole\u2014mixed ethnicity of native Hawaiian (from his mother's side) and European-American (from his father's side). Born and raised in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, Noons comes from a family history of fighting. His father Karl was a professional kickboxer and was a top contender during the time he fought. Karl's passion for fighting and competing in combat sports influenced him to introduce his son to martial arts at a young age. At the age of five, Noons started training in Kenp\u014d Karate. Often getting disqualified for fighting too hard in karate tournaments, Noons eventually started training in boxing and Muay Thai at the age of eight out of interest for full contact fighting. Noons competed as an amateur fighter and became the first student in the state of Hawaii to earn a junior black belt under Ed Parker at the age of 11. During his high school years, Noons moved to Houston, Texas due to the location of his father's job. While continuing to compete as a fighter, he also started playing football at Clements High School. At age 17, Noons won the ISKA Super Middleweight International Championship as an amateur in Sanshou. After winning the title and graduating from Clements High School, K.J. decided to pursue a career in combat sports, rather than go to college and continue with football.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

The Croats fought an increasing number of battles and gradually lost increasing swathes of territory to the Ottoman Empire. Ottoman conquests led to the 1493 Battle of Krbava field and 1526 Battle of Moh\u00e1cs, both ending in decisive Ottoman victories. King Louis II died at Moh\u00e1cs, and in November 1526, a Hungarian parliament elected J\u00e1nos Szapolyai as the new king of Hungary. In December 1526, another Hungarian parliament elected Ferdinand Habsburg as King of Hungary. On the other side, the Croatian Parliament met in Cetin and chose Ferdinand I of the House of Habsburg as new ruler of Croatia, under the condition that he provide protection to Croatia against the Ottoman Empire while respecting its political rights. A few years later both crown would be again united in Habsburgs hands and the union would be restored. The Ottoman Empire further expanded in the 16th century to include most of Slavonia, western Bosnia (then called Turkish Croatia) and Lika. Ottoman Croatia initially was part of Rumelia Eyalet, and later was parts of Budin Eyalet, Bosnia Eyalet and Kanije Eyalet.\n Passage 2:Somuncu Baba is one of the virtuous men who came to Anadolu for spiritual conquest, he was also a descendant of Islamic prophet Muhammad After receiving an education in cities which are the center of knowledge like \u015eam, Tabriz, Erdebil, he settled in Bursa for his guidance and duty. He taught at the Bursa Grand Mosque where he was installed by Sultan Bayezid I after it was completed. For hiding his spiritual side, he baked bread and sold them so he was known as Somuncu Baba. He became known after he had translated the sura of Al-Fatiha, in seven different ways during the opening of Bursa Grand Mosque, in Bursa.

As part of the deal, Carshalton played host to Stevenage in a friendly in July 2011. Harrison played his first game for the club shortly after, starting in Stevenage's 1\u20130 away loss to Gillingham. He scored his first goal for Stevenage in the club's 3\u20130 home win against Rotherham United on 25 January 2011, scoring just three minutes after coming on as a substitute to give Stevenage a two-goal lead. A week later, in his next game, Harrison scored twice in Stevenage's 2\u20132 draw with Gillingham. Harrison scored his fourth goal in as many games in another 2\u20132 draw, scoring the first goal of the game against Accrington Stanley with a looping shot from outside the area.

Sherman's forces in Vicksburg, Mississippi, and under the command of Brigadier General A.J. Smith. Smith's forces were available to Banks only until the end of April, when they would be sent back east where they were needed for other Union military actions. Banks would command this combined force of 35,000, which would be supported in its march up the Red River towards Shreveport by Union Navy Rear Admiral David Dixon Porter's fleet of gunboats. At the same time, 7,000 Union troops from the Department of Arkansas under the command of Major General Frederick Steele would be sent south from Arkansas to rendezvous with Banks in his attack on Shreveport, and to serve as the garrison for that city after its capture.\n Passage 2: November 1915, von Brincken married again to the San Francisco socialite Milo Abercrombie (1895-1977). Born in Houston, Texas, Milo was the niece of John W. Abercrombie, U.S. congressman from Alabama and acclaimed by noted portraitist Harrison Fisher as \"California's greatest beauty\". They had two children, Wilhelm Friedrich (1918-1980) and Maria A. (1917-2010). She divorced von Brincken in 1919 during his imprisonment and legally changed her and their two children's last name back to her maiden name, Abercrombie, so her children would not be \"ashamed\" of their name. Despite the divorce, von Brincken remained devoted to his former wife and she was able to remarry again, thanks to him. When the Roman Catholic Church forbade Abercrombie's intended marriage to U.S. Navy lieutenant Lyman K. Swenson, due to her divorce, von Brincken came forth and disclosed his earlier marriage to Alice Roedel. As both Roedel and von Brincken were Catholic, that marriage was sanctioned by the Church. Thus, the Church did not recognize von Brincken's later marriage to Abercrombie. Abercrombie and Swenson, who had both refused to marry unless it was sanctioned by the Catholic Church were then free to wed. Abercrombie and Swenson were married on August 11, 1920 by Father John Byrne at St Mary's Cathedral in San Francisco. At the wedding dinner that night, von Brincken's young son with Abercrombie, referred to as \"John\" and \"Buster\" in the press, was a \"guest of honor\" and toasted by his new stepfather and the officers of the submarine H-6 that he commanded, pledging, \"the little chap's future to the uniform of blue.\" Swenson and Abercrombie had two children, Lyman K. Jr. (\"Robert\") and Cecilia. Abercrombie obtained an interlocutory decree of divorce from Swenson in May 1925, with the final decree a year later. Several months later, in October 1925, the newspapers speculated that Abercrombie would marry another naval officer, Lieutenant Commander Hugo W. Koehler, reputed to be the \"wealthiest officer\" in the Navy. The third generation of a wealthy St. Louis brewery family, Koehler had been a naval intelligence and U.S. State Department spy in South Russia during the Russian Revolution. Swenson had introduced Milo Abercrombie to Koehler in Honolulu. Koehler was in Panama with his ship, USS West Virginia (BB-48) when he read a newspaper account that he was engaged to marry Milo Abercrombie. Brushing it off, Koehler curtly told the press, \"Some error,\" while Abercrombie did not take it so lightly. \"I have been deeply humiliated\", she told reporters, her eyes \"wet with tears\". \"This is a most unkind blow of fate. I cannot possibly understand how this false rumor got about.\" Two years later, Koehler married Matilda Pell, the ex-wife of U.S. Congressman Herbert Pell (D-NY) and mother of future United States Senator Claiborne Pell (D-RI). In a bitter child visitation court battle in 1927 that went all the way to the California Court of Appeals, Abercrombie lost custody of her children with Swenson to him, after making baseless accusations that he had molested their four-year old daughter, Cecelia. The appellate court excoriated Abercrombie, \"[I]in furtherance of a manifest determination to prevent him from ever seeing the children again, under any circumstances, she was instrumental in inspiring and promoting a scheme directly involving one of the children which had for its obvious purpose the ruination of respondent's character as a man, the bringing about of his complete disgrace as a naval officer, and the destruction of the love and affection which his children had theretofore manifested toward him.\" Swenson v. Swenson\" (1929) 101 Cal.App. 440. In 1929, Lyman Swenson married Loretta B. Bruner (1897-1979). His son, Lyman K.

The passage was marked by extremely bad weather and constant squalls and gales. As the fleet sailed out on the Atlantic, passing the Bay of Biscay on their way to England, the weather worsened and storms gradually pushed the ships off their planned course. Finally, on the night of 22 October 1707 Old Style, (2 November 1707 by the modern calendar), the squadron entered the mouth of the English Channel and Shovell's sailing masters believed they were on the last leg of their journey. The fleet was thought to be sailing safely west of Ushant, an island outpost off the coast of Brittany. However, because of a combination of the bad weather and the mariners' inability to accurately calculate their longitude, the fleet was off course and closing in on the Isles of Scilly instead.

In 1950, she married Tobin Armstrong and moved to Kenedy County, Texas. From 1966 to 1968, she was the vice chairman of the Texas Republican Party. From 1971 to 1973 she was Co-chairman of the Republican National Committee, and she was the keynote speaker at the 1972 Republican National Convention. (She was the first woman from either major party to keynote at a national convention). Nixon named her as Counselor to the President on 19 December 1972, which she held from January 19, 1973 to November 1974 under President Ford. During her tenure as Counselor, Armstrong founded the first Office of Women's Programs in the White House, predecessor to the current White House Council on Women and Girls. Fluent in Spanish, she was Nixon's liaison to Hispanic Americans and was a member of a Cabinet committee on opportunities for Spanish-speaking people. In 1973, a young Karl Rove, then on his way to becoming the chairman of the College Republicans, suggested in a memorandum to Armstrong that the Republican Party show nonpolitical films (such as John Wayne movies and Reefer Madness) at College Republican clubs as part of a strategy to raise support for the party among students and for fundraising.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

The team did not expect to produce metallic hydrogen, as it was not using solid hydrogen, thought to be necessary, and was working at temperatures above those specified by metallization theory. Previous studies in which solid hydrogen was compressed inside diamond anvils to pressures of up to , did not confirm detectable metallization. The team had sought simply to measure the less extreme electrical conductivity changes they expected. The researchers used a 1960s-era light-gas gun, originally employed in guided missile studies, to shoot an impactor plate into a sealed container containing a half-millimeter thick sample of liquid hydrogen. The liquid hydrogen was in contact with wires leading to a device measuring electrical resistance. The scientists found that, as pressure rose to , the electronic energy band gap, a measure of electrical resistance, fell to almost zero. The band-gap of hydrogen in its uncompressed state is about , making it an insulator but, as the pressure increases significantly, the band-gap gradually fell to . Because the thermal energy of the fluid (the temperature became about due to compression of the sample) was above , the hydrogen might be considered metallic.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

The work uses an English language libretto by Christopher Hassall to tell the tragic tale of a German woman who is forced to leave her country due to oppression from the Nazi regime, as the Nazis did not like her political views. The opera was commissioned by the British Broadcasting Corporation following the popular success of Reizenstein's 1951 cantata Voices of Night. The opera premiered on 25 July 1952 on BBC Third Programme with conductor Norman Del Mar leading the BBC Symphony Orchestra and singers Victoria Sladen (as Anna) and Lloyd Strauss-Smith (as Pavel). It was submitted by the BBC later that year for the Prix Italia. Critical reaction to the work was mixed. The New Statesman described the work as \"engaging\" and a \"worthwhile experiment\".

In World War II, the then-primarily Nisei battalion was composed largely of former members of the Hawaii Army National Guard. The 100th saw heavy combat during World War II, starting in September 1943 and continuing after being attached as a battalion of the 442nd Infantry Regiment, another mostly Nisei military unit, in June 1944. The unit was unofficially nicknamed the Purple Heart Battalion, with the motto \"Remember Pearl Harbor\" and \"Go for Broke\", which was later adopted by other Japanese-American units. Based at Fort Shafter, Honolulu, Hawaii, the 100th Battalion continues the legacy of the 442nd Infantry Regiment, officially designated as 100th Battalion/442nd Infantry Regiment. The 100th Battalion/442nd Infantry Regiment has maintained an alignment with the active 25th Infantry Division since a reorganization in 1972. This alignment has resulted in the 100th's mobilization for combat duty in the Vietnam War and the Iraq War. The 100th Infantry Battalion is staffed with reservists from Hawaii, American Samoa, Guam and Saipan.

It is in the community of Llangoed. The name comes from (which can mean \"head\", \"end\" or \"promontory\") and M\u00f4n, which is the Welsh word for Anglesey. It is the site of a historic monastery and associated 12th-century church. Walls near the well next to the church may be part of the oldest remaining Christian building in Wales. Penmon also has an award-winning beach and the Anglesey Coastal Path follows its shores. Quarries in Penmon have provided stone for many important buildings and structures, including Birmingham Town Hall and the two bridges that cross the Menai Strait.

On 29 May 1933, he was appointed deputy director of the Political Office of the W\u00fcrttemberg State Police. In 1934, he was appointed head of the Gestapo in the German state of W\u00fcrttemberg and soon assigned to the main office of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD). On 11 May 1937, he became head of the Gestapo in Breslau. After the incorporation of Austria in 1938, Stahlecker became SD chief of the Danube district (Vienna), a post he retained even after being promoted to SS-Standartenf\u00fchrer. In the summer of 1938, Stahlecker became Inspector of the Security Police in Austria, succeeding Gestapo chief Heinrich M\u00fcller in that position. As of 20 August 1938, Stahlecker was the formal head of the Central Agency for Jewish Emigration in Vienna, though its de facto leader was Adolf Eichmann. Differences of opinion with Reinhard Heydrich motivated Stahlecker to move to the Ausw\u00e4rtiges Amt (Foreign Office), after which he held posts as the commander of the Security Police and SD in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia under SS-Brigadef\u00fchrer Karl Hermann Frank. In mid-October 1939, Eichmann and Stahlecker decided to begin implementation of the Nisko Plan.\n Passage 2:After his graduation, he was elected as the chief judge of Ascoli, but he then settled in his native town, where he filled various responsible offices. Both father and son belonged to a confraternity suspected of meeting for the discussion of opinions hostile to the Roman church. The Inquisition was upon the track of the heretics, and Gentili, together with his father and one of his brothers, Scipione Gentili, were forced to leave Italy because of their Protestant beliefs. The three first went to Ljubljana (German: Laibach), now in Slovenia, the capital of the duchy of Carniola. From there, Alberico went on to the German university towns of T\u00fcbingen and Heidelberg. At their first halting place, Ljubljana, Matteo, doubtless through the influence of his brother-in-law, Nicolo Petrelli, a jurist high in favour with the court, was appointed chief physician for the duchy of Carniola. In the meantime, the papal authorities had excommunicated the fugitives and soon procured their expulsion from Austrian territory. Early in 1580, Alberico set out for England, preceded by a reputation that procured him offers of professorships at Heidelberg and at T\u00fcbingen, where Scipio was left to commence his university studies. Alberico reached London in August, with introductions to Giovanni Battista Castiglione, the Italian tutor to Queen Elizabeth I. Gentili soon became acquainted with Dr Tobia Matthew, the Archbishop of York. On 14 January 1581, Gentili was accordingly incorporated from Perugia as a D.C.L. giving Gentili the right of teaching law, which he first exercised in St John's College, Oxford. Subsequently, Gentili was appointed as the Regius professor of civil law at Oxford University by the Chancellor of Oxford University, Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester. He was commissioned to prepare a revised version of the statutory laws of his home town, a task which he completed in 1577. After a short stay in Wittenberg, Germany, he returned to Oxford.\n Passage 3:The game would be published by Sega in 1987 and released in Japanese arcades. It ran on a Sega System 2 board. It was based on a Z80 processor that runs at 4\u00a0MHz, with audio provided by two SN76489 (also known as SN76496) chips that run at 4\u00a0MHz each. It used raster standard graphics and monaural sound. Upon its release for the arcades in Japan in 1987, Wonder Boy: Monster Land had slow sales, but it would eventually pick up to become a decent seller. Before Sega published it on its own console, Hudson obtained the rights and program from Escape (Westone) and published it on the PC Engine under the altered name Bikkuriman World (to avoid the conflict of Sega's character 'Wonder Boy') in October 1987. Sega ported the game to its Master System console in 1988, where in Japan it was titled Super Wonder Boy: Monster World. It was also ported by Activision for the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, and ZX Spectrum in 1989. The Activision-published version bore the title of Super Wonder Boy in Monster Land on their packaging artwork.

Thomas Price's Independent Rifle Company, one of the original ten independent companies of riflemen from the frontier regions of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia authorized by the Continental Congress on June 14, 1775. He received his commission dated January 1, 1776, as a third lieutenant while serving at the Siege of Boston. In June 1776 Tannehill and his company were incorporated into the newly organized Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment, at which time he advanced to second lieutenant. Later that year a large portion of his regiment was captured or killed at the Battle of Fort Washington on northern Manhattan Island. However, those members of the unit not taken in the battle, including Tannehill, continued to serve actively with Washington's Main Army, participating in the Battles of Trenton and Princeton, and in the spring of 1777 were administratively attached to the 11th Virginia Regiment. Tannehill was promoted to first lieutenant on May 18, 1777, and the following month he was attached to the newly organized Provisional Rifle Corps commanded by Col. Daniel Morgan, which played a major role in the Battles of Saratoga and a peripheral role in the Battle of Monmouth. He returned to the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment (his permanent unit) in mid-1778 when Lt. Col. Moses Rawlings, the regiment's commander who had been exchanged from British captivity earlier that year, was marshaling the remnants of his unit and recruiting new members while stationed at Fort Frederick, Maryland. In early 1779 Tannehill and the regiment were assigned to Fort Pitt of present-day western Pennsylvania where they supplemented other Continental forces engaged in the defense of frontier settlements from Indian raids. Tannehill advanced to the rank of captain on July 29, 1779, and he commanded the regiment in late 1780. He was discharged from service on January 1, 1781, when his unit was disbanded.\n Passage 2:Friends dissolved shortly afterwards, and Kipner formed a new group, Skyband. Lloyd and Cotton left MGM when Curb also left to establish his own production company. The pair recruited Texan-born Chris Christian, and in 1975 the trio recorded their first album, Cotton, Lloyd & Christian, issued by 20th Century Records. Their version of the Del Shannon song \"I Go to Pieces\" - a 1965 hit for Peter and Gordon - became a #66 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. Other tracks included a slowed-down version of the Supremes' hit \"Baby Love\"; a medley of songs from the Who's Tommy; and \"I Don't Know Why You Love Me\". The album was repackaged by Curb and Lloyd in 1976, and used as the music soundtrack of a movie, The Pom Pom Girls. The trio's second album, Number Two, also appeared in 1976, and in April 1977 they released another single, \"Crying in the Rain\", written by Carole King and Howie Greenfield and first recorded by the Everly Brothers. Both albums were produced by Lloyd and Curb. No further recordings by the trio were released.\n Passage 3:Arieli was born in Ashkelon in 1959, the seventh and youngest son of parents from Iran.

While at university he joined the Labor Party. On 22 August 1964 he married Jennifer Claire Dodd, with whom he had two sons. He worked as a lecturer at Ballarat College of Advanced Education, contesting the federal seat of Ballarat for the Labor Party in 1972, 1974 and 1975. In 1978 he won the state Legislative Council seat of Ballarat Province at a by-election, only to lose it in 1979.

After he was named most valuable player of the Hula Bowl, he was drafted by the Cleveland Browns as the first overall selection in the 1954 NFL Draft. The Browns had needed someone to take over for the veteran Otto Graham, but they soon discovered that Garrett had a liability as a quarterback: he stuttered, which made calling plays difficult.\n Passage 3:There is evidence that the Second Bulgarian Empire ruled at least nominally the Wallachian lands up to the Ruc\u0103r\u2013Bran corridor as late as the late 14th century. In a charter by Radu I, the Wallachian voivode requests that tsar Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria order his customs officers at Ruc\u0103r and the D\u00e2mbovi\u0163a River bridge to collect tax following the law. The presence of Bulgarian customs officers at the Carpathians indicates a Bulgarian suzerainty over those lands, though Radu's imperative tone hints at a strong and increasing Wallachian autonomy. Under Radu I and his successor Dan I, the realms in Transylvania and Severin continued to be disputed with Hungary. Basarab was succeeded by Nicholas Alexander, followed by Vladislav I. Vladislav attacked Transylvania after Louis I occupied lands south of the Danube, conceded to recognize him as overlord in 1368, but rebelled again in the same year; his rule also witnessed the first confrontation between Wallachia and the Ottoman Empire (a battle in which Vladislav was allied with Ivan Shishman). After the Magyar conquest (10-11th century), Transylvania had become an autonomous and multi-ethnic voivodeship led by a voivode appointed by the King of Hungary until the 16th century. Several Kings of Hungary invited settlers from Central and Western Europe, such as the Saxons, to come to Transylvania and occupy the region. The Szeklers were brought to southeastern Transylvania as border guards. Romanians are mentioned by the Hungarian documents (township called Olahteluk) in the 13th century (1283) in Bihar County. The \"land of Romanians\" (Terram Blacorum) appeared in Fogaras, and this area was mentioned under the name \"Olachi\" in 1285.

Passage 1:The mediaeval historical development that Homberg experienced closely matches that experienced by neighbouring villages such as Kirrweiler, Deimberg, Buborn, Langweiler and Hausweiler. Like these places, Homberg belonged until 1140 to the Nahegau, and then thereafter until 1263 to the Waldgraviate, which itself had arisen from the Nahegau. As far as is now known, Homberg had its first documentary mention in 1319. In the document in question, an arbitrator confirmed that Waldgrave Friedrich of Kyrburg had to forgo all his claims to rights to Hoenberg and a series of other places in the \u201cGericht auf der H\u00f6he\u201d (\u201cCourt on the Heights\u201d). The Gericht auf der H\u00f6he was said to be a constituent district of the \u201cHochgericht auf der Heide\u201d (\u201cHigh Court on the Heath\u201d), which comprised, roughly, lands in a triangle bounded by the Nahe, the Glan and the Steinalp (another river). The 1319 document dealt with a dispute between the two Waldgravial sidelines of Kyrburg and Dhaun-Grumbach. About 1344, in his own documents, the name \u201cFriedrich von Hoenberg\u201d appeared. He was obviously a nobleman who came from Homberg, but nothing else about him has come to light. The villages under the Gericht auf der H\u00f6he, among which was Homberg, were pledged first, in 1363, by Johann von Dhaun to Sponheim-Starkenburg and then in 1443 by Waldgrave and Rhinegrave Friedrich to the last of the Counts of Veldenz, namely Friedrich III, whose daughter Anna married King Ruprecht's son Count Palatine Stephan. The document whereby this arrangement was laid out referred to the village's inhabitants as the \u201cpoor people of Grumbach\u201d. By uniting his own Palatine holdings with the now otherwise heirless County of Veldenz \u2013 his wife had inherited the county upon her father Friedrich III's death in 1444, but not his comital title \u2013 and by redeeming the hitherto pledged County of Zweibr\u00fccken, Stephan founded a new County Palatine, as whose comital residence he chose the town of Zweibr\u00fccken: the County Palatine \u2013 later Duchy \u2013 of Palatinate-Zweibr\u00fccken. Thus, Homberg, and the other villages, too, lay within this duchy, but they were all returned to the Waldgraviate in 1477 when the pledge was redeemed.\n Passage 2:Hoping to rebound from their divisional home loss to the Patriots, the Jets flew to Qualcomm Stadium for a Week 3 MNF duel with the San Diego Chargers. In the first quarter, New York took flight as CB David Barrett returned an interception 25 yards for a touchdown. The Chargers responded with kicker Nate Kaeding getting a 36-yard field goal, along with QB Philip Rivers completing a 1-yard TD pass to FB Mike Tolbert. In the second quarter, San Diego increased its lead with CB Antonio Cromartie returning an interception 52 yards for a touchdown. The Jets answered with QB Brett Favre completing a 3-yard TD pass to WR Laveranues Coles. The turning point in the game occurred on the following kickoff, an on-side kick, which traveled only 15 yards before the Chargers picked up the ball. They then added a touchdown, with Rivers completing a 27-yard TD pass to WR Chris Chambers. Following another interception, the Chargers scored again with a 6-yard TD pass to TE Antonio Gates.\n Passage 3:Lea Hall is a former country house standing to the northwest of the village of Wimboldsley, Cheshire, England. It dates from the early part of the 18th\u00a0century, and was built for the Lowndes family. During the 19th\u00a0century the house was owned by Joseph Verdin. Additions, including dormer windows, were made in the 19th\u00a0century. During the 20th\u00a0century the house was divided into three flats. The house is constructed in red brick with ashlar dressings and a tiled roof. It is in two storeys, with an attic and a basement. The roof is large and hipped, with a viewing platform. The entrance front is symmetrical, in five bays, the central bay protruding slightly forward. This bay contains a doorway with a swan's nest pediment decorated with scrolls, and containing a crest with the initials J V (for Joseph Verdin).

Bumgarner had an excellent regular season for the Giants, finishing with a career-low in ERA and a career-high in strikeouts, finishing fourth in the National League in both categories. On the hill for the New York Mets was Noah Syndergaard, who himself finished 3rd in the NL in ERA and 9th in strikeouts. The pitching matchup didn't disappoint, it took until the bottom of the third inning for the game's first hit and baserunner, with Syndergaard striking out four straight batters on two occasions. The closest either side came to scoring was in the top of the 6th when, after Denard Span singled and stole second base with two outs, Brandon Belt hit a long fly ball to center field which was caught on the dead run by Curtis Granderson, smashing into the wall and holding on. Syndergaard exited after 7 innings, having struck out 10. Crucially as it turned out, the Giants had forced Syndergaard out of the game with Bumgarner still going strong. Another golden opportunity was squandered by the Giants in the top of the 8th inning, when Addison Reed struck out Hunter Pence to end the inning with the bases loaded. After Bumgarner left a runner in scoring position in the bottom of the 8th, the game moved to the 9th with the Mets bringing in closer Jeurys Familia. Brandon Crawford led the inning off with a double to left-center, but \u00c1ngel Pag\u00e1n couldn't lay down the sacrifice bunt and then struck out. Joe Panik worked a walk and Conor Gillaspie stepped up to the plate to launch a three-run home run to right field. Gillaspie had only started the game because Eduardo N\u00fa\u00f1ez was still dealing with a hamstring injury and had to be left off the roster. Bumgarner then got the final three outs, completing the shutout just as he had done in the 2014 Wild Card Game. Bumgarner made 119 pitches, allowed just 6 total baserunners, striking out 6 and setting an MLB record of 23 consecutive scoreless innings pitched in postseason elimination games. With the win, the Giants equalled the Major League record for consecutive postseason series wins with 11, also extending their streak of postseason elimination game wins to 9.\n Passage 3:Walia began her career with television commercials.

The new Tyrrell 001-Cosworth, appeared in August and suffered problems but showed promise. Tyrrell continued to be sponsored by French fuel company Elf, and Stewart raced in a car painted French Racing Blue for many years.

Following the Divide in a clockwise direction, it leads east and southeast through western Kentucky through the Land Between the Lakes, a narrow area between the Tennessee River and Cumberland River, then passes into Tennessee, where it continues southeast, passing south of the Nashville Basin on top of Duck River Ridge. Turning more to the east, the Divide climbs onto the low plateau of The Barrens, and then onto the higher Cumberland Plateau. The Divide turns northeast along the crest of the Cumberland Plateau, then follows the ridgecrest of Cumberland Mountain northeast to Cumberland Gap, at the junction of Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia. The Divide continues northeast along the Kentucky-Virginia border, first following Cumberland Mountain, then Little Black and Black Mountain, after which it turns east into Virginia.

After five years' absence, he was revived in several Marvel titles: Marvel Two-In-One #4-5 (July-Sept. 1974), Giant Size Defenders #5, and Defenders #26-29 (July-Nov. 1975). In each case, other heroes such as Captain America, the Thing, and the Defenders aid Astro and the Guardians against the alien Badoon. The first story established that if Vance Astro's containment suit were breached, he would age 1,000 years in a second.

Unlike Goyu-shuku and Akasaka-juku, but this did not cause a huge economic decline to Okazaki-shuku. There was a horse-drawn rail line connecting Okazaki to the train station, as well as a teachers' school, which kept the town alive. On the other hand, Okazaki was not able to compete with the growth of Toyohashi, which was located directly on the railway, and which gained city-status first.

In 1881 the B&A hired Henry Hobson Richardson to design several stations for the railroad. Richardson died unexpectedly in 1886 and the remaining station design work was transferred to the Boston-based architecture firm of Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge. They designed the Chatham Station which was opened for service along the B&A's Boston to Albany line in 1887. The Richardsonian Romanesque building features a Dutch gable roof with wide eaves and colonnade porticos that extend out east and west along the tracks over the low platform. The walls are made of lightly colored rusticated stone with window and door frames, sills, and lintels of contrasting brownstone. A prominent bow window faces trackside and once was used as part of the stationmaster's office.\n Passage 3:Several team changes took place before the season began.

Rome became the center of the Catholic Church and the capital city of the Papal States; consequently, a great number of churches, convents and other religious buildings were erected in the city, sometimes above the ruins of older pre-Christian sites of worship. Churches proliferated during the Renaissance, when the Rome's most notable churches were built (this includes St. Peter's basilica on the Vatican Hill (the largest church in the world) and the city cathedral of St. John at the Lateran. The Papacy established its residence first in the Lateran Palace, then in the Quirinal Palace. When Rome was annexed by force to the newly unified Kingdom of Italy In 1870, Pope Pius IX retired to the Vatican, proclaiming himself a prisoner of the Savoy monarchy and leading to decades of conflict between the neonate state and the Catholic Church. This was resolved in 1929, when the Lateran Treaty were signed in Rome, establishing the right for the Holy See to govern the Vatican City as an independent, sovereign state.

Passage 1:The first production of tinplate was probably in Bohemia, from where the trade spread to Saxony, and was well-established there by the 1660s. Andrew Yarranton and Ambrose Crowley (a Stourbridge blacksmith and father of the more famous Sir Ambrose) visited Dresden in 1667 and found out how it was made. In doing so, they were sponsored by various local ironmasters and people connected with the project to make the river Stour navigable. In Saxony, the plates were forged, but when they conducted experiments on their return to England, they tried rolling the iron. This led to the ironmasters Philip Foley and Joshua Newborough (two of the sponsors) in 1670 erecting a new mill, Wolverley Lower Mill (or forge). This contained three shops, one being a slitting mill (which would serve as a rolling mill), and the others were forges. In 1678 one of these was making frying pans and the other drawing out blooms made in finery forges elsewhere. It is likely that the intention was to roll the plates and then finish them under a hammer, but the plan was frustrated by one William Chamberlaine renewing a patent granted to him and Dud Dudley in 1662.\n Passage 2:Suffolk County had long been a Republican bastion in New York State. U.S. Congressman Rick Lazio, who opposed Hillary Clinton in the 2000 Senate race, was from Suffolk County. However, recent elections have turned the county more toward the Democrats. In 2003, Democrat Steve Levy was elected county executive, ending longtime Republican control. In 2001, Democrat Thomas Spota was elected District Attorney, and ran unopposed in 2005. Although Suffolk voters gave George H. W. Bush a victory here in 1992, the county voted for Bill Clinton in 1996 and continued the trend by giving Al Gore an 11-percent victory in the county in 2000. 2004 Democratic candidate John Kerry won by a much smaller margin of one percent, in 2008 Democratic candidate Barack Obama won by a slightly larger 4.4 percent margin, 52%-47%. In 2016, Republican candidate Donald Trump won Suffolk County by a 6.9 percent margin after absentees, marking the largest margin of victory for the Republicans since 1988. It was the only large county (over 200,000 voters) in New York State that Donald Trump won.\n Passage 3:Greek letter organizations (GLOs) first appeared at the university in 1847 when two men visiting from Yale University installed a chapter of Delta Kappa Epsilon.

Unlike other remains assigned to the family Thylacosmilidae (a group of metatherian predators equipped with \"saber teeth\") that had been found previously, Anachlysictis is the first record of such borhyaenoids in northern South America, and also most primitive and ancient in the family (in fact, is the first confirmed record that did not belong to the genus Thylacosmilus, until the official publication of Patagosmilus in 2010). This species was found in the Villavieja Formation in the area of La Venta in Colombia, a famous fossil deposit in the Middle Miocene (Laventan; 13.8-11.8 million years ago), based on fragments that include a front portion of the lower jaw, with an incipient molar tooth and a piece of carnassial from the front of the maxilla.\n Passage 2:In 2002, the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) announced that it would acknowledge the site of Victoria Rink with \"a commemorative plaque or other historical site marker to remind the passers-by of the existence of the Victoria Skating Rink, the birthplace of organized hockey.\" The commemoration has been marked in two ways.

Although Tim Day had wanted to write a direct sequel to  featuring a final conflict between Pinhead and Kirsty, Bob Weinstein directed him to rewrite Deader into a Hellraiser sequel similar in tone to the Japanese horror films Ring, and Pulse. After a brief delay during the production of the 2006 American remake of Pulse, work on Deader resumed. Scott Derrickson was approached to direct but declined, and Rick Bota was rehired from the previous film. The film was originally rewritten to take place in London and later the Lower East Side of Manhattan before the producers opted to film it simultaneously with another Hellraiser sequel, titled  in Romania, between October and December of 2002, to save costs.

The stained glass-inspired image shows Jesus sitting on a throne adorned with gang-related symbols. In the artwork, Jesus is holding a gold \"Jesus Piece\" chain and pointing to a symbol on his breast plate. The red bandana over his mouth is a reference to the Cedar Block Piru Bloods gang, to which Game is allegedly a member. The artwork has a slightly altered logo on the top, which features on all of Game's previous studio albums. The album's title Jesus Piece is stylized as Je5us Piece, depicting that it is Game's fifth studio album. Je5us Piece logo is styled after the iconic Louis Vuitton.

In the Bronze Age, several states flourished in the area of Greater Armenia, including the Hittite Empire (at the height of its power), Mitanni (South-Western historical Armenia), and Hayasa-Azzi (1600\u20131200 BC). Soon after the Hayasa-Azzi were the Nairi (1400\u20131000 BC) and the Kingdom of Urartu (1000\u2013600 BC), who successively established their sovereignty over the Armenian Highland. Each of the aforementioned nations and tribes participated in the ethnogenesis of the Armenian people. Yerevan, the modern capital of Armenia, dates back to the 8th century BC, with the founding of the fortress of Erebuni in 782 BC by King Argishti I at the western extreme of the Ararat plain. Erebuni has been described as \"designed as a great administrative and religious centre, a fully royal capital.\"\n Passage 2:In medieval times the part of Gillingham known as Grange was a limb of the Cinque Ports and the maritime importance of the area continued until the late 1940s. Indeed, a large part of Chatham Dockyard lay within Gillingham: the dockyard started in Gillingham and, until the day it was closed in 1984, two-thirds of the then modern-day dockyard lay within the boundaries of Gillingham. The dockyard was founded by Queen Elizabeth I on the site of the present gun wharf, the establishment being transferred to the present site about 1622. In 1667 a Dutch fleet sailed up the River Medway and, having landed at Queenborough on the Isle of Sheppey and laying siege to the fort at Sheerness, invaded Gillingham in what became known as the raid on the Medway. The Dutch eventually retreated, but the incident caused great humiliation to the Royal Navy.\n Passage 3:In 1964 he moved to Santa Monica, California, and formed Rising Sons with fellow blues rock musician Ry Cooder and Jessie Lee Kincaid, landing a record deal with Columbia Records soon after. The group was one of the first interracial bands of the period, which likely made them commercially unviable. An album was never released (though a single was) and the band soon broke up, though Legacy Records did release The Rising Sons Featuring Taj Mahal and Ry Cooder in 1992 with material from that period. During this time Mahal was working with others, musicians like Howlin' Wolf, Buddy Guy, Lightnin' Hopkins, and Muddy Waters. Mahal stayed with Columbia after the Rising Sons to begin his solo career, releasing the self-titled Taj Mahal in 1968, The Natch'l Blues in 1969, and Giant Step/De Old Folks at Home with Kiowa session musician Jesse Ed Davis from Oklahoma, who played guitar and piano (also in 1969). During this time he and Cooder worked with the Rolling Stones, with whom he has performed at various times throughout his career. In 1968, he performed in the film The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus. He recorded a total of twelve albums for Columbia from the late 1960s into the 1970s. His work of the 1970s was especially important, in that his releases began incorporating West Indian and Caribbean music, jazz and reggae into the mix. In 1972, he acted in and wrote the film score for the movie Sounder, which starred Cicely Tyson. He reprised his role and returned as composer in the sequel, Part 2, Sounder.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:The Victor Emmanuel Railway, which included both the Culoz\u2013Modane railway across Savoy and the Turin\u2013Modane railway across Piedmont, was largely built in the 1850s by the Kingdom of Sardinia and named after its king, Victor Emmanuel II. Until 1860 Sardinia included both Savoy and Piedmont. The line from Turin to Susa was inaugurated on 22 May 1854. Work on the tunnel began on 31 August 1857 and was completed in September 1871. Work had begun on the line between Bussoleno and Bardonecchia in 1867 and was completed at the same time as the tunnel. The tunnel and line were opened on 16 October 1871. By that time, the Savoy side of the tunnel had become part of France. The decision of the engineers to begin the line at Bussoleno in order to reduce the gradient on the climb near Meana was much criticized for bypassing the city of Susa, which was left isolated on a short branch line. The opening of the tunnel also led to the closure of the short-lived Mont Cenis Pass Railway. In 1865 the line became part of the network of the Societ\u00e0 per le strade ferrate dell'Alta Italia (Upper Italian Railways, SFAI) on its foundation in 1865 and was taken over by the Rete Mediterranea (Mediterranean Network) in 1885. Finally in 1905 it became part of the Ferrovie dello Stato network.\n Passage 2:\"Learn the Hard Way\" is the album's fourth track. It is the third song on the album, and shares similarities with the song \"Never Say Never\". The Guy Roche-produced \"Almost Doesn't Count\" is the fifth track. Brandy performed the song in the 1999 film Double Platinum, starring Diana Ross and herself. The international single \"Top of the World\" is the album's sixth track. It is a collaboration with Mase and the song talks about Brandy as a popstar just trying to be her and not feeling like being in her own world. In the music video, directed by Paul Hunter, Brandy was featured incurring various supernatural phenomena. She spontaneously floated in the air, flipping and somersaulting above random objects; telephone poles and vehicles, as people stopped to stare. These strange phenomena also included balancing herself vertically and horizontally alongside skyscrapers and buildings. The Darkchild-produced \"U Don't Know Me (Like U Used To)\", which is the album's seventh and final single, is noted for its remix version with Shaunta and Da Brat. The remix was released as the lead single to the same-named EP. \"Never Say Never\", also produced by Rodney Jerkins, is the eighth song of the album. \"Never Say Never\" was released as a Germany single in 2000. \"Truthfully\", a ballad about a broken relationship, was penned by former Boyz II Men member, singer-songwriter Marc Nelson. Recorded in a single take, it took Nelson five different sessions to get Norwood in the recording studio as she felt initially nervous about working with him. Main production on the song was helmed by Harvey Mason, Jr. who received his first major placement as a producer on \"Truthfully\". Mason was consulted by Jerkins after he had shopped around several tracks for record executives.\n Passage 3:Fraser was born on 10 May 1947 in Surbiton, Surrey, the second son of Harry MacKenzie Fraser, a London solicitor, and Ada Alice Gittins of Pontypool in the county of Monmouthshire. His brother was Malcolm Fraser (1939\u20132012), Emeritus Professor of Opera at the University of Cincinnati and co-founder of the Buxton Festival. At the age of eight, Robert Fraser won a choral scholarship to Winchester Cathedral, where he sang the daily services while studying at the Pilgrims School in the Close. Among his fellow choristers were the future newscaster Jon Snow and international tenor Julian Pike. After attending Kingston Grammar School Fraser went on to the University of Sussex to read English with David Daiches and Anthony Nuttall. He later wrote a doctorate on tradition in English poetry at Royal Holloway, University of London where the college's famous gallery of Victorian paintings was to inspire his illustrated volume of poetry The Founders\u2019 Gift: Impressions from a Collection (2017).

Despite this treachery, he was kept in imperial service, where good generals were needed, and was sent into Asia Minor again with a force of 3,000 Franco-Norman heavy cavalry. There Roussel conquered some territory in Galatia and declared it an independent state in 1073, with himself as prince, following the example set by his fellow Normans in the Mezzogiorno. His capital was Ankara, now the capital of Turkey. He defeated the Caesar John Ducas and sacked Chrysopolis, near Constantinople. He even supported a usurper candidate, but by formally ceding lands that the Seljuk Turks had actually conquered, the emperor Michael VII persuaded the Seljuk warlord Tutush I to remove Roussel. However both Ducas and Roussel were defeated and captured by Turkish forces, fortunately for Roussel his wife was able to pay the ransom demanded by the Turks allowing Roussel to return to Amasea, where the population so loved him that he made himself undisputed governor. He was given up by the people through a ploy of Alexius Comnenus (1074), then a general, later an emperor. \n Passage 3:The regiment was raised by the Honourable East India Company as the Madras Europeans from independent companies in 1742 \u2013 \"European\" indicating it was composed of white soldiers, not Indian sepoys.

When German dictator Adolf Hitler received word that Hungary's Regent, Admiral Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, was secretly negotiating his country's surrender to the advancing Red Army, he sent commando leader Otto Skorzeny of the Waffen-SS and former special forces commander Adrian von F\u00f6lkersam to Hungary. Hitler feared that Hungary's surrender would expose his southern flank, where the Kingdom of Romania had just joined with the Soviets and cut off a million German troops still fighting the Soviet advance in the Balkan peninsula. The operation was preceded by Operation Margarethe in March 1944, which was the occupation of Hungary by German forces, which Hitler had hoped would secure Hungary's place in the Axis powers.\n Passage 3:Paul Roessler was born on August 27, 1958, in New Haven, Connecticut.

Passage 1:Blinky is a three-eyed orange fish featured primarily in \"Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish\". Likely mutated by toxic waste from the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant pouring into the river, Blinky became a major news story when he was caught by Bart Simpson. Mr. Burns defends the fish, arguing that his extra eye is merely the next step in evolution. Mr. Burns goes to the Simpsons' house for a meal to boost his race for governor. Marge, a supporter of Burns' opponent Mary Bailey, deliberately serves Blinky for dinner. Mr. Burns spits the fish out and subsequently loses the election. Blinky was briefly seen again in episodes \"Homer's Odyssey\" and \"Raging Abe Simpson and His Grumbling Grandson in 'The Curse of the Flying Hellfish'\". Blinky also made a brief appearance in an underwater section of the tube-way Fry travels through in the pilot episode of the animated series Futurama, which was created by The Simpsons creator Matt Groening. Blinky also appears in an episode of Futuramas seventh season titled \"\"; Blinky is seen in a fish bowl on Jrrr's desk.\n Passage 2:The first production of tinplate was probably in Bohemia, from where the trade spread to Saxony, and was well-established there by the 1660s. Andrew Yarranton and Ambrose Crowley (a Stourbridge blacksmith and father of the more famous Sir Ambrose) visited Dresden in 1667 and found out how it was made. In doing so, they were sponsored by various local ironmasters and people connected with the project to make the river Stour navigable. In Saxony, the plates were forged, but when they conducted experiments on their return to England, they tried rolling the iron. This led to the ironmasters Philip Foley and Joshua Newborough (two of the sponsors) in 1670 erecting a new mill, Wolverley Lower Mill (or forge). This contained three shops, one being a slitting mill (which would serve as a rolling mill), and the others were forges. In 1678 one of these was making frying pans and the other drawing out blooms made in finery forges elsewhere. It is likely that the intention was to roll the plates and then finish them under a hammer, but the plan was frustrated by one William Chamberlaine renewing a patent granted to him and Dud Dudley in 1662.\n Passage 3:For the better part of a century, Missouri has been reckoned as the nation's bellwether state. Prior to 2008, since 1904, Missouri had voted for the winner in every presidential election except in 1956 when the state narrowly voted for Democrat Adlai Stevenson of neighboring Illinois over incumbent Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower. In recent years, however, it has gradually been trending Republican. Although Bill Clinton of neighboring Arkansas won the state with ease during both of his elections in 1992 and 1996, Al Gore and John Kerry considered the Show-Me State a lost cause and did not campaign much there. Although Barack Obama is from neighboring Illinois, at first he likewise put the state as a secondary concern in relation to other swing states such as Ohio and Virginia where he thought he had more of a chance. As his lead diminished in the summer months, he and McCain moved the campaign to more Democratic-friendly states, as McCain maintained a comfortable polling lead in Missouri. Similar hypothetical general match-up polls taken between McCain and Hillary Rodham Clinton, however, showed Clinton always leading in Missouri.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:The early modern period in Britain saw religious conflict resulting from the Reformation and the recusancy that emerged in opposition to it. The Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was a failed attempt by a group of English Catholics to assassinate the Protestant King James I, and to blow up the Palace of Westminster, the English seat of government. Although the modern concept of religious terrorism, or indeed terrorism at all, had not yet come into use in the seventeenth century, David C. Rapoport and Lindsay Clutterbuck point out that the Plot, with its use of explosives, was an early precursor of nineteenth century anarchist terrorism. Sue Mahan and Pamala L. Griset classify the plot as an act of religious terrorism, writing that \"Fawkes and his colleagues justified their actions in terms of religion.\" Peter Steinfels also characterizes this plot as a notable case of religious terrorism.\n Passage 2:Australian singer and actress Jessica Mauboy has released one video album and appeared in thirty music videos, two films, and many television programs and commercials. After she became the runner-up on the fourth season of Australian Idol in 2006, Mauboy signed a recording contract with Sony Music Australia. In 2008, she released her debut studio album Been Waiting and six music videos for its singles were shot. Mauboy's first music video was for the album's lead single \"Running Back\" featuring American rapper Flo Rida. It was directed by Fin Edquist and portrayed a fictional relationship between Mauboy and Flo Rida. At the 2009 MTV Australia Awards, the video was nominated for Best Collaboration. Keir McFarlane directed the music videos for the following singles, \"Burn\" and the title track \"Been Waiting\".

It is extant in two divergent recensions, one in Samaritan Hebrew and the other in Arabic. The editio princeps is a published an Arabic manuscript written in the Samaritan alphabet, with a Latin translation and a long preface by T. W. Juynboll (Leyden, 1848). The Samaritan Hebrew version was published in 1908 by Moses Gaster. Though based on the Hebrew canonical Book of Joshua, it differs greatly from the latter in both form and content and the Samaritans ascribe no canonical authority to it. The author, who was of a much later period, amplified the Biblical narratives by weaving into them legends of a later date and developing the narratives themselves, at the same time altering certain statements in accordance with Samaritan views on history. Alterations that emphasize the Samaritan belief in the sanctity of Mount Gerizim, the site of the Samaritan temple, appear throughout the text; for example, an expanded passage calls Gerizim \"the chosen place\" and a description of the temple being built there follows the conclusion of the conquest of Canaan. It is divided into fifty chapters, and contains, after the account of Joshua, a brief description of the period following Joshua, agreeing to that extent with the Book of Judges. Then follow histories of Nebuchadnezzar, Alexander the Great, and the revolt against Hadrian; it ends with an incomplete account of Baba Rabba.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

William Lee (1739\u201395) and Dr. Arthur Lee (1740\u201392) were diplomats to England during the turbulent struggle for American independence. Hannah Lee was an early proponent of women's rights, and Alice Lee married the prominent physician William Shippen Jr. (1736-1808) of Philadelphia.\n Passage 2:In Bukovina, the Romanian nationalist Ion Nistor and his Democratic Union Party seized the opportunity and ran pro-Romanian Ukrainians and Poles as candidates for the 1919 elections. Active on the left side of the spectrum, Constantin Krakalia joined the Socialist Party. In early 1920, he spent time in prison for protesting against the People's Party (PP) government's clampdown on Ukrainian socialism. He ran in the elections of May against Bogatyrets, taking a seat in the Assembly of Deputies, where he demanded a plebiscite over the territorial status of Bukovina and Maramure\u0219. The election of November 1922 were held under the watch of National Liberal Party (PNL), which supported centralizing policies.

The kingdom reached its height under \u00c1ed\u00e1n mac Gabr\u00e1in (). During his reign D\u00e1l Riata's power and influence grew; it carried out naval expeditions to Orkney and the Isle of Man, and assaults on the Brittonic kingdom of Strathclyde and Anglian kingdom of Bernicia. However, King \u00c6thelfrith of Bernicia checked its growth at the Battle of Degsastan in 603. Serious defeats in Ireland and Scotland during the reign of Domnall Brecc (died 642) ended D\u00e1l Riata's \"golden age\", and the kingdom became a client of Northumbria for a time. In the 730s the Pictish king \u00d3engus I led campaigns against D\u00e1l Riata and brought it under Pictish overlordship by 741. There is disagreement over the fate of the kingdom from the late 8th century onwards. Some scholars have seen no revival of D\u00e1l Riatan power after the long period of foreign domination ( to ), while others have seen a revival under \u00c1ed Find (736\u2013778). Some even claim that the D\u00e1l Riata usurped the kingship of Fortriu. From 795 onward there were sporadic Viking raids in D\u00e1l Riata. In the following century, there may have been a merger of the D\u00e1l Riatan and Pictish crowns. Some sources say Cin\u00e1ed mac Ailp\u00edn (Kenneth MacAlpin) was king of D\u00e1l Riata before becoming king of the Picts in 843, following a disastrous defeat of the Picts by Vikings.

This response leads to chronic inflammation and Encapsulation of the dead worms in collagen fibers, and eventually to septal fibrosis (abnormal connective tissue growth) and cirrhosis of the liver. This leaves the eggs behind and they can become encased by Granulomatous tissue, with large sections of the Parenchyma becoming replaced by these egg masses. Capillaria hepatica can also cause Hepatomegaly.

Having studied at Westminster Hospital Medical School, he qualified MRCS, LRCP in 1954. He graduated Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MB BCh) from the University of Cambridge in 1955. He undertook his two pre-registration house officer placements at Westminster Hospital as a casualty officer and at Kingston Hospital as a house surgeon and obstetrics house officer.\n Passage 3:When the war ended, he returned to the Keystone Agency and travelled all over Europe as a freelance reporter. It was during one of these trips that he came up with the idea for his first thriller, The Night of Wenceslas (1960). The novel is set in Czechoslovakia during the Cold War, and tells the story of young Nicolas Whistler, a 24-year-old Londoner whose business trip to Prague goes horribly awry. The Night of Wenceslas was an instant success, inviting favourable comparisons with such luminaries as Eric Ambler. Davidson became one of the handful of living writers to have their first novel appear in a green Penguin jacket. The book won the Crime Writers' Association's Gold Dagger Award (the top prize for crime and spy fiction in Britain) as well as the Authors' Club First Novel Award. It was filmed as Hot Enough for June (1964), with Dirk Bogarde in the role of Whistler.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:Born in Hoheneggelsen (today part of S\u00f6hlde; then in the Kingdom of Prussia), Otto Ohlendorf came into the world as part of \"a farming family\". He joined the Nazi Party in 1925 (member 6631) and the SS (member #880) in 1926. Ohlendorf studied economics and law at the University of Leipzig and the University of G\u00f6ttingen, and by 1930 was already giving lectures at several economic institutions. He studied at the University of Pavia, where he gained his doctor's degree in jurisprudence; and by 1933 he obtained the position of a research directorship in the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. Ohlendorf was active in the National Socialist Students' League in both Kiel and G\u00f6ttingen and taught at the Nazi Party's school in Berlin. He participated in major debates between the SS, the German Labour Front, and the Quadrenniel Organization on economic policy. By 1938 he was also manager in the Trade section of the Reich Business Board (). Historian quips that for Ohlendorf, Nazism was a \"quest for race\" in the historical continuum, and even though he never stated it that way, his faith in Germandom was akin to that of his fellow SS intellectuals.\n Passage 2:In 1946, Anna Mae Hutchison posted a 26-14 record with 102 strikeouts in 51 games, setting an all-time, single-season record for games pitched, and also hurled the first nine-inning no-hitter in Belles history, a 1\u20130 victory over the Kenosha Comets. Winter finished with a 33-9 record, including 17 shutouts and 183 strikeouts in 46 pitching appearances. The Belles claimed first place with a league-best 74-38 record, and won the semifinal round of playoffs by defeating the South Bend Blue Sox in four games. In Game 1, English drove in the winning run by hitting a double in the bottom half of the 14th inning. Then, in decisive Game 5 she knocked the winning run with a single in the bottom half of the 17th inning. In this first round series she went 11-for-31 for a .353 average, including her two game-winning RBI. After that, the Belles beat the 1945 champions, the Rockford Peaches, four games to two in the final best-of-seven series to clinch the Championship Title. Throughout the playoffs, Kurys led all players in average, stolen bases and runs. On the other hand, Winter collected four wins in the playoffs, including a 14-inning, 1\u20130 shutout victory over the Peaches in decisive Game Six. The winning run was scored by Kurys on an RBI-single by Betty Trezza, while Danhauser handled 22 chances flawlessly. During the regular season, the Belles again showed a great defense, notably by infielders Danhauser (1B), Kurys (2B) and English (3B), while Perlick (LF), Schillace (CF) and Dapkus (RF) patrolled the outfield. And moreover, fielding ability and speed on the bases were immensely more crucial and challenging in a dominant pitching league.\n Passage 3:CCGS Labrador was a icebreaker. First commissioned on 8 July 1954 as Her Majesty's Canadian Ship (HMCS) Labrador (pennant number AW 50) in the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN), Captain O.C.S. \"Long Robbie\" Robertson, GM, RCN, in command. She was transferred to the Department of Transport (DOT) on 22 November 1957, and re-designated Canadian Government Ship (CGS) Labrador. She was among the DOT fleet assigned to the nascent Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) when that organization was formed in 1962, and further re-designated Canadian Coast Guard Ship (CCGS) Labrador. Her career marked the beginning of the CCG's icebreaker operations which continue to this day. She extensively charted and documented the then-poorly-known Canadian Arctic, and as HMCS Labrador was the first ship to circumnavigate North America in a single voyage. The ship was taken out of service in 1987 and broken up for scrap in 1989.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:From 1832 James Busby was assigned the post of official British resident in New Zealand. He played a role in drafting the Treaty of Waitangi, which established British colonial rule over New Zealand. Captain William Hobson was first appointed Lieutenant-Governor of New Zealand by letters patent on 24 November 1840 (having previously been the British Consul to New Zealand), when New Zealand was part of the colony of New South Wales. While Hobson is usually considered the first Governor of New Zealand, Sir George Gipps was the first governor over New Zealand, albeit only in his capacity as Governor of New South Wales, until New Zealand was established as a separate colony on 3 May 1841. Hobson continued in office until his death on 10 September 1842. In Hobson's place the Colonial Office appointed Captain Robert FitzRoy. FitzRoy struggled to keep order between M\u0101ori and settlers keen to buy their land, with very limited financial and military resources at his disposal. Outbreak of the first armed conflicts of the New Zealand Wars and FitzRoy's siding with M\u0101ori claims against the New Zealand Company and its settlers over land deals lead to his recall by the Colonial Office in 1845. \n Passage 2:Meet John Doe is a 1941 American comedy-drama film directed and produced by Frank Capra, and starring Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck. The film is about a \"grassroots\" political campaign created unwittingly by a newspaper columnist with the involvement of a hired homeless man and pursued by the paper's wealthy owner. It became a box office hit and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Story. It was ranked #49 in AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Cheers. In 1969, the film entered the public domain in the United States because the claimants did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication. It was the first of two features Capra made for Warner Brothers, after he left Columbia Pictures. His second film for Warners was an adaptation of the Broadway play Arsenic and Old Lace and was filmed in 1941 but not released until 1944 because the producers of the play wouldn't allow the film to be shown until the production closed.\n Passage 3:According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by BMG Rights Management, \"Goodbye\" is set in common time with a key of E major. The girls' vocals range between G to C. The song has a slow tempo of 68 beats per minute. The song is a ballad which has the girls singing what Sarah Davis at Dotmusic called a \"sugar-coated\" farewell to friend Geri Halliwell, who left the group months prior. Coming to a similar conclusion, Kristie Rohwedder (with Bustle) noted that in the chorus of the song, the Spice Girls sing \"Goodbye my friend/I know you're gone, you said you're gone, but I can still feel you here\" and \"It's not the end/You gotta keep it strong before the pain turns into fear\". \n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

She started training in an import\u2013export business and had the best grades at the vocational school, but felt that it did not suit her. She applied to the Robert Schumann Hochschule for music in D\u00fcsseldorf and was one of seven selected from 200 applicants. Her voice teacher, Michaela Kr\u00e4mer, considered her to be a mezzo-soprano. Radner's father obtained additional voice lessons for her with Jeannette Zarou in D\u00fcsseldorf, and later with mezzo-soprano Marga Schiml, both of whom are experts in early music and Lieder. They recognized that she was really a contralto. Radner's mother died in 2003 after a long illness. Almost a year later, Radner earned her diploma. In the 2006 Bundeswettbewerb Gesang Berlin, she won the \u20ac3,000 third prize in the concert category and a scholarship from the Richard Wagner Society in Bayreuth to attend the 2007 Bayreuth Festival. In the concert division of the 2007 Cantilena Singing Competition, she placed second out of 120 vocalists from 19 countries. In 2008 she played Cornelia in Handel's Giulio Cesare in Egitto at the Theater Hagen. It was to be her only engagement as an ensemble member at a theatre. She decided that it was \"not her world\", not because it was no fun, but because she wanted to earn more, and she went independent. Radner was still a student in 2008 when she made her first public appearance under Zubin Mehta at the Palau de les Arts Reina Sofia in Valencia, singing Martin y Soler's oratorio Philitaei a Jonatha disperse. She gave a recital in June 2008.\n Passage 2:Born in 1921 in Frankenstein, Lower Silesia, Hannig joined the military service in the Luftwaffe as a Fahnenjunker (officer cadet) in October 1939. He was posted to the 6./Jagdgeschwader 54 \"Gr\u00fcnherz\" (JG 54\u201454th fighter wing) in early 1941. His brother, Walter Hannig, received the German Cross in Gold () on 28 April 1943 as an observer with Aufkl\u00e4rungsgruppe (reconnaissance group) 4.(F)/14 of the Luftwaffe. Horst Hannig claimed his first aerial victory, a Tupolev SB-2, on the first day of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941. He achieved his first 30 victories up to November 1941. On 9 May 1942, Leutnant (second Lieutenant) Hannig was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross () having flown over 200 operations and claiming 48 victories. He and Leutnant Hans Bei\u00dfwenger received the Knight's Cross from General der Flieger Helmuth F\u00f6rster at Siverskaya. On 21 July 1942 he claimed his 54th victory, a Petlyakov Pe-2 reconnaissance aircraft, near Lake Ilmen. It was JG\u00a054 2,500th aerial victory.\n Passage 3:The 1991 Polish parliamentary election was held on 27 October 1991 to elect deputies to both houses of the National Assembly. The 1991 election was notable on several counts. It was the first parliamentary election to be held since the formation of the Third Republic, the first entirely free and competitive legislative election since the fall of communism, the first completely free legislative election of any sort since 1928, and only the fifth completely free election in all of Polish history. Due to the collapse of the Solidarity movement's political wing, the 1991 election saw deep political fragmentation, with a multitude of new parties and alliances emerging in its wake. Low voting thresholds within individual constituencies, along with a five percent national threshold allocated to a small portion of the Sejm, additionally contributed to party fragmentation. As a result, 29 political parties gained entry into the Sejm and 22 in the Senate, with no party holding a decisive majority. Two months of intense coalition negotiations followed, with Jan Olszewski of the Centre Agreement forming a minority government along with the Christian National Union, remnants of the broader Center Civic Alliance, and the Peasants' Agreement, with conditional support from Polish People's Party, Solidarity and other minor parties.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Rama Rao came to power defeating the Indian National Congress. He praised the Naxalites for their patriotism before the elections. After coming to power, he demonstrated no significant change in government policy towards the revolutionary movement. Particularly after he was elected for a second time in 1985, his government put all its efforts to suppress the Naxalite movement in the state. Varavara Rao too was subjected to severe repression during this time. Six cases were foisted against him in 1985 alone. In July that year, along with functionaries of other people's organisations, he undertook an all India tour to make the people aware of the repression that was going on in Andhra Pradesh. After visiting Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, New Delhi and Tamil Nadu, Varavara Rao returned to Andhra Pradesh in September to attend court cases. Dr. Ramanatham, a pediatrician and civil liberties activist was a close friend of Varavara Rao. While killing Dr. Ramanatham, and on several other occasions, police openly declared that killing Varavara Rao was their aim. With his life at risk, Varavara Rao could not discharge his duties as Secretary of Virasam and spokesperson of revolutionary literary movement. He was not able to move freely in Andhra Pradesh. Warangal has become a forbidden place for him. Armed and unarmed ruffians and police in civil clothes attacked his house on several occasions. Persecution against his friends in the movement was also mounted. Taking into consideration all these developments, Varavara Rao chose to cancel his bail in Secunderabad Conspiracy Case. On his request, his bail was cancelled and he was sent to jail on 26 December 1985.\n Passage 2:1973\u201374 was a big season for Newcastle United. The new attacking team put together by Harvey was being tipped to take one of the major honours come the season's end. By November Newcastle were second in the league, but they fell away to finish 15th, and in the League Cup they were knocked out in the third round. It was down to the FA Cup. Hendon were first up in the third round and a shock 2\u20132 draw at home meant that Newcastle had to go through a replay at Vicarage Road to see off the non-league side 3\u20130. Scunthorpe United were next up in the fourth round, and another shock 1\u20131 draw at St James' meant another replay against lower league opposition. Macdonald scored twice in the replay to crush Scunthorpe's hopes in a 3\u20130 win. The fifth round saw a difficult away draw to West Bromwich Albion, on a quagmire of a pitch and in front of the TV cameras. Newcastle were majestic, winning 3\u20130 with Macdonald scoring again. Newcastle faced Burnley at Hillsborough in the semi final. Macdonald scored two and Newcastle won 2\u20130; Harvey would sign Burnley defender Geoff Nulty for the next season after impressing in this game. Newcastle United were through to their first FA Cup final since 1955, where they would play Bill Shankly's Liverpool. Newcastle had a poor build up to final with preparations not going to plan: the tracksuit tops the players were meant to be wearing did not turn up, and they had to wear an unkind-looking purple outfit as they walked out at Wembley Stadium. Macdonald was the key man for Newcastle, having scored in every round for a total of eight goals in the competition. Liverpool played well and coasted to a 3\u20130 win with Kevin Keegan scoring twice. It was the end of an era for Harvey; the next season he signed Micky Burns and paid Sheffield Wednesday a club record \u00a3200,000 for Tommy Craig, but Newcastle could only finish a low 15th, despite getting some revenge on Liverpool, beating them 4\u20131 at St James' Park.\n Passage 3:The Ottoman Bosnian leadership led by Husein Grada\u0161\u010devi\u0107 were outraged when Sultan Mahmud II granted Serbia autonomy and subsequently six districts from the Bosnia Eyalet with the Treaty of Adrianople. Husein Grada\u0161\u010devi\u0107 had already begun to support the cause of the fallen Janissary after the Auspicious Incident and would not allow Mahmud II to further disintegrate Bosnian society. Instead of negotiating with Husein Grada\u0161\u010devi\u0107, the Grand Vizier Re\u015fid Mehmed Pasha (already engaged in an aggressive campaign against Albanian pashas and beys) mobilized his Ottoman army towards Travnik. Disappointed by Re\u015fid Pasha's move, Grada\u0161\u010devi\u0107 marched forward with an army of 52,000 into Pri\u0161tina, and later fought and defeated Re\u015fid Pasha at \u0160timlje. A Bosnian delegation reached the Grand Vizier's camp in Skopje in November of that year. The Grand Vizier promised this delegation that he would insist to the Sultan that he accept the Bosniak demands. His true intentions, however, were manifested by early December when his cannons attacked Bosnian units stationed on the outskirts of Novi Pazar. Re\u015fid Mehmed Pasha later began an aggressive campaign into Bosnia with the assistance of the renegade kapetan Ali-pa\u0161a Rizvanbegovi\u0107 and defeated the entire army of Bosnia Eyalet led by Husein Grada\u0161\u010devi\u0107 outside the town of Stup.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

The Carlists were particularly focused on capturing Bilbao, a liberal and economic bastion in northern Spain. The Carlist general Tom\u00e1s de Zumalac\u00e1rregui tried to take the city during the Siege of Bilbao of 1835, but he was wounded during a battle near Bego\u00f1a and died some time after in the town of Zegama.

One of the more famous examples is Playboy's inaugural December 1953 issue that featured photos of Marilyn Monroe from a 1949 photo session as its first Playmate of the Month. The commercialization, promotion, and organized supply of nude celebrity images can be traced to another men's magazine, High Society, and the efforts of its first female Editor, Gloria Leonard. This began as a feature that showcased risqu\u00e9 photos of celebrities like Jodie Foster and Goldie Hawn, usually lifted from film stills, and became a spin-off venture of High Society called Celebrity Skin magazine in 1986. Over its twenty-five year run Margot Kidder, Ann-Margret and Barbra Streisand unsuccessfully attempted to sue the magazine after it published nude photos of them. Yet another magazine earned additional notoriety for its publication of nude photographs of models who at the time were not celebrities, but later attained fame.

He also studied the propagation of monochromatic light waves and their interaction with acoustic waves, i.e., scattering of light with a frequency change, which became known as Brillouin scattering.\n Passage 2:Indian Supercomputer design experience started first with C-DOT's CHIPPS - C-DOT High Performance Parallel Processing System. It was designed to work with a maximum of 192 nodes and later the Technology, Architecture, Design, and the Product's Hardware, Software, and Firmware were transferred to a similarly formed autonomous organization in Pune which was then called 'C-DACT' in the first place to refer to 'Centre for Development of Advanced Computing Technology' as it was intended originally to sound synonymous with C-DOT, but it was later renamed to C-DAC with 5 characters similar to that of C-DOT. CHIPPS was the base platform of the Indian Supercomputer Revolution initiated in 1988 and pursued more vigorously during the start of the 1991. Then, 'CHIPPS' which used Inmos T800 Transputer Architecture and Design in a massively parallel processing structure was augmented and was renamed to call it 'PARAM' by the policy makers of C-DAC though the original architects and the original designers of C-DOT opposed to the renaming process because 'PARAM' refers to GOD in Indian Root Language TAMIL and its ancient versions including Sanskrit. Indian Supercomputer 'PARAM 8000' named by the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), headed by Dr. Vijay Pandurang Bhatkar, was launched on July 1, 1991. It was released in 1991 by C-DAC and was replicated and installed at ICAD Moscow in 1991 under Russian collaboration.\n Passage 3:The 69th Academy Awards ceremony, organized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) took place on March 24, 1997, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles beginning at 6:00\u00a0p.m. PST / 9:00\u00a0p.m. EST. During the ceremony, AMPAS presented the Academy Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in 24 categories honoring films released in 1996. The ceremony, televised in the United States by ABC, was produced by Gil Cates, and directed by Louis J. Horvitz. Actor Billy Crystal hosted the show for the fifth time. He first presided over the 62nd ceremony held in 1990 and had last hosted the 65th ceremony held in 1993. Three weeks earlier, in a ceremony held at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, on March 1, the Academy Awards for Technical Achievement were presented by host Helen Hunt. This also served as the launch event for DVD, with its U.S. launch being on the same day as the ceremony.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:Prior to the 2020 Contest, Slovenia had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest twenty-five times since its first entry in . Slovenia's highest placing in the contest, to this point, has been seventh place, which the nation achieved on two occasions: in 1995 with the song \"Prisluhni mi\" performed by Darja \u0160vajger and in 2001 with the song \"Energy\" performed by Nu\u0161a Derenda. The country's only other top ten result was achieved in 1997 when Tanja Ribi\u010d performing \"Zbudi se\" placed tenth. Since the introduction of semi-finals to the format of the contest in 2004, Slovenia had thus far only managed to qualify to the final on six occasions. In 2018, Slovenia was represented by Lea Sirk and the song \"Hvala, ne!\", which qualified to the final and placed twenty-second. One year later, in 2019, Slovenia qualified for the final again with Zala Kralj & Ga\u0161per \u0160antl, finishing in fifteenth place with the song \"Sebi\".\n Passage 2:\"James Metcalfe - Of the many fine players who figured in Trinity's ranks in the early N.U. days was one who gave outstanding service to the club and in whom the players could always have supreme confidence on the last line of defence. Jimmy Metcalfe soon won recognition as one of the finest full-backs in the country. Born in Cumberland, Jimmy's early football was with Askham-in-Furness (sic Askam-in-Furness), with whom he started in 1890 under R.U. rules. His first club in Yorkshire was Barnsley R.U. and thence to Featherstone. Whilst there, in season 1896-7, he played twice for North v. South - these being R.U. trial matches - and in that season too he figured in all Yorkshire's R.U. county games. It was later - but still in 1897 - that he turned to the Northern Union code and joined Trinity. Here his distinctions were continued and he was a member of the Yorkshire N.U. side which won the County Championship of 1897-8 and again in 1898-9. We can hardly do justice to his fine career in what must necessarily be a short account, but mention must be made of the fact that he played in Trinity's successful Cup Final at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds in 1909, when he was thirty-six years old. And that was not the end. He did not cease to play until 1911 and, in his last match for Trinity gave a final display of his goal-kicking ability by adding three to his wonderful record. Jimmy's record of kicking eleven goals in a match has been equalled twice, but never extended. He set up the record on April 6, 1909, against Bramley at Belle Vue. Trinity's score was 11-15-67 to 2-2-10.\" \n Passage 3:Morton was a prolific photographer who took photographs of all aspects of life in North Carolina. His first published photograph came in 1935, when he was 14; a picture he took of a golfing scene was published as a North Carolina travel advertisement in Time Magazine. During his time at the University of North Carolina, he was a photographer for the student newspaper, the Daily Tar Heel. During World War II, Morton joined as a member of the Signal Corps, where he was assigned the job of newsreel photographer. He was sent to New Caledonia, an island off the coast of Australia, where he was attached to the 37th Infantry Division. Near the end of the war, Morton was assigned to take pictures of General Douglas MacArthur when MacArthur's regular photographer was sick. While on the island of Luzon in the Philippines, Morton was injured by a Japanese explosive and was awarded the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

In October 1914 he became a commander of a platoon of a squadron in . During the fighting in 1914\u20131915 he was promoted to lieutenant, and after the war he was awarded the V-Class Virtuti Militari. In August 1915 he moved to the special group in Warsaw. Soon he became an aide-de-camp to J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski. In 1918, he was sent on a mission to Russia. He was given three tasks; to persuade General J\u00f3zef Haller's army, then in the Ukraine, to back Pi\u0142sudski (he failed in this task), to reach the French military mission in Moscow under General Lavergne (he succeeded in this task) and to return from Moscow to Paris to liaise with the government there. Unfortunately he was arrested by the Soviet Cheka as a member of the Polish Military Organisation while on a French diplomatic train on its way from Moscow to Murmansk (and Paris). He was imprisoned in the Taganka prison. He was freed thanks to the intervention of his future wife Bronis\u0142awa Wieniawa-D\u0142ugoszowska with the much feared Cheka operative Yakovleva, then in charge of the prison. Bronis\u0142awa was at that time married to the lawyer , the lawyer of Felix Dzerzhinsky, the head of the Cheka. She was a Lutheran, her family having converted from the Jewish faith when she was eight.\n Passage 2:John Silvester, the Recorder of London referenced the spectre of Napoleon Bonaparte and the burgeoning Napoleonic Wars in his announcement of Perring's appointment, stating that \"At a time so awful as the present, when the country is threatened by an implacable and unprincipled enemy, it is of the last importance that the civic chair should be filled by a person in whom the greatest confidence can be placed\". Silvester ominously warned Perring that \"The keys of the Metropolis are placed in your hands, at the moment when the enemy are at the gates\". The ball held later that day at Guildhall was opened with a minuet danced by Perring's eldest daughter and the Spanish Ambassador. The Napoleonic wars and the threat of a French invasion had led to coastal batteries being built as fortifications along the south coast of England in the summer of 1803. Perring was furious to find that a battery had been built on land that he owned at the mouth of the River Yealm in Devon, and wrote to the Secretary of War, Lord Hobart. Perring was eventually pacified by many letters from John Graves Simcoe, who was in charge of the construction of the defences. With the threat of invasion by the French still present, Perring presented the colours of the Corporation of London to the ten regiments of the London Loyal Infantry who assembled at Blackheath on 18 May 1804. Perring was accompanied on the grand procession to Blackheath by the Earl of Harrington, Earl Amherst and Prince Frederick, Duke of York.\n Passage 3:Born in Bonn, Germany, into a family of Jewish ancestry, Kuttner was raised as a Lutheran and converted to Roman Catholicism in 1932.

Two years later he fled Nazi Germany for Italy, where he worked as a research fellow at the Vatican Library and taught at the Lateran University in Rome. In 1940, he emigrated to the United States with his young family. He was a professor at Washington, D.C.'s Catholic University of America from 1940 to 1964, where a chair in canon law is named in his honor. At Yale University he was the first occupant of the T.

Passage 1:This extended training period meant that he had accumulated 138 flying hours in his pilot's logbook before he finally joined No. 66 Squadron RFC in Italy on 10 March 1918. He was assigned to \"C\" Flight, flying a Sopwith Camel single seat fighter, and became the preferred wingman of fellow Canadian ace Billy Barker. Birks' first aerial victory came on 18 March, when he destroyed a Rumpler reconnaissance aircraft over Pravisdomini, killing an Austro-Hungarian pilot named Shneeberger. Six days later, he set another reconnaissance aircraft on fire, killing the crew of Poelzi and Suski. His third victory would not come until 2 May, when he wounded Leutnant K. Kosiuski and drove him into a crash landing that destroyed his Albatros D.V. Two days later, Birks shot down and killed ace Oberleutnant Karl Patzelt, as well as F. Frisch. In addition to killing both Austro-Hungarian pilots, he destroyed both their Albatros D.Vs; they were credited as \"captured\" because they fell within Italian lines. The new ace shot down another D.V in flames a week later, on 11 May. He destroyed two Berg fighters in five minutes on a morning patrol on 19 May. The following day, he destroyed another. On 24 May, while flying with Barker, Birks was credited with shooting down Hungarian ace J\u00f3zsef Kiss of Flik 55J; Birks thus became a double ace. On 9 June Birks set another Albatros D.V on fire in mid-air. On the 21st, he capped his list of triumphs by destroying another D.V over Motta. Most unusually for a British pilot, he had no \"soft\" victories, such as \"driven down out of control\".\n Passage 2:In 1658 Hungerford was elected Member of Parliament for Chippenham in the Third Protectorate Parliament. He was elected MP for Chippenham in 1660 for the Convention Parliament. He was made a Knight of the Bath at the coronation of King Charles II on 23 April 1661. In 1661 he was elected for Chippenham again in the Cavalier Parliament but the election was declared void. He was then re-elected in the by-election later in 1661 and also in the two elections in 1679. In January 1680 he presented a petition for the summoning of a parliament, and his avowed opposition to the court party of King Charles II led to his removal as Lord Lieutenant of his county in May 1681. He settled in Spring Gardens, Whitehall, in 1681 and was elected MP for Chippenham again in the Oxford Parliament of 1681. He was implicated in the 1683 Rye House Plot and his home at Farleigh Castle was searched for arms.

The Canadian Football League's annual championship, the Grey Cup, is one of the country's largest annual sports events. While other sports have a larger spectator base, Association football, known in Canada as soccer in both English and French, has the most registered players of any team sport in Canada. Professional teams exist in many cities in Canada.

Noted R&B vocalist and Tampa native King Coleman got his start as a DJ on WTMP in the 1950s. In the late 1990s, the station, then-owned by Broadcast Capital, was bought by Tama Broadcasting, which has headquarters in Tampa, thus making WTMP the flagship. Long controlled by the Cherry family, Tama also owns stations in Daytona Beach, Jacksonville, Savannah, Georgia and Greenville, South Carolina; it owns newspapers in Daytona Beach and Fort Pierce. The owner went on to buy the then-WGUL in 2002 and made it a hip hop-urban station (and home to Russ Parr in the Morning) as WTMP-FM. Even after a format change to rhythmic oldies, that station did not do well due to its rimshot signal, so it ended up as a simulcast of WTMP a year later. The rimshot signal, which barely reaches the Hillsborough County line from its transmitter southeast of Brooksville, also couldn't be moved closer to Tampa or upgraded with changes to the tower or transmitter power, due to interference issues with other stations broadcasting on 96.1 and nearby frequencies.\n Passage 2:Shah Nawaz Bhutto, a direct descendant of Muhammad Khan, came to prominence during the British Raj as a dewan of the princely state of Junagadh in south-western Gujarat in India.

Galeazzo Ciano was Benito Mussolini's son-in-law. He served between June 1936 and his sacking by Mussolini on 5 February 1943 as Foreign Minister. Following the Grand Council vote of 24 July 1943 in which Ciano joined with the majority and opposed his father-in-law, voting to invite King Victor Emmanuel III to \"resume his full constitutional powers\", and the ensuing political take-over by General Pietro Badoglio, Ciano was on the receiving end of a vicious press campaign, deprived of a passport, and kept under virtual house arrest at his home in Italy. He began to fear for his personal safety and that of his family. On 27 August 1943 German intelligence arranged for Ciano and his family to be transported to Ciampino airfield, while avoiding the Italian police. Ciano was picked up by one car while his wife Edda and their three children were taken while walking in the park, by a different route, by another car, to a pre-assigned meeting point in the city where they were placed in a German army truck for the airport transfer. From Ciampino they were flown to Munich on board a Luftwaffe Ju 52 transport. What Ciano regarded as his escape was organised personally by Beetz's new boss Wilhelm H\u00f6ttl. For H\u00f6ttl and German Intelligence, the over-riding objective of the \"Ciano operation\" was to obtain Ciano's diaries and extensive supporting papers concerning his years at the heart of Italy's political establishment, which the German government feared might include incriminating or embarrassing information about relations between the two governments or, indeed, about the German foreign minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop (whom Ciano was known to hate). \n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

At the level of colonel, in 2009, he served at the director of training for the UPDF 2nd Division, based at Mbarara, in Western Uganda. From 2010 until 2011, he served as the Chief of Staff of AMISOM, based in Mogadishu, Somalia. On his return from Somalia, he was posted to the 4th UPDF Division headquarters in Gulu, as the commanding officer. He later was appointed chief of personnel and administration in the UPDF, based at the Mbuya Barracks. In January 2014, he was elected to the Parliament of Uganda, as a UPDF representative. In November 2014, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier, along with more than 1,300 UPDF officers who received promotions at the same time.\n Passage 3:In early 1920 he commanded a military mission which supervised the withdrawal of Romanian Forces left in Hungary after the Hungarian\u2013Romanian War of 1919, and in the summer was attached to the force occupying \u0130zmit, Turkey, as it prepared to withdraw. His third overseas posting of the year was to Persia in late August, where \u2013 among other things \u2013 he appointed Reza Khan (after ousting the Russian officer Vsevolod Starosselsky and having his offered position declined by Sardar Homayoun) to command the \u00e9lite Cossack Brigade; Reza Khan would later seize control of the country, and rule as Shah from 1925 to 1941. The precise level of British involvement in Reza Khan's coup remains a matter of historical debate, but it is almost certain that Ironside himself at least provided advice to the plotters. On his departure from Persia in 1921, the Shah awarded him the Order of the Lion and the Sun.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

In the same year, her family left Colorado and moved to Orland, California, since the lower elevation there was expected to benefit her father's health. However, her father suffered setbacks in his business, and facing both blindness and tuberculosis, he committed suicide in 1917. Kracaw enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1915. She considered majoring in economics and English literature before deciding on psychology. She made a number of lifelong friends during her undergraduate years, including Jean Macfarlane, whose interest in psychology drove Kracaw to select that discipline for her major. She graduated cum laude in 1921, and began graduate study at UC Berkeley. Her Master's thesis studied ten families in San Francisco that had been clients of a juvenile court. She volunteered as a probation officer, and was required to meet and report on the families she was studying. She would later write that she struggled to be objective in writing about these families. Kracaw received her Master's degree in clinical psychology in 1920.\n Passage 2:Matthew William Goode (born 3 April 1978) is an English character actor. He made his screen debut in 2002 with ABC's TV film feature Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister. His breakthrough role was in the romantic comedy, Chasing Liberty (2004), for which he received a nomination at Teen Choice Awards for Choice Breakout Movie Star \u2013 Male. He then appeared in a string of supporting roles in films like Woody Allen's Match Point (2005), the German-British romantic comedy Imagine Me and You (2006), and the period drama Copying Beethoven (2006).

He then starred in romantic comedy Leap Year (2010) and Australian drama Burning Man (2011), the latter earning him a nomination for Best Actor at the Film Critics Circle of Australia Awards.\n Passage 3:The club was formed in 1899 and turned professional after joining the Midland League in 1912. Crowned Midland League champions in the 1926\u201327 and 1938\u201339 campaigns, they were elected into the Football League in 1950. They went on to secure promotion as champions of the Third Division North in 1957\u201358 and spent six seasons in the Second Division, before they were relegated in 1964 and then down to the Fourth Division in 1968.

Passage 1:Beginning with the 2000 election, the status of the Missouri bellwether came into question. Between 1904 and 2004, Missouri was carried by the victor of each presidential election, with the exception of 1956. Though Bush won the presidency in the 2000 election through the Electoral College, he lost the national popular vote. The 2000 election was unique because this was the first time in over a century where the popular vote winner lost the general election. (In 1888, Missouri voted for Grover Cleveland, the incumbent Democrat, who lost to Republican candidate Benjamin Harrison). Thus, controversy exists as to whether or not Missouri accurately predicted victor in this election. In the subsequent election, Missouri voted for George W. Bush, who this time won both the popular vote and the Electoral College. Missouri has voted reliably Republican since 2000. The state voted for John McCain in 2008, and for Mitt Romney in 2012, both of whom lost the general election to Barack Obama. The controversy is further complicated by the 2016 presidential election, where Missouri voted for Donald Trump by a landslide, while Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly three million votes, but like in 2000, Trump won the Electoral College and became 45th President of the United States. Like 2000, political scientists have differing opinions on whether or not Missouri accurately predicted the victor, and even if Missouri is still a bellwether state at all.\n Passage 2:Minimal music is a form of art music that employs limited or minimal musical materials. In the Western art music tradition, the American composers La Monte Young, Terry Riley, Steve Reich, and Philip Glass are credited with being among the first to develop compositional techniques that exploit a minimal approach. It originated in the New York Downtown scene of the 1960s and was initially viewed as a form of experimental music called the New York Hypnotic School. As an aesthetic, it is marked by a non-narrative, non-teleological, and non-representational conception of a work in progress, and represents a new approach to the activity of listening to music by focusing on the internal processes of the music, which lack goals or motion toward those goals. Prominent features of the technique include consonant harmony, hypnotic rhythmic pulses or steady drones, stasis or gradual transformation, and often reiteration of musical phrases or smaller units such as figures, motifs, and cells. It may include features such as additive process and phase shifting. Phase-shifting leads to what has been termed phase music. Minimal compositions that rely heavily on process techniques that follow strict rules are usually described as process music.\n Passage 3:In 1950, Yost posted career-highs with a .295 batting average and a .440\u00a0on-base percentage. In 1951 he led the American League with 36\u00a0doubles and produced a career-high 65 runs batted in. He earned a place as a reserve player for the American League team in the 1952 All-Star Game. Between August 30, 1949 and May 11, 1955, Yost played in 829 consecutive games for the Senators, the ninth longest consecutive game streak in major league history. Yost's home run totals were diminished by having to play his home games in Washington's cavernous Griffith Stadium.

Passage 1:At the time, the Turkish Minister of Family and Social Policies, Fatma Bet\u00fcl Sayan Kaya, was touring Germany. A visit to the Dutch town of Hengelo, close to the German border, had already been scheduled. On 11 March, the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service received information that Kaya would try to reach Rotterdam by car. She could freely cross the border because of the Schengen Treaty. A crisis centre was established on the twenty-third floor of the Rotterdam World Port Center to coordinate police actions. Earlier, the Turkish consul in Rotterdam had indicated to the Mayor of Rotterdam, Ahmed Aboutaleb, that there were no plans for such a visit. It now proved impossible to contact the consul, which gave Aboutaleb the conviction that the consul knew of Kaya's attempt. A motorcade was intercepted but the car with the minister managed to drive away. It reached a small yard at the rear of the Turkish consulate. The Dutch police stopped Bet\u00fcl Sayan Kaya's entourage just metres from the Turkish consulate building. About twenty police officers, forming a special forces unit, the Dienst Speciale Interventies, masked and equipped with body armour and automatic weapons, arrested ten members of Kaya's bodyguard, on suspicion of illegally carrying firearms. A German source had indicated they had obtained a German weapons permit. No arms were discovered. Two other men were also arrested, who later proved to be the Deventer Turkish consul and the charg\u00e9 d'affaires of the Turkish embassy. They in principle enjoyed diplomatic immunity. The twelve arrested men were detained for two hours and their passports were seized. A stand-off ensued for several hours in which the Turkish minister refused to leave the car. Just after midnight, a special heavy tow truck, a lift flatbed, was driven into the yard and prepared to vertically hoist the 3.5 tonne car onto the flatbed, with the minister still in it, to transport her back to Germany. The minister now left the car and demanded entrance to the consulate invoking the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. The Dutch police had orders to arrest the minister if necessary. Ultimately, she gave in to the police demands to leave the country. At the time, many news sources assumed that she had been declared persona non grata. She was, loudly protesting, taken to another car, a black armoured Mercedes, by masked Dutch police officers who accompanied her to a police station at Nijmegen near the Dutch\u2013German border. Her passport was seized. She was not allowed to leave the station for one and a half hours, while being reunited with the ten bodyguards. She returned to Germany under German escort. Sporadic rioting occurred among the about a thousand pro-Erdo\u011fan protesters who had come to the Turkish consulate. They were met by Dutch riot police, who arrested twelve people for violent assault and not following police instructions. Kaya's passport was returned on 12 March, 18:00, to the Turkish consul. In April 2017, Kaya's lawyer said they would file a complaint against the Dutch government at court claiming that her expulsion from the Netherlands was illegal because she was not given a written statement of the reasons for the expulsion. However, on 2 May the case was dropped when it transpired that Kaya had never been formally declared persona non grata and that from a judicial point of view she had left the Netherlands voluntarily.\n Passage 2:His grandfather was architect Alexandros Tzonis who designed many buildings in Thessaloniki during the Interwar period. Tzonis studied architecture at the National Technical University of Athens (1956 -1961). During the period of his university studies, he was instructed privately in mathematics (Pandelis Rokos) and art (Spyros Papaloukas) meeting regularly with the architect Dimitris Pikionis who was by then retired from teaching. He worked professionally as a stage designer in the theatre and art director in the cinema. (Never on Sunday, 1960 directed by Jules Dassin). In 1961 he moved to the United States as a Ford Fellow, where he pursued his studies at Yale University, briefly in the Drama School and soon after in the School of Art and Architecture under Paul Rudolph, Shadrach Woods, Robert Venturi, and Serge Chermayeff. In 1965, with sponsorship from the Twentieth Century Fund he was appointed fellow at Yale where he carried out pioneering research on Planning and Design Methodology in collaboration with Chermayeff with whom he co-authored The Shape of Community (1972). In 1968 he was invited to teach at the Graduate School of Design at Harvard University by Jerzy Soltan and Josep Lluis Sert appointed assistant professor. There he taught and did advanced research in analytical design methods in association with Walter Isard and Ovadia Salama, receiving outside advice from Anatol Rapaport and Seymour Papert. In collaboration with Ovadia Salama, introducing the newly developed method ELECTRE he worked out a new method for multi-criteria evaluation of architectural projects (1975). In collaboration with Michael Freeman, Etienne de Cointet, and his undergraduate student Robert Berwick, who became later professor of computational linguistics at MIT, he developed a method for design discourse analysis applied to the case of 17th and 18th century texts of French architectural theory, a project funded by the French Government carried out at Harvard and in France (1975).\n Passage 3:In 1870, Charles F. Dowd proposed four time zones based on the meridian through Washington, DC for North American railroads. In 1872. he revised his proposal to base it on the Greenwich meridian. Sandford Fleming, a Scottish-born engineer operating in Canada, proposed worldwide Standard Time at a meeting of the Royal Canadian Institute on February 8, 1879. Cleveland Abbe advocated standard time to better coordinate international weather observations and resultant weather forecasts, which had been coordinated using local solar time. In 1879 he recommended four time zones across the contiguous United States, based upon Greenwich Mean Time. The General Time Convention (renamed the American Railway Association in 1891), an organization of US railroads charged with coordinating schedules and operating standards, became increasingly concerned that if the US government adopted a standard time scheme it would be disadvantageous to its member railroads. William F. Allen, the Convention secretary, argued that North American railroads should adopt a five-zone standard, similar to the one in use today, to avoid government action. On October 11, 1883, the heads of the major railroads met in Chicago at the Grand Pacific Hotel and agreed to adopt Allen's proposed system.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:The 1978 NBA draft was the 32nd annual draft of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The draft was held on June 9, 1978, before the 1978\u201379 season. In this draft, 22 NBA teams took turns selecting amateur U.S. college basketball players and other eligible players, including international players. The first two picks in the draft belonged to the teams that finished last in each conference, with the order determined by a coin flip. The Indiana Pacers won the coin flip and were awarded the first overall pick, while the Kansas City Kings, who obtained the New Jersey Nets' first-round pick in a trade, were awarded the second pick. The Pacers then traded the first pick to the Portland Trail Blazers before the draft. The remaining first-round picks and the subsequent rounds were assigned to teams in reverse order of their win\u2013loss record in the previous season. A player who had finished his four-year college eligibility was eligible for selection. If a player left college early, he would not be eligible for selection until his college class graduated. Before the draft, five college underclassmen were declared eligible for selection under the \"hardship\" rule. These players had applied and gave evidence of financial hardship to the league, which granted them the right to start earning their living by starting their professional careers earlier. Prior to the start of the season, the Buffalo Braves relocated to San Diego and became the San Diego Clippers. The draft consisted of 10 rounds comprising the selection of 202 players.\n Passage 2:Thirty-five of the listed players have played for only one franchise. Four of those players played exclusively for the Montreal Canadiens and five played for the Detroit Red Wings, those teams having the most such players. The record for most teams played for by a player who has competed in over 1,000 games is held by Mike Sillinger, who played for 12 teams in his career; Sillinger played his 1,000th game with his 12th and final NHL team, the New York Islanders. Patrick Roy, Martin Brodeur and Roberto Luongo are the only goaltenders with at least 1,000 games played. Roy spent his career with the Montreal Canadiens and the Colorado Avalanche while Brodeur played for the New Jersey Devils and his final seven games with the St. Louis Blues. Luongo played for the New York Islanders, Florida Panthers and Vancouver Canucks in his career. The first goaltender was Patrick Roy, playing in his 1000th game in the 2002\u201303 season.\n Passage 3:Heughan was born on 30 April 1980 in Balmaclellan, in the historical county of Kirkcudbrightshire in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland. At the age of five, he moved to nearby New Galloway where he attended Kells Primary School. During this time, he lived in converted stables in the grounds of Kenmure Castle. Moving to Edinburgh at the age of twelve, he attended James Gillespie's High School for a year and then moved to the Edinburgh Rudolf Steiner School until the end of the sixth year. He subsequently spent two years working and travelling, before enrolling at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (now the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland) in Glasgow, graduating in 2003. During his schooling, he performed in numerous plays, including The Twits at Citizens Theatre, an adaptation of Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime & Punishment, Anton Chekhov's The Seagull, Aeschylus' Greek tragedy Prometheus Bound, and Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet.

The following week, at WrestleMania VII, he came to the aid of the Boss Man in his match against Mr. Perfect. Roussimoff finally returned to action on April 26, 1991, in a six-man tag-team matchup when he teamed with the Rockers in a winning effort against Mr. Fuji and the Orient Express at a house show in Belfast, Northern Ireland. On May 10 he participated in a 17-man battle-royal at a house show in Detroit. (won by Kerry Von Erich) Making it his last WWF match. His last major WWF storyline following WrestleMania VII had the major heel managers (Bobby Heenan, Sensational Sherri, Slick, and Mr. Fuji) trying to recruit Roussimoff one-by-one, only to be turned down in various humiliating ways (e.g. Heenan had his hand crushed, Sherri received a spanking, Slick got locked in the trunk of the car he was offering to Roussimoff and Mr. Fuji got a pie in his face). Finally, Jimmy Hart appeared live on WWF Superstars to announce that he had successfully signed Roussimoff to tag-team with Earthquake. However, when asked to confirm this by Gene Okerlund, Roussimoff denied the claims. This led to Earthquake's attacking Roussimoff from behind (injuring his knee). Jimmy Hart would later get revenge for the humiliation by secretly signing Tugboat and forming the Natural Disasters. This led to Roussimoff's final major WWF appearance at SummerSlam '91, where he seconded the Bushwhackers in their match against the Disasters. Roussimoff was on crutches at ringside, and after the Disasters won the match, they set out to attack him, but the Legion of Doom made their way to ringside and got in between them and the Giant, who was preparing to defend himself with one of his crutches. The Disasters left the ringside area as they were outnumbered by the Legion of Doom, the Bushwhackers and Roussimoff, who struck both Earthquake and Typhoon (the former Tugboat) with the crutch as they left. His final WWF appearance came at a house show in Paris, France, on October 9. He was in Davey Boy Smith's corner as the Bulldog faced Earthquake. Davey Boy hit Earthquake with Roussimoff's crutch, allowing Smith to win.\n Passage 2:The chimera of Greek mythology appeared in Marvel Comics. It is depicted as a fire-breathing monster with the heads of a lion and a goat next to each other, the front legs of a lion, the wings of a dragon, the hindquarters of a goat, and a snake-headed tail, while also possessing the power of speech. Its history of being the offspring of Echidna and being slain by Bellerophon is still mentioned. At some point, the Chimera was restored to life by Hera to guard the caverns underneath New Olympus. It was accompanied in this job by a Cyclops and some Skeleton Warriors. The Chimera encountered the Agents of Atlas. When it didn't see that they were Olympians, Chimera breathed fire at them, sparking a fight between the heroes and the minions of Hera.

His grandfather, Pandit Nandlal Nehru, was the elder brother of Pandit Motilal Nehru. He was the cousin to the erstwhile Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi (n\u00e9e Nehru). In 1935, Nehru married Magdolna Friedman (5 December 1908, Budapest, Austria-Hungary - 25 April 2017, Kasauli, Himachal Pradesh, India), a fellow student in the UK who was of an Austrian Jewish background.

He had four sons named Aditya Nehru, Ashok Nehru and Anil Nehru.\n Passage 2:Bermondsey was historically a rural parish on the outskirts of London until the 17th century when the area began to be developed as a wealthy suburb following the Great Fire of London. By the 19th century, the once affluent parts of Bermondsey had experienced a serious decline, and became the site of notorious slums with the arrival of industrialisation, docks and migrant housing, especially along the riverside. The most notorious of the slums was known as Jacob's Island, with the boundary approximately the confluence of the Thames and subterranean River Neckinger, at St Saviour's Dock across from Shad Thames, to the west, a tidal ditch just west of George Row to the east, and another tidal ditch just north of London Street (now Wolseley Street) to the south.

Passage 1:He had an exceptional gift for languages and mastered Latin and Greek very early; in his edition of Rhodanthe et Dosicl\u00e8s, he included a Greek poem that he wrote when he was 16 years old. In 1615, his friend Jacques-Philippe de Maussac, in dedicating his De lapidum virtutibus to Gaulmin, called him a \u201cpentaglot,\u201d knowing, besides Latin and Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, and Turkish. In 1639, Scottish mathematician James Hume, comparing Gaulmin to Pico della Mirandola, praised him for also knowing Persian and Armenian. In 1648, Balthazar Gerbier also credited him with the knowledge of Italian and Spanish. He learned Arabic first with \u00c9tienne Hubert, royal physician and professor of Arabic at the Coll\u00e8ge de France, and then under Gabriel Sionita, a Maronite who arrived in Paris in 1614 and who succeeded Hubert. Gaulmin was taught Hebrew by a converted Jewish man, Philippe d'Aquin, who in 1610 was named a professor of Hebrew at the Coll\u00e8ge de France.

His main emphasis was on the benefit of free internal and international trade, which he thought could increase wealth through specialisation in production. He also opposed restrictive trade preferences, state grants of monopolies and employers' organisations and trade unions. Government should be limited to defence, public works and the administration of justice, financed by taxes based on income. Smith was one of the progenitors of the idea, which was long central to classical liberalism and has resurfaced in the globalisation literature of the later 20th and early 21st centuries, that free trade promotes peace. Smith's economics was carried into practice in the 19th century with the lowering of tariffs in the 1820s, the repeal of the Poor Relief Act that had restricted the mobility of labour in 1834 and the end of the rule of the East India Company over India in 1858.\n Passage 3:The first mention of modern H\u00e4gglingen is in 1036 when Count Ulrich von Lenzburg granted the church and farm of Hekelingen to Berom\u00fcnster. In the acknowledgments of Emperor Henry III in 1045, the village of Hackelingen was mentioned. Frederick I Barbarossa acknowledged the grants to the village in 1173. The Vogtei (bailiwick) went from the Lenzburg family to the Kyburgs and then in 1273 to the Lords of Hallwyl. The high court rights were exercised by the Habsburgs until the Swiss conquered the Aargau in 1415. It was not until 1425 that H\u00e4gglingen, which was claimed by Lucerne, came under the authority of the entire Confederacy. It was first assigned to the district court of Wohlenschwil before it became an independent municipality from 1435-1712.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:Penson's professional career began in April 1954 after he had had a successful three-year skein as a pitcher while he served in the military. Penson won 50 games pitching for his base team, although sources disagree about the branch in which he served, reported as the United States Air Force and the U.S. Army. Penson made the Phillies out of training camp in 1954 as a member of the team's early-season, 28-man roster. His five games pitched included three starts, and he split two decisions. His lone MLB win came in his first start, on Sunday, May 16, 1954. in the second game of a doubleheader at Connie Mack Stadium. He went six innings against the St. Louis Cardinals, and allowed four hits, four bases on balls, and one earned run. But he was forced to leave the game leading 6\u20133 when the game was suspended because of Pennsylvania blue laws prohibiting sporting events on Sunday evenings. The game resumed on Monday, May 17, and Philadelphia went on to win, 8\u20134; veteran Murry Dickson nailed down the save with three innings of one-run relief.\n Passage 2:Racing during the Great Depression of the 1930s, Bunty Lawless competed for purse money that was very small. At age two, he finished first or second in all but one of his ten races. The one time he was out of the money that year was in the Cup and Saucer Stakes, when his equipment broke. In 1938, the horse was the top 3-year-old in Canada, and his victory in the King's Plate, his country's most prestigious race, was enormously popular with the public. In an era when millionaires still dominated Thoroughbred horse racing, the owner and breeder of Bunty Lawless was the opposite. The working man's hero, Willie Morrissey grew up penniless in the poorest section of Toronto, worked as a newsboy, then became a successful hotel owner and boxing promoter. At the race track, he sat in the cheap grandstand seats with the rest of the crowd and was frowned upon by the aristocratic elite owners in their top hats and tails, seated in their exclusive viewing boxes.\n Passage 3:The Ohio Country located between Britain's Thirteen Colonies and France's New France saw France and Britain clash. In 1753 the French sent an expedition south from Montreal that began constructing forts in the upper reaches of the Ohio River. In 1754 the Province of Virginia sent the Virginia Regiment led by George Washington to the area to assist in the construction of a British fort at present-day Pittsburgh, but the larger French force had driven away a smaller British advance party and built Fort Duquesne. Washington and some native allies ambushed a company of French scouts at the Battle of Jumonville Glen in late May 1754. In the skirmish the French envoy Joseph Coulon de Jumonville was left dead leading to a diplomatic incident. The French responded in force from Fort Duquesne, and in July Washington was forced to surrender at the Battle of Fort Necessity. Despite the conflict between them, the two nations were not yet formally at war.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Bass and Honky co-captained a five-man contingent against a team captained by Beefcake and the Ultimate Warrior at the second Survivor Series in November. Bass and teammate Greg Valentine were eliminated by Warrior in succession in the final minute of the match. On the January 7, 1989 Saturday Night's Main Event XIX, Bass lost to Beefcake via sleeperhold in a hair vs. hair match. He competed in the 1989 Royal Rumble (sans hair), Bass' feud with Beefcake was scrapped, and he was used mainly as a preliminary wrestler and left the WWF shortly thereafter.\n Passage 2:In humans C. hepatica causes Hepatic capillariasis, a serious liver disorder. The Nematode wanders through the host liver causing loss of liver cells and thereby loss of function. However, as the adult C. hepatica begin to die in the liver tissue, their decomposition accelerates the immune response of the host. This response leads to chronic inflammation and Encapsulation of the dead worms in collagen fibers, and eventually to septal fibrosis (abnormal connective tissue growth) and cirrhosis of the liver. This leaves the eggs behind and they can become encased by Granulomatous tissue, with large sections of the Parenchyma becoming replaced by these egg masses. Capillaria hepatica can also cause Hepatomegaly. Infections of C. hepatica can present with several clinical symptoms including, abdominal pain in the liver area, weight loss, decreased appetite, fever and chills, hepatitis (liver inflammation), ascites (excess fluid in the peritoneal cavity) and hepatolithiasis (gallstones in the bile ducts).\n Passage 3:Traditional African religions like the Serer religion (A \u01adat Roog) are adhered to by devout worshippers of Roog \u2013 the supreme deity in Serer religion. The Serer ethnic group who adhere to the tenets of Serer religion (including those Senegalese who syncretize) honour the Serer pangool and have ancient rituals and festivals devoted to them. The religious affairs of Serer religion devotees are usually headed by the Saltigue (the Serer priestly class) which in ancient times was the preoccupation of the Serer lamanic class. Some of these religious festivals or ceremonies include the Ndut (rite of passage), Xooy (divination festival once a year in Fatick), and the Raan festival. Senegalese hold several ancient beliefs, such as small efforts of 'thanks' or demands, such as protection from water. They also place great importance on the Baobab tree, which is known as the \"House of the Spirits.\" The baobab tree along with other sacred trees figure prominently in the Serer creation narrative.

The system developed into Tropical Depression Six at 12:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a028, while located about 60\u00a0mi (100\u00a0km) southwest of Cape San Blas, Florida. The depression combined with a building high pressure system, resulting in the development of a strong convergence zone. This, in turn, caused heavy rainfall along the Gulf Coast, particularly in southern Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. With sustained winds initially at 25\u00a0mph (35\u00a0km/h), the storm intensified slightly while tracking west-northwestward. Early on July\u00a029, the depression attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1010\u00a0mbar (29.83\u00a0inHg). Several hours later, it made landfall in a rural area of St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, with winds of 30\u00a0mph (45\u00a0km/h). The system curved northwestward and dissipated at 12:00\u00a0UTC on July\u00a030, shortly after crossing into Mississippi.

After coming to power, he demonstrated no significant change in government policy towards the revolutionary movement. Particularly after he was elected for a second time in 1985, his government put all its efforts to suppress the Naxalite movement in the state.

In 586 his troops defeated them at the Battle of Solachon south of Dara. In 588, a mutiny by unpaid Byzantine troops against their new commander, Priscus, seemed to offer the Sassanids a chance for a breakthrough, but the mutineers themselves repulsed the ensuing Persian offensive. Later in the year they secured a major victory before Martyropolis. The Sassanid commander, Maruzas, was killed, several of the Persian leaders were captured along with 3,000 other prisoners, and only a thousand men survived to reach refuge at Nisibis.

They eventually settled in Chicago, where young Ptacek was first exposed to blues music. He moved to Tucson in the early 1970s, where he began his own musical career, most often solo, but sometimes he plugged in and led a trio as Rainer & Das Combo. He co-founded Giant Sandworms with Howe Gelb in the late 1970s. When the band decided to move to New York and became Giant Sand, Ptacek opted to stay in Tucson to make sure that he would not disrupt his then-new family. Although he never became well known in the United States, he became more and more recognized in Europe. ZZ Top guitarist Billy Gibbons was so impressed with the singer-guitarist that he arranged to have Kurt Loder review Ptacek's \"Mush Mind Blues\" cassette in Rolling Stone. Ptacek later traveled to Houston at the invitation of Billy Gibbons to record at Gibbons' Gold Star Sound Services studio which saw release as \"The Texas Tapes\" meeting international attention and approval. Robert Plant, similarly impressed, flew Ptacek to England for the sessions for B-sides to supplement the singles from Fate of Nations.\n Passage 2:When Isabella first became queen, she was only three years old. The queen mother, Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies, served as regent. The first and foremost political division of the Isabeline era was between Carlists and Cristinos (or Isabelinos), the former being supporters of Infante Carlos, Count of Molina, a rival claimant to the throne and the latter being supporters of Maria Christina and Isabella. The former supported absolute monarchism and the traditionalism of the Antiguo R\u00e9gimen (\"Old Regime\"); they were uniformly close to the Roman Catholic Church, and generally clericalist. The latter were generally supporters of constitutional monarchy (although some, including Maria Christina herself, were more inclined toward enlightened absolutism); they were liberals of one stripe or another, ranging from liberal conservatives and those whose liberalism was strictly economic to social liberals. In the 1830s, these two groups faced off in the First Carlist War, which the Cristinos won. The terms of surrender\u2014notably the Convention of Vergara\u2014left an opportunity for relatively moderate Carlists to continue to play a role in the country's politics, and many did so over the ensuing decades.\n Passage 3:Secretary of State for Employment and Productivity Barbara Castle introduced an Employed Persons (Health and Safety) Bill in 1970 but the debate around the Bill soon generated a belief that it did not address fundamental issues of workplace safety. In the same year, the Occupational Safety and Health Act was passed into United States federal law. As a result, a committee of inquiry chaired by Lord Robens was established towards the end of Harold Wilson's first government. When the Conservative Party came to power following the 1970 United Kingdom general election, they gave Castle's Bill no parliamentary time, preferring to wait for the Robens Report which was published in 1972. Conservative Secretary of State for Employment William Whitelaw introduced a new Bill on 28 January 1974 but Labour were returned to power in the February 1974 United Kingdom general election and the Bill again lost.

Between 1530-1539 he was also the deputy of the King and after his death he remained with his widow, Isabella Jagiellon. In 1541 he moved with her to Transylvania, but he mostly traveled fulfilling diplomatic services because of his disagreement with cardinal Juraj Utje\u0161inovi\u0107's policy of claiming the Hungarian throne for Isabella's and Z\u00e1polya's infant son (instead of conceding it to Ferdinand I as per Treaty of Nagyv\u00e1rad). Utje\u0161inovi\u0107, appointed by Z\u00e1polya as a guardian of his son, John Sigismund Z\u00e1polya, fought against Ferdinand and allied himself with the Ottoman Empire.\n Passage 2:The famous and influential Swedish filmmaker, Ingmar Bergman, rose to prominence in the fifties. He began making films in the mid-forties, and in 1955, he made Smiles of a Summer Night, which brought him international attention. A year later, he made one of his most famous films, The Seventh Seal. In the 1960s, Bergman won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film for two consecutive years, with The Virgin Spring (Jungfruk\u00e4llan) in 1960 and Through a Glass Darkly (S\u00e5som i en spegel) in 1961. He won the award again in 1983, for the early twentieth-century family drama Fanny and Alexander (Fanny och Alexander). Bergman has also been nominated for the Best Picture award once, with the 1973 Cries and Whispers (Viskningar och rop), the story of two sisters watching over their third sister's deathbed, both afraid she might die, but hoping she does. The film lost to The Sting, and oddly enough, it was not nominated in the Foreign Language Film category. It also gave Bergman the first of three nominations for Best Director. Ingmar Bergman also won four Golden Globe Awards for Best Foreign Language Film.\n Passage 3:Auckland was New Zealand's second capital from 1841 until 1865, when Parliament was permanently moved to Wellington after an argument that was had for one decade. The initial form of government was an executive council formed of public servant appointed by and responsible to the governor. This changed when the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852, an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that granted self-government to the Colony of New Zealand, was received. This allowed for a bicameral General Assembly (or Parliament), consisting of the Governor, an appointed Legislative Council and an elected House of Representatives, with an Executive Council nominally appointed by the Governor. It also allowed for provincial governments, and six provinces were initially established. The first general election was held in 1853.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:Neuser was born in Gunzenhausen and was a popular pastor and theologian in Heidelberg in the 1560s, serving at the Peterskirche and later the Heiliggeistkirche. During the controversy over church discipline that developed in the late 1560s, Neuser became a leading member of the Antidisciplinist, and thus anti-Calvinist, faction led by Thomas Erastus. His disaffection with the ecclesiastical regime perhaps played some role in his doubts concerning orthodox Christian dogma. He wrote letters sternly attacking the doctrine of the trinity. He wrote to the Ottoman Sultan assuring Sultan that he would receive support in Germany if his conquests push him that far. Neuser along with another Antitrinitarian, Johann Sylvan, sought to dialog with the Turks. Neuser was accused of denying divinity to Jesus Christ and was consequently imprisoned. His associate, Johann Sylvan, was tortured and beheaded. Neuser confessed but managed to break out of prison. He later converted to Islam and traveled to Istanbul where he served the Ottoman Sultan.\n Passage 2:He was appointed to hold as fiefs Holstein and Stormarn, including Hamburg, by Lothair, Duke of Saxony, in 1111. By this appointment Adolf became the leader of the defence of Germany against the Wagri. Allied with Henry, the prince of the Obotrites, he repeatedly waged war on Wagria and the Rugians. After Henry's death (1127), Adolf remained allied with his sons Canute and Sventepolk, but they were soon dead and Lothair, by then King of Germany, had made Canute Lavard, a Danish prince, Duke of Schleswig. Feeling his authority threatened by the Danish upstart, Adolf attacked his castle of Albergs, captured the garrison, and destroyed its defences. He left his counties intact to his second son, Adolf II, since his eldest, Hartung, had been killed in the Second Battle of Chlumec in 1126.\n Passage 3:The 1935 Anniversary show commemorated the 2nd anniversary of the Mexican professional wrestling company Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (Spanish for \"Mexican Wrestling Promotion\"; EMLL) holding their first show on September 22, 1933 by promoter and founder Salvador Lutteroth. EMLL was rebranded early in 1992 to become Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (\"World Wrestling Council\"; CMLL) signal their departure from the National Wrestling Alliance. With the sales of the Jim Crockett Promotions to Ted Turner in 1988 EMLL became the oldest, still-operating wrestling promotion in the world. Over the years EMLL/CMLL has on occasion held multiple shows to celebrate their anniversary but since 1977 the company has only held one annual show, which is considered the biggest show of the year, CMLL's equivalent of WWE's WrestleMania or their Super Bowl event. CMLL has held their Anniversary show at Arena M\u00e9xico in Mexico City, Mexico since 1956, the year the building was completed, over time Arena M\u00e9xico earned the nickname \"The Cathedral of Lucha Libre\" due to it hosting most of EMLL/CMLL's major events since the building was completed. EMLL held their first anniversary show at Arena Modelo in 1933 and returned to that building in 1937 through 1943. From 1934 through 1936 EMLL rented Arena Nacional for their shows, but in 1944 they began holding their anniversary shows at Arena Coliseo, an arena they owned.

The Diamondbacks (often shortened as the D-Backs), an American professional baseball team based in Phoenix, Arizona, were formed in 1998, based at Bank One Ballpark. This followed five years of preparation under the leadership of Jerry Colangelo. The Diamondbacks won the World Series championship in 2001, becoming the fastest expansion team in the Major Leagues to win a championship, doing so in only the fourth season since inception in 1998. Financial difficulties were then encountered and the home field was renamed to Chase Field in 2005, as a result of Bank One Corporation's merger with JPMorgan Chase & Co. After a lean period the team won the National League West division in 2011.\n Passage 2:The Bougainville invasion was the ultimate responsibility of Admiral William F. Halsey, commander South Pacific Area, at his headquarters at Noum\u00e9a, New Caledonia. The landings were under the personal direction of Rear Admiral Theodore S.

Loaded aboard eight attack transports (APAs) and four attack cargo transports (AKAs), organized into three transport divisions, were the men of the 3rd Marine Division (reinforced), Major General Allen H. Turnage commanding. The fighting on Bougainville would be the division's first action of the war. With Turnage aboard the was Commodore Lawrence F. Reifsnider, who had responsibility for the transports and attack cargo ships. The transport divisions were escorted by a screen consisting of 11 destroyers, and were supported by various fleet tugs, minesweepers and minelayers. Anti-aircraft guns from the 3rd Marine Defense Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Edward H. Forney and several field artillery batteries from the 12th Marine Regiment under Colonel John B. Wilson were assigned to the operation to provide support to ground troops once ashore. Direct air cover for the landing was provided by Major General Nathan Twining's AirSols command, which included aircraft from: the US Army Air Force (USAAF) the United States Navy the United States Marine Corps and the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF).

Passage 1:Hurricane Dorian was the strongest hurricane to affect the Bahamas on record, causing catastrophic damage in the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama in early September 2019. The fifth tropical cyclone, fourth named storm, second hurricane, and first major hurricane of the annual hurricane season, Dorian originated from a westward traveling tropical wave that was located over a thousand miles east of the Windward Islands on August\u00a023. The disturbance rapidly organized and became a tropical depression and later a tropical storm, both on August\u00a024. The newly formed Dorian struggled to intensify over the next few days due to a combination of dry air and vertical wind shear. The storm passed over Barbados and entered the Caribbean Sea on August\u00a026 as it gradually strengthened. Dorian made landfall in St. Lucia on the next day, which caused serious disruption to the system's structure. Initially predicted to strike Hispaniola, Dorian's track gradually shifted to the east as the storm neared Greater Antilles. Due to land interaction and the dry air, Dorian's center reformed north of its previous location, causing the system's track to shift northward. The storm then turned towards the northwest as it traveled through a weakness in a ridge. A combination of the dry air and shear relaxing as well as the warm sea surface temperatures, allowed Dorian to become a Category\u00a01 hurricane as it passed over St. Thomas on August\u00a028. The storm developed an eye in satellite imagery soon after, but dry air still continued to disrupt the system. The commencement of an eyewall replacement cycle on August\u00a029 temporarily impeded intensification, but Dorian completed the cycle the next morning and soon resumed strengthening.\n Passage 2:Originally a backing band for burlesque shows, in their early years DeVotchKa also toured with burlesque performer and model Dita Von Teese. Numerous nationwide tours in support of self-released records earned the band an underground following. Their song \"How It Ends\" introduced the band to a wider audience after being featured in the trailer for Everything Is Illuminated, in a Gears of War 2 trailer called \"The Last Day\", and in an episode of Everwood (Season 4). Their performance at the 2006 Bonnaroo music festival was considered a breakout event. In between tours, the band was picked by first time film directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris to score Little Miss Sunshine, a 2006 film that would go on to garner four Academy Award nominations. DeVotchKa, along with composer Mychael Danna, composed and performed the majority of the music for the film's soundtrack and were nominated for a 2006 Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack. The main song, \"The Winner Is\", was also used in a commercial by the French-based environment and energy company Suez and the Dutch pension fund PGGM.\n Passage 3:In English, ottava rima first appeared in Elizabethan translations of Tasso and Ariosto. The form also became popular for original works, such as Michael Drayton's The Barons' Wars, Thomas Heywood's Troia Britannica, or Aemilia Lanyer's Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum. William Browne's Britannia's Pastorals also contains passages in ottava rima. The first English poet to write mock-heroic ottava rima was John Hookham Frere, whose 1817-8 poem Prospectus and Specimen of an Intended National Work used the form to considerable effect. Lord Byron read Frere's work and saw the potential of the form. He quickly produced Beppo, his first poem to use the form. Shortly after this, Byron began working on his Don Juan (1819\u20131824), probably the best-known English poem in ottava rima. Byron also used the form for The Vision of Judgment (1822). Shelley translated the Homeric Hymns into English in ottava rima. In the 20th century, William Butler Yeats used the form in several of his best later poems, including \"Sailing to Byzantium\" and \"Among School Children\". So did Kenneth Koch for instance in his autobiographical poem \"Seasons on Earth\" of 1987. In America Emma Lazarus wrote the poem An Epistle that consists of thirty four ottava rimas. Earlier Richard Henry Wilde used the stanza in his long poem Hesperia.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

It subsequently left the peninsula, entering the Atlantic Ocean near Vero Beach early on July 24. As it moved over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream, it quickly organized and intensified into a Category 1 hurricane while east of Jacksonville, Florida. Because it was embedded within the western extension of the subtropical ridge, Bob retained higher-than-average atmospheric pressures throughout its lifespan. The hurricane continued north, and made landfall near Beaufort, South Carolina early on July 25 while maintaining winds of . Bob quickly weakened over land, decaying into a tropical storm three hours after landfall. About 12 hours later, it degenerated into a tropical depression near the North Carolina \u2013 Virginia border. Bob's remnants turned north-northeast, and were absorbed by a frontal trough over eastern West Virginia on July 26. An associated area of disturbed weather remained separate from the trough, and continued northeast through the Mid-Atlantic and New England.\n Passage 2:Mike Phillips attempted to enter an A410 at the 24 Hours of Daytona in 2001, but did not attend the race. The Sports Racing World Cup had been renamed to the FIA Sportscar Championship, but the A410, now driven by Lupberger and Ben Collins, started the season as it had finished 2000; with a retirement, although it did last for 74 laps before blowing its engine with half an hour to go at Barcelona. Next up was the Donington Park of the European Le Mans Series, which saw both A410s entered; although the A410 of Patrick Lemari\u00e9 did not make the start of the race, due to engine problems, Lupberger and Collins were classified 23rd, having retired after 54 minutes \u2013 and 35 laps \u2013 due to another gearbox problem. The 1000 km of Monza, part of the FIA Sportscar Championship, saw the first success for the A410; Collins and Lupberger brought their car home in second, 7 seconds behind the Ferrari 333SP-Judd of Giovanni Lavaggi and Christian Vann. The upturn in form continued at Spa-Francorchamps, where Collins and Lupberger brought the A410 home in fourth, a lap down, but having set the second fastest lap of the race. Lupberger and Collins were partnered by Harri Toivonen for the 24 Hours of Le Mans in the A410-001 chassis, whilst Zwart partnered Xavier Pompidou and Scott Maxwell in the other; neither finished, as the A410-001 retired due to fuel pump issue after 11 hours and 134 laps, and the other car crashed out after 15 hours and 66 laps. Having returned to the FIA Sportscar Championship, Collins and Lupberger took a pair of fourth-place finishes, at Brno and Magny-Cours. The team went even better at Donington Park; Collins and Lupberger won by almost a minute, for the car's maiden victory. The penultimate round of the season, held at Mondello Park, was a little less successful, as the team finished ninth overall, and sixth in the SR1 class. In the final race of the season, held at the N\u00fcrburgring, the car was disqualified from third place due to issues with its dimensions. Team Ascari finished the season in fourth, with 71 points; nine behind Racing for Holland in third, but 30 ahead of R&M in fifth. The team's one European Le Mans Series race resulted in them being classified in eighth, with 11 points.\n Passage 3:Contemporary Paganism, or Neo-Paganism, is a wide variety of modern religious movements influenced by the various pagan beliefs of pre-modern Europe. The religion of Pagan Witchcraft, or Wicca, was developed in England during the first half of the 20th century and is one of several Pagan religions. The figure at the forefront of Wicca's early development was the English occultist Gerald Gardner (1884\u20131964), the author of Witchcraft Today (1954) and The Meaning of Witchcraft (1959) and the founder of a tradition known as Gardnerian Wicca. Gardnerian Wicca revolved around the veneration of both a Horned God and a Mother Goddess, the celebration of eight seasonally-based festivals in a Wheel of the Year and the practice of magical rituals in groups known as covens. Gardnerianism was subsequently brought to the U.S. in the early 1960s by an English initiate, Raymond Buckland (1934\u2013), and his then-wife Rosemary, who together founded a coven in Long Island.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:Following shakedown training near Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, during the summer, Van Voorhis reported at Newport, Rhode Island, for duty with Escort Squadron 14 (CortRon\u00a014). The destroyer escort conducted operations along the east coast of North America until May 1958 when she sailed across the Atlantic for a cruise with the 6th Fleet. While operating with other ships of the 6th Fleet near Crete, she was ordered to the eastern end of the Mediterranean in mid-July to patrol off the Levantine coast. She supported the Marines who landed in Lebanon in response to President Camille Chamoun's request for help during a crisis precipitated by Arab nationalist factions in reaction to his administration's pro-Western policies and its adherence to the Eisenhower Doctrine. President Dwight D. Eisenhower's personal representative Robert D. Murphy helped the factions to negotiate a settlement which resulted in the election of General Fuad Chehab to the presidency on 31 July. President Chamoun's refusal to yield office before the expiration of his term kept the country in turmoil until late September. However, political conditions in Lebanon remained highly volatile, so American forces remained there until after General Chehab took office in September. During this period, Van Voorhis alternated normal 6th Fleet operations with patrols off Lebanon. Late in September, the warship departed the Mediterranean and returned to Newport early in October.\n Passage 2:Steinman provided lyrics for Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Whistle Down the Wind, which opened in Washington, D.C. in December 1996. However, it received poor reviews and the Broadway run, scheduled for the following April, was cancelled. A reworked and more successful West End production opened at the Aldwych Theatre on July 1, 1998. In addition to a full-length cast album for the London production, an album was released of well-known performers singing pop versions of the songs from the show. This album was produced by Steinman, as usual with Steven Rinkoff. Those performers include Tom Jones, Tina Arena, Boyzone, Elaine Paige, Donny Osmond, The Everly Brothers, Meat Loaf, Boy George, Sounds of Blackness, Bonnie Tyler, Michael Ball, and Lottie Mayor. One track, \"No Matter What\" performed by Boyzone, reached the peak position on the pop charts in many countries. The same track appeared on a Boyzone album and their greatest hits album. As of 2019, Boyzone's 1998 recording of \"No Matter What\" is the most recent new song or project written at least in part by Steinman, or to contain any new work of his at all, to achieve major, chart-topping success. The track \"Whistle Down the Wind\", performed by Tina Arena, from the same album, also had some chart success. There was also a single released in the U.K., for charity, of children from Red Hill Primary School and Sylvia Young Theatre School performing \"When Children Rule The World\". The singers were called the \"Red Hill Children\", and the single peaked at #40 on the U.K. singles charts.\n Passage 3:Kenneth Jackson Jr. was raised in Algiers, New Orleans. As a teenager he began rapping at parties on the Westbank alongside Marrero rapper Tim Smooth and Bustdown. He performed at a local block parties before being discovered by Charles \"Big Boy\" Temple in 1992. He was signed the next year to Big Boy Records along with Mystikal, Black Menace and Partners-N-Crime. Jackson dropped k from his name adopting the G and began doing features as G-Slimm. His debut album Fours Deuces & Trays was released on September 3, 1994, and featured, Mystikal who also made his debut on the album. Leroy \"Precise\" Edwards produced the tracks on the album, giving it a West Coast southern feel. The album sold well over 200,000 copies the first month, becoming the most acclaimed local rap albums of 1994. Due to the identical track layout format, it was often compared with Dr. Dre.'s The Chronic album. It was the first album produced in New Orleans to have a California G-Funk sound, relevant to G-Funk area of the mid 90s. The following year Jackson was offered a deal by Relativity Records. While working on his sophomore album titled G-Slimm for Relativity, he was murdered before it hit the stores. His last feature was with close friend rapper Tim Smooth on his album \"Da Franchise.\" Da Franchise was released in 1998 two years after his death.

After concluding this alliance, the Chionites (probably of the Kidarites tribe) under their King Grumbates accompanied Shapur II in the war against the Romans, especially at the Siege of Amida in 359 CE. Victories of the Xionites during their campaigns in the Eastern Caspian lands were also witnesses and described by Ammianus Marcellinus.\n Passage 2:Thanjavur was successfully conquered in 1674 by Ekoji I (1675\u201384), the Maratha feudatory of the sultan of Bijapur and half-brother of Shivaji (1627/30-80) of the Bhonsle dynasty. Ekoji founded the Thanjavur Maratha kingdom which ruled Thanjavur till 1855. The Marathas exercised their sovereignty over Thanjavur throughout the last quarter of the 17th and the whole of the 18th century. The Maratha rulers patronized Carnatic music. In 1787, Amar Singh, the regent of Thanjavur, deposed the minor Raja, his nephew Serfoji II (1787\u201393) and captured the throne. Serfoji II was restored in 1799 with the assistance of the British, who induced him to relinquish the administration of the kingdom and left him in charge of Thanjavur fort and surrounding areas. The kingdom was eventually absorbed into British India in 1855 by the Doctrine of Lapse when Shivaji II (1832\u201355), the last Thanjavur Maratha ruler, died without a legitimate male heir. The British referred to the city as Tanjore in their records. Five years after its annexation, the British replaced Negapatam (modern-day Nagapattinam) with Thanjavur as the seat of the district administration. Under the British, Thanjavur emerged as an important regional centre. The 1871 India census recorded a population of 52,171, making Thanjavur the third largest city in the Madras Presidency. After India's independence, Thanjavur continued as the district headquarters.\n Passage 3:Rodrigo studied music under Francisco Antich in Valencia and under Paul Dukas at the \u00c9cole Normale de Musique in Paris.

In 1943 he received Spain's National Prize for Orchestra for Cinco piezas infantiles (\"Five Children's Pieces\"), based on his earlier composition of the same piece for two pianos, premiered by Ricardo Vi\u00f1es. From 1947 Rodrigo was a professor of music history, holding the Manuel de Falla Chair of Music in the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters, at Complutense University of Madrid.

Passage 1:The Dublin Grand Opera Society (DGOS) was founded in 1941 by Captain (later Colonel) William O'Kelly and a group of opera enthusiasts with John McCormack as its patron. The shows were cast with local singers and a volunteer chorus. Initially the music was provided by the orchestra of the Irish Army music school, and later by the Radio Eireann Symphony Orchestra. The Society put on two one-week seasons of opera throughout the years of World War II. After the war ended the DGOS presented performances by European opera companies such as the Opera-Comique, Hamburg Opera and the Netherlands Opera. From the mid 1950s to 1966, the Society, concentrated on Italian opera with the help of sponsorship from the Italian government. During that time numerous Italian stars and rising stars of the day appeared there, including Luciano Pavarotti who sang in Rigoletto, La traviata, and La boh\u00e8me. The Italian sponsorship ended in 1966, but the Arts Council of Ireland and the Bord F\u00e1ilte (Ireland's tourist board) continued to provide guarantees for any financial losses. New opera companies were brought in, including the Romanian National Opera and the Prague National Theatre. \n Passage 2:The music for the film is scored by A R Rahman replacing Imtiaz Ali's previous associate, Pritam. Mohit Chauhan has lent his voice for nine songs and he is voice of character Jordan (played by Ranbir Kapoor). In 2010, during the development of the album, Rahman stated, \"Rockstar is a character driven film and as one can guess from the title, there will be lots of guitar\". In 2010, several meetings of Ali and the lyricist brought into a phrase titled, \"Words destroy what I have to say\". The song (Jo Bhi Main) that brings out the dilemma of the protagonist. Kamil suggested the last two lines (In lafzon ke maayne jaaney kaun badalta hai, main kehta hoon kuch, aur matlab aur koi ho jaata hai) for the particular song. But Ali didn't accept the lines because the protagonist wasn't supposed to have this level of sophistication as he was not poetic. To make it sound like something that could come from character Jordan, Kamil toned down the original after a few more rounds of discussion the lines were \"Jo Bhi Main Kehna Chaahoon Barbaad Kare Alfaaz Mere\" in the soundtrack. Upon development of the vociferating words Sadda Haq, Kamil stated that the situation needed a politically charged number that Jordan performs before a surging crowd at the height of his artistic angst. The slogan was used by students during Kamil's college days in Punjab to protest against the administration's arbitrary announcement of exams. On writing lyrics of \"Phir Se Udd Chala\", the analogies, he stated on introduction of offtrack lines like \"Banu Raavan, Jiyoon Mar Marke\" (\"I become Raavan by continuing to live each time I die\"), \"The line was a metaphor for character Jordan who like the demon Ravan from the mythology Ramayana, dies a number of times and yet goes on with his life and that is why I used the Ravan simile.\" As per Rahman two songs Jo Bhi Mein and Sadda Haq aspire to be in the tradition of song Satisfaction by The Rolling Stones and song Another Brick in the Wall by Pink Floyd. Further, he added, \"Just like most rock songs stood for people's voices, here also the central character's cry relates to every one of us.\" In an interview with Mid-Day, he stated, \"I consciously kept away from using distorted guitars and heavy snazzy music. But I have done it here in Rockstar. Plus most songs are acoustic.\" For the song Katiya Karun singer Harshdeep Kaur noted that the song was recorded at AR Studios, Powai, Mumbai. Rahman asked the translation of Katiya Karun lyrics to which she explained the meaning to him. The lyrics translate as, \"I spin your cotton all night, the entire day is spent in this thought, I shall live and die for you, Be a spinning wheel O\u2019 my body.\" Rahman wanted it to be a very catchy number as it was going to be a fun song with Jordan and Heer (played by Nargis Fakhri) on the road. Rahman started composing and created the song right in front of the singer. Kaur stated that it wasn't a folk song, only the rhyme Katiya Karun belongs to a Punjabi folk content. A part of the song was shot at a discotheque and hence, Kamil put in subtle metaphor lyrics in the song lines translating, \"I will spin your cotton all night long\" that indirectly implied \"I will be at your services all night\", thus giving it an item song touch.\n Passage 3:In Europe, the espousal of atheistic views was rare during the Early Middle Ages and Middle Ages (see Medieval Inquisition); metaphysics and theology were the dominant interests pertaining to religion. There were, however, movements within this period that furthered heterodox conceptions of the Christian god, including differing views of the nature, transcendence, and knowability of God. Individuals and groups such as Johannes Scotus Eriugena, David of Dinant, Amalric of Bena, and the Brethren of the Free Spirit maintained Christian viewpoints with pantheistic tendencies. Nicholas of Cusa held to a form of fideism he called docta ignorantia (\"learned ignorance\"), asserting that God is beyond human categorization, and thus our knowledge of him is limited to conjecture. William of Ockham inspired anti-metaphysical tendencies with his nominalistic limitation of human knowledge to singular objects, and asserted that the divine essence could not be intuitively or rationally apprehended by human intellect. Followers of Ockham, such as John of Mirecourt and Nicholas of Autrecourt furthered this view. The resulting division between faith and reason influenced later radical and reformist theologians such as John Wycliffe, Jan Hus, and Martin Luther.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

The first and foremost political division of the Isabeline era was between Carlists and Cristinos (or Isabelinos), the former being supporters of Infante Carlos, Count of Molina, a rival claimant to the throne and the latter being supporters of Maria Christina and Isabella. The former supported absolute monarchism and the traditionalism of the Antiguo R\u00e9gimen (\"Old Regime\"); they were uniformly close to the Roman Catholic Church, and generally clericalist. The latter were generally supporters of constitutional monarchy (although some, including Maria Christina herself, were more inclined toward enlightened absolutism); they were liberals of one stripe or another, ranging from liberal conservatives and those whose liberalism was strictly economic to social liberals. In the 1830s, these two groups faced off in the First Carlist War, which the Cristinos won. The terms of surrender\u2014notably the Convention of Vergara\u2014left an opportunity for relatively moderate Carlists to continue to play a role in the country's politics, and many did so over the ensuing decades.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

One of those players was Steve Owens. After an impressive year in 1969, despite Oklahoma's 6\u20134 record, Owens was named the Sooners' second Heisman Trophy winner. It did not take long for Fairbanks to return the team to form. He and his offensive co-ordinator Barry Switzer helped implement the use of the wishbone offense. Fairbanks' 1970 team tied Bear Bryant's Alabama Crimson Tide in the Bluebonnet Bowl to finish the season ranked #20. They began the 1971 season ranked number ten. In consecutive weeks, they beat #17 USC, #3 Texas and #6 Colorado. These early-season wins propelled them to a #2 national ranking and set the stage for one of the great college football games of the century against top-ranked Nebraska. Led by quarterback Jack Mildren and running back Greg Pruitt, Oklahoma was a scoring machine, averaging 44.5\u00a0points per game, the second highest in team history. The offense set the all-time NCAA single-season rushing record at 472.4 yards per game, a record which still stands to this day. Equally impressive that season was Pruitt's nine yards per carry, and Mildren is often referred to as \"the Godfather of the wishbone\" by University of Oklahoma football fans. On November 25, 1971, Nebraska edged Oklahoma, 35\u201331 in the Game of the Century what was to be the only loss of the season for Oklahoma. Oklahoma went on to beat Oklahoma State and fifth ranked Auburn to finish the season ranked number two. Fairbanks closed out his career at Oklahoma the following year with a win in the Sugar Bowl over Penn State after having lost once all season, to Colorado.

During his two years as Superintendent, Chandler proves to be one of the most corrupt bosses the station has ever had. He removes various members of the team he personally dislikes, including Sergeant Bob Cryer and PC Dale Smith. One of the people that Chandler cannot remove is the officer just beneath him in the chain of command \u2013 DCI Jack Meadows. Meadows, as DS Don Beech's boss, is directly in the firing line along with DI Chris Deakin and Chief Superintendent Brownlow. However unlike the other two men, Meadows survives, thanks to his connections with Scotland Yard. Chandler immediately clashed with DC Mickey Webb, who held Chandler responsible that a friend during an undercover operation was killed by the ring-leader. Later, Mickey attended a community meeting with Chief Inspector Derek Conway, who Chandler asked to go, claiming he was a community meeting, when he was actually sleeping with Webb's best friend, Kate Spears. At the end of a seemingly successful meeting, a bike pulled up and the pillion passenger threw a petrol bomb into Conway's car, which subsequently exploded, killing him. Chandler then asked the relief to stand down before a Neo-Nazi march, but unrest settled and rioters lobbed petrol bombs at Sun Hill, and a fire broke out causing an explosion, however the real bomber was PC Des Taviner, who wanted to dispose of evidence money in Conway's fund. Six officers were killed, including Spears, so Webb teamed up with Meadows to bring down Chandler. DS Debbie McAllister then got close to Chandler, and they got intimate in a bathroom during the funerals, and she later became pregnant. Webb was briefly transferred to neighbouring Barton Street, but when an old Hendon girlfriend, Anne Merrick, claimed Chandler raped her, Meadows used this to get Webb back. However, events changed when Merrick was found dead below a multi-storey, however Chandler was alibied and it was ruled suicide, due to her manic-depressive state, but it wasn't in vain. Thanks to James Chandler, the Super's brother, and two Hendon friends, DAC Gordon Cooper & Sergeant Dave Gilbert, plus word from Merrick, Chandler was caught up in a rape scandal.

The absence of competition permitted first, the Asdingi Vandals, and later, the Suebi, to expand south and east. After the departure of the Vandals for Africa in 429 Roman authority in the peninsula was reasserted for 10 years except in northwest where the Suevi were confined. In its heyday Suebic Gallaecia extended as far south as M\u00e9rida and Seville, capitals of the Roman provinces of Lusitania and Betica, while their expeditions reached Zaragoza and Lleida after taking the Roman capital, Merida in 439. The previous year 438 Hermeric ratified the peace with the Gallaeci, the local and partially romanized rural population, and, weary of fighting, abdicated in favour of his son Rechila, who proved to be a notable general, defeating first Andevotus, Romanae militiae dux, and later Vitus magister utriusque militiae. In 448, Rechila died, leaving the crown to his son Rechiar who had converted to Roman Catholicism circa 447. Soon, he married a daughter of the Gothic king Theodoric I, and began a wave of attacks on the Tarraconense, still a Roman province. By 456 the campaigns of Rechiar clashed with the interests of the Visigoths, and a large army of Roman federates (Visigoths under the command of Theodoric II, Burgundians directed by kings Gundioc and Chilperic) crossed the Pyrenees into Hispania, and defeated the Suebi near modern-day Astorga. Rechiar was executed after being captured by his brother-in-law, the Visigothic king Theodoric II. In 459, the Roman Emperor Majorian defeated the Suebi, briefly restoring Roman rule in northern Hispania. Nevertheless, the Suebi became free of Roman control forever after Majorian was assassinated two years later. The Suebic kingdom was confined in the northwest in Gallaecia and northern Lusitania where political division and civil war arose among several pretenders to the royal throne. After years of turmoil, Remismund was recognized as the sole king of the Suebi, bringing forth a politic of friendship with the Visigoths, and favoring the conversion of his people to Arianism.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:Despite its initial success, Epcot constantly met the challenges of evolving with worldwide progress, an issue that caused the park to lose relevance and become outdated in the 1990s. To maintain attendance levels, Disney introduced seasonal events such as the International Flower & Garden Festival and the International Food & Wine Festival in 1994 and 1995, respectively. In the mid-1990s, Disney also began to gradually phase out the park's edutainment attractions in favor of more modern and thrilling attractions. As a result, many of the attractions within the Future World pavilions, were either rehauled or replaced entirely. Universe of Energy was reconfigured as Ellen's Energy Adventure in 1996, World of Motion was rethemed as Test Track, and Horizons was demolished in 1999 and replaced with . Walt Disney World held the Millenium Celebration with the central focus of the event at Epcot. The Living Seas was closed in 2005, and rethemed with the introduction of characters from Finding Nemo, as The Seas with Nemo and Friends. That same year, the Soarin' attraction was added to The Land. Wonders of Life closed in 2007, with the pavilon being occasionally used for the park's annual festivals.\n Passage 2:As a boy, Roebuck worked as a trammer and after being sentenced to one month's imprisonment for stealing a watch in 1904, he enlisted in the York and Lancaster Regiment. Over the next seven years, he was stationed in India and Ireland and was promoted to lance corporal, but was demoted back to private in 1910 for \"misconduct\". He married in 1908 and had two children. Roebuck was discharged into the reserves in 1912 and likely returned to work as a miner prior to becoming a professional footballer in 1913. After Britain's entry into the First World War in August 1914, he was called up by the York and Lancaster Regiment and arrived on the Western Front in September 1914. On 18 October 1914, Roebuck recorded as \"presumed dead\" after an attack near Beaucamps-Ligny during the Race to the Sea. His death was confirmed by two comrades in January 1915. Roebuck is commemorated on the Ploegsteert Memorial to the Missing.\n Passage 3:In December, Jax started a feud with Sasha Banks, whom she injured as part of the storyline.

The duke went to the forest in but could not find them. He then ordered his men to set fire to the forest in order to force Jie out. When Jie and his mother were killed instead, the duke was overcome with remorse and erected a temple in his honor. The people of Shanxi subsequently revered Jie as an immortal and avoided lighting fires for as long as a month in the depths of winter, a practice so injurious to children and the elderly that the area's rulers unsuccessfully attempted to ban it for centuries.

Passage 1:On February 25, 1956, Khrushchev gave a clandestine speech to the Twentieth Party Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which was entitled, \"On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences\", which denounced Stalin and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. Khrushchev charged Stalin with fostering a personality cult, despite maintaining support for the ideals of communism. The speech was highly critical of Stalin and his reign of terror, primarily denouncing the purges of the Soviet military and Communist Party, which had taken place during the latter part of the 1930s. The speech brought forth several accusations, notably those concerning the Moscow Trials, where rulings were made, based on forced confessions, which were obtained through torture. Judicial decisions were determined, based on liberal interpretations of Article 58 of the Russian SFSR Penal Code, which was introduced in 1927, in order to arrest individuals suspected of counter-revolutionary activities. Due process, in accordance with Soviet law, was often dismissed and replaced with summary proceedings issued by institutional commissions known as NKVD troikas, who issued sentences to the accused without representation, defense, or trial.\n Passage 2:Pallikaranai wetland is a freshwater marsh in the city of Chennai, India. It is situated adjacent to the Bay of Bengal, about south of the city centre, and has a geographical area of . Pallikaranai marshland is the only surviving wetland ecosystem of the city and is among the few and last remaining natural wetlands of South India. It is one of the 94 identified wetlands under National Wetland Conservation and Management Programme (NWCMP) operationalised by the Government of India in 1985\u201386 and one of the three in the state of Tamil Nadu, the other two being Point Calimere and Kazhuveli. It is also one of the prioritised wetlands of Tamil Nadu. The topography of the swamp is such that it always retains some storage, thus forming an aquatic ecosystem. A project on 'Inland Wetlands of India' commissioned by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India had prioritised Pallikaranai marsh as one of the most significant wetlands of the country. The marsh contains several rare or endangered and threatened species and acts as a forage and breeding ground for thousands of migratory birds from various places within and outside the country. The number of bird species sighted in the wetland is significantly higher than the number at Vedanthangal Bird Sanctuary.\n Passage 3:The previous season was one of the worst for LSU under Les Miles, matching the record of the 2008 LSU Tigers football team. The team did manage to sign the consensus #2 recruiting class in the country, including top rated recruits Leonard Fournette, Malachi Dupre, and Brandon Harris, all who made contributions during the season. After the bowl game, Defensive Coordinator John Chavis announced he was leaving LSU for the same position at Texas A&M. LSU hired former Alabama defensive coordinator Kevin Steele to fill the position, and subsequently hired former Ole Miss head coach Ed Orgeron to coach the defensive line.

Roy Keane said \"I'm delighted with the overall performance. It would have been nice to test their goalkeeper a bit more but overall I'm delighted with the players' efforts.\" about the team's display. Jack Pelter signed for Sunderland on 8 September, from New Zealand team Canterbury United, on a free transfer in an original one-month deal. Two weeks after the defeat to Manchester United, Sunderland beat Reading 2\u20131 on 15 September. Kenwyne Jones and Ross Wallace scored the Sunderland goals in a game which was overshadowed by the tribute paid to 1973 FA Cup Final scorer Ian Porterfield who died on 11 September 2007. Sunderland met Middlesbrough on 22 September in their first north east derby of the season. Grant Leadbitter scored in the 2nd minute to put Sunderland in front, but two ex-Sunderland players; Julio Arca and Stewart Downing put Middlesbrough into the lead. Liam Miller scored an 89th minute volley to save a point for Sunderland.

Decareau's wife, Rosa, commented that a lot of work on the microwave oven was done at their home. Then at Lipton, he was involved in freeze drying. In the 1960s, Decareau moved to Palo Alto, California to work with Litton Industries. While at Litton, he developed microwave ovens that would be the foundation of commercial versions. Decareau moved back to Natick, Massachusetts later in his career to work in research and development at the United States Army Soldier Systems Center to develop food processing techniques for military and space exploration applications. His work would earn him Fellowship of the Institute of Food Technologists in 1994.

Passage 1:In 1689 the Gothic edifice was demolished as it proved too small for the growing cult of Saint John Cantius, the patron saint of the Jagiellonian University who's laid to rest there. In 1689-1705 the new Baroque church was erected, modelled on Sant'Andrea della Valle in Rome. The architect was a Polonized Dutchman Tylman van Gameren, a chief architect at the court of John III Sobieski. The interior stucco decoration is the work of Baldassarre Fontana, and the polychromy assisted by painters and brothers Carlo and Innocente Monti and Karl Dankwart of Nysa. The painting of St. Anne in the high altar is the work of Jerzy Siemiginowski-Eleuter, court painter of King John III Sobieski. The 18th-century paintings in the stalls showing the life of Saint Anne are by Szymon Czechowicz. In the transept there is an altar of the adoration of the cross to the left, and the tomb of John Cantius to the right.\n Passage 2:The military history of the Aleutian Islands began almost immediately following the purchase of Alaska from the Russian Empire by the United States in 1867. Prior to the early 20th century, the Aleutian Islands were essentially ignored by the United States Armed Forces, although the islands played a small role in the Bering Sea Arbitration when a number of British and American vessels were stationed at Unalaska to enforce the arbitrators' decision. By the early 20th century, a number of war strategies examined the possibility of conflict breaking out between the Empire of Japan and the United States. While the Aleutian Islands were seen as a potential staging point for invasions by either side, this possibility was dismissed owing to the islands' dismal climate. In 1922, the Washington Naval Treaty was signed, after which the United States Navy began to take an interest in the islands. However, nothing of significance was to materialize until World War II.\n Passage 3:On 15 February 2016, McCartney announced two initial festival dates in Europe for the upcoming summer. These two headlining performances at Pinkpop Festival in Landgraaf, Netherlands and Rock Werchter in Werchter, Belgium were revealed before the initial revelation of the \"One on One\" tour. These tours would feature mostly similar elements of the \"One on One\" performances yet with a condensed set list to allot for festival curfew limits and less stage elements given restrictions. In the wake of the passing of notable Beatles and McCartney producer George Martin, McCartney announced the initial \"One on One\" dates for North America and Europe. In North America, McCartney's visit to Fresno, California would mark his first performance in the city, and his performances in North Little Rock and Sioux Falls would be his first performances in the states of Arkansas and South Dakota respectively. Elsewhere in North America, McCartney would perform in Portland after an eleven-year absence following his 2005 'US' tour. The two shows in Vancouver would follow his previous performance in the city at the BC Place stadium in 2012, yet this tour would feature two shows in the neighboring Rogers Arena after the pyrotechnics during his concert at BC Place accidentally damaged the stadium's new roof. McCartney's Seattle show would mark his shortest absence from any North American city on the tour announced currently, as he performed at the city's Safeco Field during the inaugural year of the 'Out There' tour. McCartney announced a performance on 16 March in Minneapolis at the Target Center. This show would take place on 4 May 2016, less than two years after McCartney's last performance in the city at the adjacent baseball stadium sharing a corporate sponsor with the arena, Target Field. Due to high demand of tickets a second show in Minneapolis was announced the next day and would take place on 5 May.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Before they retire, they wanted to release a bonus track album from leftovers from seventies and eighties just for the fans. After playing the final show in Munich in December, 2012, band planned to take a break and go on vacation. In January, 2013, MTV contacted the band and asked if they are interested in doing the MTV Unplugged album. They agreed on doing that project and turned out to be successful. That whole thing pushed back the bonus track project. As soon as they have finished the MTV Unplugged project, band immediately went back to studio to work on bonus track project. Band was listening the recordings they have already prepared for the project. They were happy with the result and Rudolf Schenker said that he has a tape with some songs that they could also use for this project. While searching for the tape, Schenker found an old ledger in which his mother enumerated the loans that his father provided to him, so he could buy all the equipment and establish the band. He looked into the book and it said: \"September, 1965\". He went back to the studio and told the band what he found and their manager said that it would be great idea to celebrate 50th Anniversary since they are the only German band who is 50 years in music and one of the few in the world along with The Rolling Stones, The Who, Beach Boys and Pink Floyd. Manager suggested to the band that they contact the promoters and see if they are interested in band doing the 50th Anniversary Tour. Then Schenker suggested that if band is going to do a 50th Anniversary Tour, then band needs to release brand new studio album. So the band went again into the listening process of bonus track material that they have already prepare and see if they can improve something, like choruses and riffs. After that, they re-recorded the old stuff and started to write new songs with the producers Mikael Nord Andersson and Martin Hansen. The result was the album Return to Forever.\n Passage 2:The northern segment of the fault runs from Hollister, through the Santa Cruz Mountains, epicenter of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, then up the San Francisco Peninsula, where it was first identified by Professor Lawson in 1895, then offshore at Daly City near Mussel Rock. This is the approximate location of the epicenter of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The fault returns onshore at Bolinas Lagoon just north of Stinson Beach in Marin County. It returns underwater through the linear trough of Tomales Bay which separates the Point Reyes Peninsula from the mainland, runs just east of Bodega Head through Bodega Bay and back underwater, returning onshore at Fort Ross. (In this region around the San Francisco Bay Area several significant \"sister faults\" run more-or-less parallel, and each of these can create significantly destructive earthquakes.) From Fort Ross, the northern segment continues overland, forming in part a linear valley through which the Gualala River flows. It goes back offshore at Point Arena. After that, it runs underwater along the coast until it nears Cape Mendocino, where it begins to bend to the west, terminating at the Mendocino Triple Junction.\n Passage 3:The first archaeological investigation of the site was carried out in 1964. In that year, the site was noted during an archaeological survey of the region directed by Maurits N. van Loon of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, and a small sounding was made. In 1965, a more extensive excavation was carried out, again under the direction of Van Loon. Between 1971 and 1974, work on the site was resumed by a team of the French Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) directed by Jacques Cauvin. All excavations were part of the larger international \u2013 and eventually UNESCO-coordinated \u2013 effort to investigate as many archaeological sites as possible in the area that would be flooded by Lake Assad, the reservoir of the Tabqa Dam, which was being built at that time. The filling of Lake Assad eventually led to the flooding of Mureybet in 1976. Although the site is now submerged and no longer accessible, the material that has been retrieved during the excavations continues to generate new research. This material is currently stored at the National Museum of Aleppo and the Institute de Pr\u00e9histoire Orientale in Jal\u00e8s-Berrias in France.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

The division, under command of XII Corps, became part of the British Second Army, which was engaged in the Battle for Caen. With the arrival of the 59th Division General Bernard Montgomery, commanding the Anglo-Canadian 21st Army Group, decided to renew the offensive to capture the city of Caen, which was originally a D-Day objective for the British 3rd Infantry Division which ultimately failed, due mainly to heavier resistance than expected.

In May, he went to the United States to replace his brother James as \"fiscal agent\" raising D\u00e1il funds for the Irish Republic. He was re-elected mayor in January 1922, and opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The fact that D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann funds in the US were in O'Mara's name as trustee caused legal difficulties for the pro-Treaty administration.\n Passage 2:The 2011 season was the West Coast Eagles' 25th season in the premier Australian rules football competition, the Australian Football League (AFL). The previous season, West Coast had finished 16th and last overall to receive their first wooden spoon. The club began the season by reaching the semi-finals of the league's pre-season knock-out competition, the NAB Cup. They began their season with a four-point win over on Sunday, 27 March.

She created translations of plays that were enabled not only be her fluency in French but with her knowledge of theatre after reading so many plays as a literary agent. Her translations included Crime Passionel by Jean Paul Sartre. She also translated his play \"Morts sans S\u00e9pulture\" and was thrilled when the director said that it was perfect. In partnership with Michael Flanders, she translated Stravinsky's Histoire du soldat for the Edinburgh Festival.

In the episode of Doctor Who Confidential accompanying the episode \"Utopia\" (2007), where the same effect is used for the Master's regeneration, it is stated that the production team decided that this would be a common effect for all future Time Lord regenerations, rather than each regeneration being designed uniquely at the whim of the individual director. This style of transition is seen again in \"The Stolen Earth\"/\"Journey's End\" (2008) both when the Doctor undergoes an aborted regeneration, and when his hand spawns a clone in the second part; in The End of Time (2010) during which Matt Smith took over the role as the Eleventh Doctor; in \"The Impossible Astronaut\" when the Doctor is shot twice and seemingly killed; in \"Day of the Moon\" when a young girl regenerates; and in \"Let's Kill Hitler\" when Mels (Nina Toussaint-White) is shot and regenerates into River Song (Alex Kingston). \"The Night of the Doctor\" and \"The Day of the Doctor\" subsequently use the effect to show the Eighth Doctor and War Doctor's regenerations respectively. The Eighth Doctor's regeneration into the War Doctor uses steady beams of light as opposed to the flame effect used for other revived series regenerations. In the Series 10 episode \"The Lie of the Land\", the Twelfth Doctor fakes a regeneration as part of a plan to test if Bill still has free will. The effect used is consistent with the one used in the modern series, with the Doctor's hands glowing and emitting regeneration energy before he enters full regeneration. However, as the regeneration was not real, it did not use up a regeneration and the Doctor did not change bodies.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

He has had spells of study at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, in 1990 and 2000, and has also again taught in Paris, at the \u00c9cole pratique des hautes \u00e9tudes (Ve section) and in the \u00c9cole des hautes \u00e9tudes en sciences sociales.\n Passage 2:Sweden ( ), officially the Kingdom of Sweden ( ), is a country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and north and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the \u00d6resund Strait. At , Sweden is the largest country in Northern Europe, the third-largest country in the European Union and the fifth largest country in Europe by area. The capital city is Stockholm. Sweden has a total population of 10.3\u00a0million of which 2.5 million have a foreign background. Persons who have foreign backgrounds are defined as persons who are foreign born, or born in Sweden with foreign born parents. It has a low population density of and the highest urban concentration is in the central and southern half of the country.\n Passage 3:The interior of French Guiana was virtually unknown and Crevaux decided to lead an exploration into its depths. On July 8, 1877 Crevaux traveled up the Maroni River where he encountered the Galibi and the Bonis. He left the Maroni to follow a tributary, the Itany River, along the way he visited the Roucouyenne and then followed an Emerillon trail over the spine of the Tumuk Humak Mountains. He descended the other side of the mountains to the Jari River, a tributary of the Amazon. By December 1877 he had reached the Brazilian city of Bel\u00e9m. He was nearly naked and had lost or used most of his possessions, and was believed by the Brazilian inhabitants to be an escaped French prisoner and was refused any help. He was eventually aided by a fellow Frenchman who bought him passage on a ship back to France. Upon returning to France, Crevaux gave an account of his journey to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de G\u00e9ographie and was made a \"Knight\" of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

He made his Premier Academy League debut in a 3\u20132 defeat to Watford on 8 April 2006, at the age of 16. He became a regular for the Academy in the 2006\u201307 season, appearing 26 times and scoring 9 goals as West Ham finished as runners-up to Arsenal. He carried his goalscoring form into the 2007\u201308 season, scoring 10 goals in 24 appearances. He made his Premier Reserve League debut on 29 August 2007, in a 2\u20131 defeat to Aston Villa. His first goals came in the 8\u20130 rout over Derby County, as he netted a brace. He was part of the first-team squad that travelled to North America in the summer of 2008 for the pre-season tour. He started the 2008\u201309 season in the reserves, scoring his first goal of the season on 21 October 2008, in a 1\u20130 home win over Arsenal.\n Passage 2:The following year a Combined Leeward and Windward Islands team played a first-class match against Guyana in the 1976/77 Shell Shield. In 1978, the ground held its first List A match when the Leeward Islands played Trinidad and Tobago in the 1977/78 Geddes Grant/Harrison Line Trophy. Throughout the 1970s, the ground was continuously used by Montserrat in its minor matches against regional neighbours. A second List A match was played there in 1980, between the Leeward Islands and Trinidad and Tobago in the 1979/80 Geddes Grant/Harrison Line Trophy, while the following year a further first-class match was played there when the Leeward Islands played a touring England XI. The next first-class fixture there came two years later, when the Leeward Islands played Jamaica in the 1982/83 Shell Shield. Two further List A matches were played there in the 1980s, the first seeing the Leeward Islands play Guyana in the 1984/85 Geddes Grant/Harrison Line Trophy, while the second saw them play the Windward Islands in the 1987/88 competition. Again in use by Montserrat throughout the 1980s, first-class cricket would not return there until 1994, when the Leeward Islands played Trinidad and Tobago in the 1993/94 Red Stripe Cup. The previous year, it had held a List A match between the Leeward Islands and Barbados in the 1992/93 Geddes Grant Shield. Unknowingly at the time, these would be the last major matches to be played there.\n Passage 3:Heutz joined Imperial College London in 2007 as a Royal Society Dorothy Hodgkin Research Fellow. She was awarded the 2008 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining Silver Medal for her research on organic thin films. In particular she had developed new electron - donor morphologies for efficient solar cells. Heutz specialises in the use of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) to monitor unpaired electrons within materials. She used EPR to monitor spins within copper phthalocyanine solar cells. Whilst working on new materials for photovoltaics, Heutz showed that electrons in copper phthalocyanine (a blue pigment found in a Bank of England \u00a35 note) exist in a superposition of two different spin states. She demonstrated that copper phthalocyanine could be used for quantum computing, where information is stored as qubits as opposed to binary bits.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:The New Orleans Saints are a professional American football team based in New Orleans, Louisiana. They are a member of the South Division of the National Football Conference (NFC) in the National Football League (NFL). The NFL awarded the city of New Orleans the 16th franchise in the league in November 1, 1966, All Saints Day, five months after the 89th United States Congress approved the merger of the NFL with the American Football League (AFL) in June of that year. In January 1967, the team was given the current \"New Orleans Saints\" name, and began playing in their first season in September of that year. Since the franchise's creation, it has been based in New Orleans. The team's home games were originally played at Tulane Stadium from 1967 to 1974, it was demolished in 1979, when the team relocated its home games to its current stadium, the Mercedes-Benz Superdome (formerly Louisiana Superdome from 1975 to 2011).\n Passage 2:The first five stages took place in and around Andalusia in southern Spain; the 2014 Vuelta had also started there. The first stage was a team time trial along the coast from Puerto Ban\u00fas to Marbella. The next four stages were fairly flat, although Stage 2 finished on a moderately difficult climb. The sixth stage started in C\u00f3rdoba and finished in Sierra de Cazorla in Ja\u00e9n on another moderately difficult climb. The seventh stage then returned to Andalusia for the first major difficulty of the race: the first-category summit finish at La Alpujarra. The route then continued along the eastern coast of Spain, with a medium-mountain seventh stage and another first-category summit finish at Benitachell on Stage 9. There was one more medium-mountain stage on Stage 10, taking the riders into the Province of Castell\u00f3n. This was followed by a transfer that took the riders into Andorra for a three-day spell, beginning with the first rest day. The eleventh stage took place entirely in Andorra; though it was only in length, it included six categorised climbs, including a summit finish, and was described by Eusebio Unzu\u00e9 (the manager of the Movistar team) as \"the toughest Vuelta stage that he has seen in more than 30 years\". Stage 12 took the riders back into Spain for a fairly flat stage, before three consecutive stages with summit finishes. These took place in the mountains of Cantabria and Asturias and were followed by the race's second rest day. The final week of the race included no summit finishes: the first stage was a individual time trial in Burgos and was then followed by three mixed stages that took the riders nearer to the final stage of the race, a sprint stage in Madrid. For the first time, the race organisers also held a women's race on the same day as the final stage, using the same circuit. This race \u2013 called La Madrid Challenge by La Vuelta \u2013 was won by Shelley Olds.\n Passage 3:During the Second World War Hakewill-Smith initially served as Commanding Officer (CO) of the 5th Battalion, Devonshire Regiment, for several months from May 1940 and from September that year, as the CO of the 4th/5th Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers, as an acting lieutenant colonel. He was promoted to temporary brigadier on 30 March 1941, and commanded the 157th Infantry Brigade until late March 1942. He then became Director of Organization at the War Office before assuming command of the 155th Infantry Brigade in mid-February 1943. On 26 December 1943, promoted to temporary major general, he assumed command of the mountain warfare-trained 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division from Major-General Neil Ritchie as its General Officer Commanding (GOC).

Passage 1:The Sunday Times is a British national broadsheet newspaper, the Sunday sister paper of The Times. In 1968, under the ownership of Lord Thomson, The Sunday Times had been involved in a deal to purchase the Mussolini diaries for an agreed final purchase price of \u00a3250,000, although they had only paid out an initial amount of \u00a360,000. These turned out to be forgeries undertaken by an Italian mother and daughter, Amalia and Rosa Panvini. In 1981 Rupert Murdoch, who owned several other papers in Australia, New Zealand and the UK, purchased Times Newspapers Ltd, which owned both The Times and its Sunday sister. Murdoch appointed Frank Giles to be the editor of The Sunday Times. The historian Hugh Trevor-Roper became an independent national director of The Times in 1974. Trevor-Roper\u2014who was created Baron Dacre of Glanton in 1979\u2014was a specialist on Nazi Germany, who had worked for the British Intelligence Services during and after the Second World War. At the war's end he had undertaken an official investigation of Hitler's death, interviewing eyewitnesses to the F\u00fchrer's last movements. In addition to the official report he filed, Trevor-Roper also published The Last Days of Hitler (1947) on the subject. He subsequently wrote about the Nazis in Hitler's War Directives (1964) and Hitler's Place in History (1965).\n Passage 2:\"A Public Affair\" was released as the album's lead single on June 29, 2006. The song received mixed reviews from critics, with many criticizing its close similarity with \"Holiday\". The song also channeled Janet Jackson with its \"breathy vocals, cheery, almost sickeningly sweet melody\", and \"mid-song giggle\". The music video was shot on June 23, 2006 and the late evening of June 24, 2006 at the Moonlight Rollerway in Glendale, California. It features appearances by Christina Applegate, Christina Milian, Eva Longoria, Maria Menounos, Andy Dick and Ryan Seacrest. On July 19, Simpson visited Total Request Live to world premiere the video. In the chart Billboard Hot Videoclip Tracks peaked at the number 5. The single debuted at number thirty-nine on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, Simpson's second highest debut after \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\". It had previously debuted at number twenty on Billboard's Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart, which represents the twenty-five singles below the Hot 100's number 100 position that have not yet appeared on the Hot 100. Digital download sales were moderate until the release of the single's music video. In late July \"A Public Affair\" joined Ashlee Simpson's song \"Invisible\" in the top ten on the US iTunes Store's list of most popular songs, the first time in iTunes history that two siblings had different songs in the top ten. The song peaked in its fifth week on the Hot 100.\n Passage 3:The story sees Bond pitted against the global criminal organisation Spectre and their leader Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Christoph Waltz). Bond attempts to thwart Blofeld's plan to launch a global surveillance network, and discovers Spectre and Blofeld were behind the events of the previous three films. The film marks Spectre and Blofeld's first appearance in an Eon Productions film since 1971's Diamonds Are Forever; a character resembling Blofeld had previously appeared in the 1981 film, For Your Eyes Only, but, because of the Thunderball controversy, he is not named, nor is his face shown.

Passage 1:The famous and influential Swedish filmmaker, Ingmar Bergman, rose to prominence in the fifties. He began making films in the mid-forties, and in 1955, he made Smiles of a Summer Night, which brought him international attention. A year later, he made one of his most famous films, The Seventh Seal. In the 1960s, Bergman won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film for two consecutive years, with The Virgin Spring (Jungfruk\u00e4llan) in 1960 and Through a Glass Darkly (S\u00e5som i en spegel) in 1961. He won the award again in 1983, for the early twentieth-century family drama Fanny and Alexander (Fanny och Alexander). Bergman has also been nominated for the Best Picture award once, with the 1973 Cries and Whispers (Viskningar och rop), the story of two sisters watching over their third sister's deathbed, both afraid she might die, but hoping she does. The film lost to The Sting, and oddly enough, it was not nominated in the Foreign Language Film category. It also gave Bergman the first of three nominations for Best Director. Ingmar Bergman also won four Golden Globe Awards for Best Foreign Language Film.\n Passage 2:Auckland was New Zealand's second capital from 1841 until 1865, when Parliament was permanently moved to Wellington after an argument that was had for one decade. The initial form of government was an executive council formed of public servant appointed by and responsible to the governor. This changed when the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852, an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that granted self-government to the Colony of New Zealand, was received. This allowed for a bicameral General Assembly (or Parliament), consisting of the Governor, an appointed Legislative Council and an elected House of Representatives, with an Executive Council nominally appointed by the Governor. It also allowed for provincial governments, and six provinces were initially established. The first general election was held in 1853.\n Passage 3:In 1530 John Z\u00e1polya appointed him as the provost of the Buda cathedral and as a royal secretary. Between 1530-1539 he was also the deputy of the King and after his death he remained with his widow, Isabella Jagiellon. In 1541 he moved with her to Transylvania, but he mostly traveled fulfilling diplomatic services because of his disagreement with cardinal Juraj Utje\u0161inovi\u0107's policy of claiming the Hungarian throne for Isabella's and Z\u00e1polya's infant son (instead of conceding it to Ferdinand I as per Treaty of Nagyv\u00e1rad).

Her first award from the association came in 1994 for her performance of \"I Fall to Pieces\", which won her and Aaron Neville the Best Country Collaboration with Vocals accolade. In 1997, she won both the award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance and the Best Country Collaboration with Vocals award. In addition, Yearwood has been given accolades from the Academy of Country Music. She won her first award in 1991 for Top Female Vocalist. She later won in both 1997 and 1998 for Top Female Vocalist. Yearwood has also won three accolades from the Country Music Association, including Female Vocalist of the Year. As a host of the Food Network television show Trisha's Southern Kitchen, Yearwood has been nominated for (and won) the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Culinary Program. \n Passage 2:The NFL forbids religious groups, governments, and non-profit organizations owning a team. The NFL requires a controlling owner to hold at minimum a 30% stake in the team and forbids ownership groups of over 24 people, or any publicly traded corporations from purchasing NFL teams; one team, the Green Bay Packers, is exempt from this under a grandfather clause and is owned by shareholders. The Houston Texans are also grandfathered in for their home county\u2013the Harris County, Texas government\u2013which owns 5% of the team, as the rule forbidding governments from owning a team became effective in 2007. The NFL's constitution also forbids its owners from owning any other professional football teams, except for Arena Football League teams located in the NFL team's home market. In addition, the controlling owners of NFL teams were previously only permitted to own major league baseball, basketball and hockey teams if they were in the NFL team's home market, or were not located in other NFL cities. (Stan Kroenke, who owned hockey and basketball teams in Denver, was nonetheless unanimously allowed to buy the then-St. Louis Rams in 2010 and hold on to his Denver assets until 2015. Even then, the Denver assets were transferred to his wife, Ann.) Soccer has been exempt from these restrictions since 1982, when the league lost a lawsuit filed by the original NASL stemming from the investments of Kansas City Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt and Elizabeth Robbie, the wife of Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie in NASL teams; as a result, NFL owners have owned teams in MLS in other NFL markets. In October 2018, the NFL owners voted to relax the cross-ownership rule, allowing controlling NFL owners to own other professional teams within NFL markets. The league also informally requires prospective owners to have relatively liquid assets and positive cash flow; having a majority of one's wealth invested in real estate, for example, is grounds for rejection.\n Passage 3:Guyot took part to the Wars of the Third and Fourth Coalition with the Grande Arm\u00e9e, holding the rank of squadron commander in the Guard chasseurs-\u00e0-cheval regiment and being noted for bravery at the Austerlitz and Eylau. He fought at the minor Battle of Waren-Nossentin on 1 November 1806. A colonel in the Imperial Guard in 1807, he was created a baron of the Empire the next year and given a position in Lefebvre-Desnouettes's Guard light cavalry, commanding the Emperor's escort during the latter's brief campaign in Spain. In 1809, after the bloody battle of Aspern-Essling, Guyot was given the function of colonel commander of the Guard chasseurs-\u00e0-cheval and six weeks later he led a famous charge at the battle of Wagram. This action would bring him the rank of brigadier general. A Chamberlain of Emperor Napoleon I from March 1810, he was subsequently sent to Spain, where he won a promotion to general of division in 1811. During the Russian campaign and subsequent War of the Sixth Coalition, Guyot would serve as commander of the Guard chasseurs-\u00e0-cheval. In the 1813 campaign in Saxony, he was wounded at the battle of L\u00fctzen and led a brilliant charge at the battle of Bautzen, before being made prisoner at the battle of Kulm, in August. Released after an exchange of prisoners, Guyot took part to the epic battle of Leipzig, before being created a count of the Empire in November of that year. The 1814 campaign in France saw general Guyot at the heart of the action, commanding cavalry at La Rothi\u00e8re, Champaubert and Craonne.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

He later wrote such titles as Marc Spector: Moon Knight, Avengers: Timeslide, X-Man and X-Universe. In Web of Spider-Man #100 (May 1993), Kavanagh and artist Alex Saviuk gave the lead character \"Spider-Armor\". He wrote the Spider-Man/Punisher/Sabretooth: Designer Genes one-shot the following month. Kavanagh was one of the writers on the \"Maximum Carnage\" storyline which ran through the various Spider-Man titles in 1993. The first Black Cat limited series was co-written by Kavanagh and Joey Cavalieri in 1994. Kavanagh pitched a storyline involving the return of Spider-Man's clone, which then formed the basis of the \"Clone Saga\" which began in Web of Spider-Man #117 (Oct. 1994).

At the beginning of the 1980s Gerdes stood out in exhibitions and actions with his criticism of the link between modern art, the museum and the temporary exhibition. At this time he exhibited among others along with Thomas Sch\u00fctte. He pleaded for works of art as a means for the organization of public space and as a medium of communication. The English landscape garden was a particularly important historical model of this to him. At this time he was regarded as the intellectual head of the artist-group of D\u00fcsseldorf pattern makers (D\u00fcsseldorfer Modellbauer). In 1982 he was included in the documenta 7 in Kassel.

However, L\u00fc Bu betrayed his host, seized control of the province and attacked Liu Bei. Liu Bei combined forces with Cao Cao and defeated L\u00fc Bu at the Battle of Xiapi. Liu Bei then followed Cao Cao back to the imperial capital, Xu, where Emperor Xian honoured him as his \"Imperial Uncle\". When Cao Cao showed signs that he wanted to usurp the throne, Emperor Xian wrote a secret decree in blood to his father-in-law, Dong Cheng, and ordered him to get rid of Cao.

His testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee was well received, and made multiple headlines. Slate referred to him in a headline as: \"Clint Watts, Testifier Extraordinaire\", and \"The star of March\u2019s Senate Intelligence Committee hearing\". CNN profiled him after the testimony in a piece \"Russia investigation: Who is Clint Watts\", where it was noted he gained knowledge in the field of Russian cyber hacking methods, after himself being a target in 2015 following his \"Trolling for Trump\" article; the FBI notified the Foreign Policy Research Institute of the attack. Salon compared his testimony \"follow the trail of dead Russians\" to John Dean's statement about \"a cancer on the presidency\". This phrase in testimony by Watts was highlighted by the media, including CBS News, The American Interest, and The Oregonian. U.S. Senator Ron Wyden found the comment important to his investigation. Mark Shields of PBS NewsHour found his testimony \"compelling\", and CNN called it \"blistering\".

This opinion was, however, rejected by the Conservative leadership and former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers, as well as by former Labour minister Caroline Flint who suggested that Gordon Brown may have sought an agreement with the DUP in 2010. The Conservative peer and former UUP First Minister of Northern Ireland, David Trimble, described claims that an agreement would put the peace process at risk as \"scaremongering\". On 13 June former Conservative Prime Minister John Major publicly urged May to govern without DUP support and not pursue a deal, on the grounds that an agreement could \"damage\" the \"fragile\" Northern Ireland peace process, suggesting the government must remain 'impartial'. Major himself had an agreement with the Unionist MPs of the UUP when in power and during peace negotiations in Northern Ireland, though not with the more hardline and socially-conservative DUP. On 15 June Sinn F\u00e9in's Gerry Adams met with Theresa May, telling her that he thought she was in breach of the Good Friday Agreement. This has been disputed by one of the UUP's negotiators for the Belfast Agreement.\n Passage 3:Since 1995, 69 commercial video games based on Lego, the construction system produced by The Lego Group, have been released.

Based on survey by Geological Department of Kota Kinabalu, the Skull Hill is said to be an island in its previous form but since the coral limestone terrace of the peninsula have risen from between 100 metres to 130 metres in the past 20,000 years, the hill are not island but a mountainous ridge near the coast. Through a survey on the geothermal presence in the peninsula, the area have a potential to develop geothermal energy as part of the Sabah's renewable energy.

Passage 1:At the time, the term \"Southern Syria\" referred to a political position which implied support for the Greater Syria nationalism associated with the kingdom promised to the Hashemites of the Hejaz by the British during World War I. After the war, the Hashemite prince Faisal attempted to establish such a Pan-Syrian or pan-Mashriq state (i.e. a united kingdom that would comprise all of modern Syria, as well as Mount Lebanon and Palestine, including Transjordan, so that Palestine would be the province of \"Southern Syria\"). This kingdom was to be united with the other Hashemite domains in Hejaz and Iraq, thus contributing in large measure towards the fulfillment of Pan-Arabist ambitions. However, he was stymied by conflicting promises made by the British to different parties (see Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement, Balfour Declaration and McMahon\u2013Hussein Correspondence), leading to the Franco-Syrian War, which destroyed the Arab Kingdom of Syria in 1920.\n Passage 2:Hispanos identify strongly with their Spanish heritage and most are also mestizos of mixed Apache, Comanche, Pueblo, Navajo, Native Mexican, and Gen\u00edzaro ancestry. Exact numbers for the population size of New Mexican Hispanos is difficult, as many also identify with Chicano and Mexican-American movements. For most of its modern history, New Mexico existed on the periphery of the Spanish empire from 1598 until 1821 and later Mexico (1821\u20131848), but was dominated by Comancheria politically and economically from the 1750s to 1850s. Due to the Comanche, contact with the rest of Spanish America was limited, and New Mexican Spanish developed closer trading links with the Comanche than the rest of New Spain. In the meantime, some Spanish colonists coexisted with and intermarried with Puebloan peoples and Navajos, enemies of the Comanche. New Mexicans of all ethnicities were commonly enslaved by the Comanche and Apache of Apacheria, while Native New Mexicans were commonly enslaved and adopted Spanish language and culture. These Gen\u00edzaros served as house servants, sheep herders, and in other capacities in New Mexico including what is known today as Southern Colorado well into the 1800s. By the late 18th century, Gen\u00edzaros and their descendants, often referred to as Coyotes, comprised nearly one-third of the entire population of New Mexico. After the Mexican\u2013American War, New Mexico and all its inhabitants came under the governance of the English-speaking United States, and for the next hundred years, English-speakers increased in number. By the 1980s, more and more Hispanos were using English instead of New Mexican Spanish at home.\n Passage 3:On 13 December 2008 it was reported on ESPN Deportes that the Los Angeles Galaxy had made a $10\u00a0million offer to Internacional for D'Alesandro but was declined. Their vice president Fernando Carvalho was quoted; \"The offer came from the Los Angeles Galaxy of the United States. I didn't even want to listen to the details. The offer was for more money than we paid for D'Alessandro, who arrived here for five million euro, but we want to keep the Argentinian.\" D'Alessandro has become one of Internacional's most idolized players of all time along the likes of Falc\u00e3o, Valdomiro, and Fernand\u00e3o. In 2008, he was part of Inter's Sulamericana Championship. In 2009 Internacional finished in second place in both the Brasileir\u00e3o and Copa do Brasil. In 2010, D'Alessandro led Internacional to their second Libertadores Championship, and was elected the best player in South America for that year; in the 2010 FIFA Club World Cup, he also helped Internacional to a third-place finish, and was awarded the Bronze Ball as the tournament's third best player. In 2011 D'Alessadro had personally an even better year, but Internacional only managed to win the State Gaucho Championship. 2012 was a bad year for both Internacional and D'Alessandro. Furthermore, rumours of him leaving to play in China caused a major distraction; after long drawn out drama he stayed but soon was injured. In 2013 his game improved again, and while Inter only won the State Championship, he was praised as the only positive factor of the team that year. 2014 started well; D'Alessandro continued to play well and led Inter to their 4th straight Gaucho Championship.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

After the introduction of Eurotunnel there was no need for a train ferry, so SNCF was losing money running her. She was acquired by SNAT and Stena Sealink in 1989, which operated the Nord Pas-de-Calais until 31 December 1995. From 1 January 1996 SNAT operated as SeaFrance. The vessel was renamed SeaFrance Nord Pas-de-Calais. SeaFrance operated until November 2011, and was liquidated on 9 January 2012. Eurotunnel won the bid for the three of the former SeaFrance vessels the original name of the vessel was restored, dropping the SeaFrance prefix. MyFerryLink started running on 20 August 2012, although Nord Pas-de-Calais joined in November 2012 following a refit.

Bianca Grace of Idolator noted that the performance \"will have you repenting your weekend sins, as the singer emotionally sings the tune.\" \"Devil Pray\" was performed on Madonna's 2015\u201316 Rebel Heart Tour. Following the Last Supper-themed mashup performance of \"Holy Water\" and \"Vogue\", Madonna climbed down to the center stage to perform \"Devil Pray\"; during the performance she straddled one of her male dancers, who was dressed as a priest, and engaged in a dance-off with other dancers.

According to the British historian Eliot, parts of city of Karachi and the island of Manora at port of Karachi constituted the city of Debal. The island was the site of a small fort constructed in the eighteenth century when the port of Karachi traded with Oman and Bahrain. The Kalmati Baloch tribe was settled in Karachi and they raised an army to defend the port from the British invasion. The Kalmati forces were defeated when the Manora Fort was stormed by the British in 1839 because of the strategic location of Karachi. Although the fort is now buried beneath the naval base, the lighthouse is a visible reminder of the British presence having been built in 1889 by the Canadian engineer Alain-Chartier-de-Lotbiniere Joly de Lotbini\u00e8re to assist vessels approaching Karachi harbor.\n Passage 2:Dark Heresy is considered a progressive death metal band. Dark Heresy's 1993 demo Diabolus in Musica was praised for amalgamating \"well-chosen sprinklings of classic Morbid Angel with a UK death [metal] flair\", and for mixing thrash \"with classy chunks of unapologetic metal.\" Although dismissed by rock music magazine Kerrang! as \"a widdly Carcass\", their 1995 album Abstract Principles Taken to Their Logical Extremes was praised by extreme music magazine Terrorizer, who wrote that \"Dark Heresy's music is not about mind-numbing brutality and dazzling speed, but is about complex and reflective musical structures supporting complex ideas ... while the vocals swing from gruff grunts to choral chants\", and described Diabolus In Musica as \"one of the most inventive works from an occultist band.\" Writing in Isten magazine in 1996, Endre Begby described Dark Heresy as \"speak[ing] a tonal language very uncommon in death metal\" and \"break[ing] out of the fifth and major/minor third patterns.\" He similarly compared part of Abstract Principles Taken to Their Logical Extremes to Morbid Angel's 1989 debut album Altars of Madness, while noting that other parts are \"totally flipped out, finding no comparison in modern metal\", and summing up that Dark Heresy \"fuck with the very foundation of death metal as we know it\". Heavy metal and hard rock website Worshipmetal.com agreed with these assessments when revisiting Abstract Principles Taken to Their Logical Extremes in 2017, noting the complex compositions, and adding that Dark Heresy \"seemed to throw every single idea into the mix, culminating in a bewildering experience that managed to be both beautiful and brutal in the same breath\", and finding similarities between Dark Heresy's music and that of Carcass, Pestilence, and the Mahavishnu Orchestra, and describing their approach to songwriting as \"difficult to pin down but ... utterly unique nonetheless.\"\n Passage 3:The Treaty of Speyer or Peace of Speyer was signed on May 23, 1544 between Denmark-Norway and the Holy Roman Empire during an Imperial Diet of the Holy Roman Empire in Speyer, Germany.

Under pressure from Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, he agreed to exempt the Dutch ships from these tolls and give them free and unfettered access to the Baltic. In the treaty, Charles V also recognized Christian III as the rightful king of Denmark and Norway, and promised not to provide military support to his rival Christian II. The Treaty of Speyer dictated Christian III's foreign policy for the rest of his life.

James Woolsey, Elliot Abrams, Donald Rumsfeld, Robert Zoellick, and John Bolton were among the signatories of an open letter initiated by the PNAC to President Bill Clinton calling for the removal of Saddam Hussein. Portraying Saddam Hussein as a threat to the United States, its Middle East allies, and oil resources in the region, and emphasizing the potential danger of any weapons of mass destruction under Iraq's control, the letter asserted that the United States could \"no longer depend on our partners in the Gulf War to continue to uphold the sanctions or to punish Saddam when he blocks or evades UN inspections.\" Stating that American policy \"cannot continue to be crippled by a misguided insistence on unanimity in the UN Security Council,\" the letter's signatories asserted that \"the U.S. has the authority under existing UN resolutions to take the necessary steps, including military steps, to protect our vital interests in the Gulf.\" Believing that UN sanctions against Iraq would be an ineffective means of disarming Iraq, PNAC members also wrote a letter to Republican members of the U.S. Congress Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott, urging Congress to act, and supported the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 (H.R.4655) which President Clinton signed into law in October 1998.\n Passage 2:In the early 1940s, he met Pearl Primus at the National Youth Administration and became her first dance partner before studying dance with Syvilla Fort and Katherine Dunham.

In October 1973, Amtrak replaced the rolling stock with the new French-built Turboliner; as part of this change the trains were re-branded as Turboliners and truncated to Chicago. In February 1976 Amtrak returned conventional rolling stock to the route and revived the Abraham Lincoln name along with the Ann Rutledge. Amtrak added the State House to the Chicago-St. Louis corridor in 1977.

Passage 1:Hot on the heels of the huge success of CSNY and Led Zeppelin, British band Yes rapidly established themselves as one of the leading groups in the burgeoning progressive rock genre, and their success also played a significant part in establishing the primacy of the long-playing album as the major sales format for rock music in the 1970s. After several lineup changes during 1969\u201370, the band settled into its \"classic\" incarnation, with guitarist Steve Howe and keyboard player Rick Wakeman, who both joined during 1971. Although the extended length of much of their material made it somewhat difficult to promote the band with single releases, their live prowess gained them an avid following and their albums were hugely successful \u2013 their third LP The Yes Album (1971), which featured the debut of new guitarist Steve Howe, became their first big hit, reaching #4 in the UK and just scraping onto the chart in the US at #40.

This star is among those earlier described by Antonia Maury as having a composite spectrum. The first orbit was determined in 1924 by William Edmund Harper using measurements taken at Dominion Observatory, his orbital elements are very similar to the most recent determinations. Harper also noticed that the composite nature of the spectrum had disappeared on the one plate when the K type primary was nearest the sun indicating a possible eclipse. In 1932 the eclipsing binary nature of the system was confirmed by Paul Guthnick, Heribert Schneller and independently Josef Hopmann.\n Passage 2:Haskell was born in Palmyra, Maine in 1843 to Aretas Haskell and Sophia Hathorn (Haskell). He attended Bates College's Nichols Latin School/Maine Central Institute. Haskell was a great-nephew of Seth Hathorn who donated Bates' first building.

Passage 1:Under Gruden, the Raiders posted consecutive 8\u20138 seasons in 1998 and 1999, and leapt out of last place in the AFC West. After uniting with journeyman quarterback Rich Gannon, Gruden led the Raiders to the top of the AFC West and they made the playoffs in three consecutive seasons from 2000 to 2002 (the third season was under head coach Bill Callahan).

In this capacity, he participated in King Andrew's royal campaign against Albert of Austria in the summer of 1291. According to his uncle's donation letter from 1299, Sinka bravely fought under the city walls of Vienna. He seriously injured during these clashes, as Andrew's privilege charter from 1300 narrates. He remained in the service of the Baksas for the following years. According to two documents issued by later family members in 1314 and 1317, a certain \"Bohemian potentate\" Wytk, who resided in S\u00e1ros Castle (present-day \u0160ari\u0161 in Slovakia), invaded George Baksa's seat S\u00f3v\u00e1r (today Solivar, a borough of Pre\u0161ov in Slovakia) and seized its salt well. Sinka led a military unit and successfully recovered the estate, while captured Wytk and burned the Bohemian lord's nearby fort. The 1317 charter contradicts this and narrates that Sinka already prevented Wytk from occupying the salt well. Some historians considered that the events occurred sometime between 1301 and 1305, during the brief reign of Wenceslaus, who installed his Bohemian partisans to several castles in Northeast Hungary. For a number of reasons, however, historian Attila Zsoldos argued the events occurred still during the reign of Andrew III and put the date to sometime before July 1294. In that year, Andrew confiscated Tam\u00e1si in Szepes County (today Spi\u0161sk\u00e9 Tom\u00e1\u0161ovce in Slovakia) from George Baksa and his brothers because of their \"disloyalty\", as they \"ravaged the realm\" and \"captured and wounded\" Wytk, the royal castellan of S\u00e1ros. Zsoldos identified the castellan with Wytk Lud\u00e1ny, who came from a kindred of Bohemian origin, as Simon of K\u00e9za's Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum preserved. The historian suggested that Wytk unlawfully tried to extend his influence over S\u00f3v\u00e1r by abusing the power of his position, but George Baksa and his nephew Sinka successfully repulsed the attack. Andrew III, whose whole reign was characterized by the confrontations with the oligarchs, regarded this act as a treachery without consideration of all aspects.\n Passage 3:Four days before the end of the Second World War, undefended Bergen was occupied by the Red Army on 4 May 1945. After the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) was founded, the new government pressed ahead with further industrialization. In 1952, construction began on the industrial area on the town's western outskirts. From 1953 to 1958, the dairy was established, which furnished 300\u00a0tonnes of milk daily. In 1955/1956 came the establishment of the VEB Brot- und Backwaren (Bread and Baked Goods). In 1957/1958, the slaughterhouse and meat plant went into production. An efficient food industry was set up in Bergen, supplied from the island and parts of the mainland. Since Reunification and East Germany's accession into the Federal Republic, the town has undergone a number of marked changes. The population dwindled from its former level of almost 20,000 to 16,500. Many prefabricated concrete structures, common in the former Warsaw Pact countries, were modernized and adapted to new demands. In addition, a few schools were closed and new hotels built. Historical downtown was completely renovated and decorated, giving it a new appeal.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

The first practical large-scale method of blood plasma fractionation was developed by Edwin J. Cohn during World War II. It is known as the Cohn process (or Cohn method). This process is also known as cold ethanol fractionation as it involves gradually increasing the concentration of ethanol in the solution at 5C and 3C. The Cohn Process exploits differences in properties of the various plasma proteins, specifically, the high solubility and low pI of albumin. As the ethanol concentration is increased in stages from 0% to 40% the [pH] is lowered from neutral (pH ~ 7) to about 4.8, which is near the pI of albumin. At each stage certain proteins are precipitated out of the solution and removed. The final precipitate is purified albumin. Several variations to this process exist, including an adapted method by Nitschmann and Kistler that uses fewer steps and replaces centrifugation and bulk freezing with filtration and diafiltration.\n Passage 3:Roger Brito is listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as holding land under the overlordship of the Church of Long Sutton in Somerset, in which county the family was later seated at Sampford Brett (alias Sandford-Bret).

Until the Great Migration of the 1930s, African Americans were a majority of Mississippi's population. Mississippi was the site of many prominent events during the American Civil Rights movement, including the 1962 Ole Miss riots, the 1963 assassination of Medgar Evers, and the 1964 Freedom Summer murders. Mississippi frequently ranks low among states in measures of health, education, and development, and high in measures of poverty. In 2010, 37.3% of Mississippi's population was African American, the highest percentage for any state.\n Passage 3:Paiva Couceiro arrived in Luanda, Angola on September 1, 1889, and was immediately appointed commander of the Irregular Cavalry Squadron in the village of Humpata (which was originally created by Artur de Paiva to combat bands of guerrillas along the plain of Mo\u00e7\u00e2medes). He did not remain at this outpost for long; apparently he was unsatisfied with his subordinates, their methods and inferior level of discipline, but was able to utilize them in a campaign to retrieve missing cattle, instead of hiring local Boer mercenaries, which had been the custom. By January he was in the village of Belmonte, in Bi\u00e9, on a mission that would take him along the Cuando River, to Cuito and then to the Lialui along the Zambezi River (a trek of thousands of kilometers across savannah), in order to negotiate with Lewanika, chief of the Barotze tribe. The growth of the Portuguese occupation force in the Angolan interior was part of the administration's attempted to implement their Pink Map to explore and expand their serfdom over the peoples of the central-African interior. After some resistance, the colonial administration began a military campaign to pacify groups that had resisted initial token gestures of friendship and gifts, a process that Paiva Couceiro participated in energetically. For the chief's recognition of Portuguese sovereignty over his territories, Paiva Couceiro brought with him a colonels tunic and sword, textiles, gold, velvet, boxes of Porto wine and arms, which were to be delivered in 300 crates when the Governor of Angola canceled the project.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:Critic Janet Maslin, writing in The New York Times, said of director Kasdan, \"he creates the film's most satisfying moments by communicating his own sheer enjoyment in revitalizing scenes and images that are so well-loved.\" Impressed, she exclaimed, \"Silverado is a sweeping, glorious-looking western that's at least a full generation removed from the classic films it brings to mind.\" Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times called it \"sophisticated\" while remarking, \"This is a story, you will agree, that has been told before. What distinguishes Kasdan's telling of it is the style and energy he brings to the project.\" In the San Francisco Chronicle, Peter Stack wrote that the film \"delivers elaborate gun-fighting scenes, legions of galloping horses, stampeding cattle, a box canyon, covered wagons, tons of creaking leather and even a High Noonish duel.\" He openly mused, \"How it manages to run the gamut of cowboy movie elements without getting smart-alecky is intriguing.\" In a mixed review, Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune, said the film was \"a completely successful physical attempt at reviving the western, but its script would need a complete rewrite for it to become more than just a small step in a full-scale western revival.\" Another ambivalent review came from Jay Carr of The Boston Globe. He noted that Silverado \"plays like a big-budget regurgitation of old Westerns. What keeps it going is the generosity that flows between Kasdan and his actors. It's got benevolent energies, but not the more primal kind needed to renew the standard Western images and archetypes.\" In an entirely negative critique, film critic Jay Scott of The Globe and Mail said the all too familiar \"manipulative Star Wars-style score is the only novelty on tap in Silverado, which has a plot too drearily complicated and arid to summarize\". Left equally unimpressed was Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader. Commenting on director Kasdan's style, he said his \"considerable skills as a plot carpenter seem to desert him as soon as the story moves to the town of the title.\" As far as the supporting cast was concerned, he dryly noted, \"none of them assumes enough authority to carry the moral and dramatic center of the film.\" Giving Silverado 4 out of 5 stars, author Ian Freer of Empire, thought the film was the \"kind of picture that makes you want to play cowboys the moment it is over.\" He exclaimed, \"Whereas many of the westerns from the \u201870s try a revisionist take on the genre, Silverado offers a wholehearted embracing of western traditions.\"\n Passage 2:The most famous former resident of the Priory Estate is Duncan Edwards, who was born two miles away at Holly Hall but moved to 31 Elm Road as a small child and went on to play 18 times for England as well as winning two Football League championships with Manchester United before he died in 1958 at the age of 21 from injuries sustained in the Munich air disaster. As a child, he had attended Priory Primary School and then Wolverhampton Street School. The school is most famous for being the former school (1941 to 1948) of the late Duncan Edwards, the former Manchester United and England footballer. He died aged 21 as a result of the Munich air disaster in 1958. After his death, a stained glass window was dedicated to Edwards at St Francis parish church at the junction of Laurel Road and Poplar Crescent. The church was founded during 1931 and originally based at Priory Hall before the church building on the newly developed housing estate was opened on 10 May 1932.\n Passage 3:The Yasui procedure is a pediatric heart operation used to bypass the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) that combines the aortic repair of the Norwood procedure and a shunt similar to that used in the Rastelli procedure in a single operation. It is used to repair defects that result in the physiology of hypoplastic left heart syndrome even though both ventricles are functioning normally. These defects are common in DiGeorge syndrome and include interrupted aortic arch and LVOT obstruction (IAA/LVOTO); aortic atresia-severe stenosis with ventricular septal defect (AA/VSD); and aortic atresia with interrupted aortic arch and aortopulmonary window. This procedure allows the surgeon to keep the left ventricle connected to the systemic circulation while using the pulmonary valve as its outflow valve, by connecting them through the ventricular septal defect. The Yasui procedure includes a modified Damus\u2013Kaye\u2013Stansel procedure to connect the aortic and pulmonary roots, allowing the coronary arteries to remain perfused. It was first described in 1987.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Yamagumo, under the command of Lieutenant Commander Yasuji Koga, was flagship of the 3rd Special Attack Force in the invasion of the Philippines, covering landings at Camiguin Island and Lingayen. However, on 31 December, she suffered severe damage after striking a Japanese naval mine. She was towed to Hong Kong for repairs in early February, and then limped to Yokosuka Naval Arsenal by 7 April. She remained under repair until 15 May 1942 but remained based at Yokosuka through the end of August 1942. She made one escort mission to Saipan at the end of December 1942. In February 1943, while attempting to escort Tatsuta Maru to Truk, she was unable to prevent the former luxury liner from being torpedoed by the submarine with the loss of 1,400 lives just east-southeast of Mikurajima.\n Passage 2:Timon of Phlius ( ; , , ; BC \u2013 c. 235 BC) was a Greek Pyrrhonist philosopher, a pupil of Pyrrho, and a celebrated writer of satirical poems called Silloi (). He was born in Phlius, moved to Megara, and then he returned home and married. He next went to Elis with his wife, and heard Pyrrho, whose tenets he adopted. He also lived on the Hellespont, and taught at Chalcedon, before moving to Athens, where he lived until his death. His writings were said to have been very numerous. He composed poetry, tragedies, satiric dramas, and comedies, of which very little remains. His most famous composition was his Silloi, a satirical account of famous philosophers, living and dead; a spoudaiogeloion in hexameter verse. The Silloi has not survived intact, but it is mentioned and quoted by several ancient authors.\n Passage 3:\"Sandcastles in the Sand\" is a song written by Craig Thomas and Carter Bays for the CBS television series How I Met Your Mother. The song was performed by Canadian actress Cobie Smulders in the role of Robin Scherbatsky, who has a secret past as a teenage Canadian pop star under the stage name Robin Sparkles. A follow-up to \"Let's Go to the Mall\" (2006), \"Sandcastles in the Sand\" was inspired by several 1980s pop ballads. The song was made available for streaming on April\u00a015, 2008, before it appeared in an episode of the same name that aired on April\u00a021.

Passage 1:Finn's first commission was as project manager for the Rice Hotel, under contract with the firm of Mauran, Russell & Crowell. The owner of the new hotel, Jesse H. Jones, soon after established a collaboration with Finn which would change the face of Downtown Houston. Finn designed two buildings for Jones across the way from the Rice Hotel: the Foster Building, aka the Houston Chronicle Building, in 1914, and the Rusk Building in 1916. The corner of Texas and Travis was dominated by buildings built by Finn and Jones. In 1926, Finn designed a new seventeen-story wing for the Rice Hotel on behalf of Jones. Finn did architectural work for other commercial clients in the 1920s. He completed State National Bank Building (NHRP-listed) at 412 Main Street in 1923. Jones contracted with Finn to build the Lamar Hotel, where Jones established his new residence. The Jones apartment consumed the whole top floor, though he hired John F. Staub for the interior design. Jones also promised a venue for the 1928 Democratic National Convention without consulting the city of Houston, pledging $200,000 of his own capital. He engaged Finn and Kenneth Franzheim to design and erect the Sam Houston Hall in just four months. The Sam Houston Hall, ostensibly built to be a temporary structure, was larger than Madison Square Garden, and equipped with heavy-duty fans and apertures between the roof and the walls to facilitate air flow. Jones contracted with Finn on another project in downtown Houston, this time with in collaboration with Franzheim and J.E.R. Carpenter, to finish the 37-story, art deco Gulf Building in 1929 at that time the tallest building in Texas.\n Passage 2:Crimea: The Last Crusade is a panoramic history of the Crimean War of 1853\u201356. Drawing extensively from Russian, French and Ottoman as well as British archives, it combines military, diplomatic, political and cultural history, examining how the war left a lasting mark on the national consciousness of Britain, France, Russia and Turkey. Figes sets the war in the context of the Eastern Question, the diplomatic and political problems caused by the decay of the Ottoman Empire. In particular, he emphasises the importance of the religious struggle between Russia as the defender of the Orthodox and France as the protector of the Catholics in the Ottoman Empire. He frames the war within a longer history of religious conflict between Christians and Muslims in the Balkans, southern Russia and the Caucasus that continues to this day. Figes stresses the religious motive of the Tsar Nicholas I in his bold decision to go to war, arguing that Nicholas was swayed by the ideas of the Pan-Slavs to invade Moldavia and Wallachia and encourage Slav revolts against the Ottomans, despite his earlier adherence to the Legitimist principles of the Holy Alliance. He also shows how France and Britain were drawn into the war by popular ideas of Russophobia that swept across Europe in the wake of the Revolutions of 1830 and 1848. As one reviewer wrote, Figes shows \"how the cold war of the Soviet era froze over fundamental fault lines that had opened up in the 19th century.\"\n Passage 3:In the spring of 1902, Bulgaria, an Ottoman vassal state which was interested in acquiring Macedonia, signed a military convention with Russia. Late in the fall, Russia, supported by the United Kingdom and France, proposed to the Ottomans political reforms for the Macedonian vilayets. On 8 December, the Ottoman sultan, Abdul Hamid II, signed a decree implementing most of the reforms. In February 1903, the new Russian foreign minister, Vladimir Lamsdorf, visited Vienna and signed the so-called \"Vienna Program\" on Macedonian reforms. The program was substantially the same as the Ottoman decree of December. The immediate provocation of a new agreement at M\u00fcrzsteg was the Ilinden\u2013Preobrazhenie Uprising that broke out on 2 August. With its quick suppression, the Vienna Program lay dead. In September Tsar Nicholas II of Russia visited the Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria-Hungary at the latter's castle in M\u00fcrzsteg, Austria. The two rulers put their signatures to a new memorandum, substantially identical to the Vienna Program, which called for the appointment of one Russian and one Austro-Hungarian civil agent to oversee the reform of the administration, judiciary and local gendarmerie in the Macedonian vilayets. In all these institutions Christians were to take part. After Abdul Hamid accepted the proposal in November, Russia appointed one N. Demerik as its agent, and Austria chose one G. M\u00fcller. They began their work under H\u00fcseyin Hilmi Pasha, the Inspector-General of Macedonia, in early 1904. Under the M\u00fcrzsteg program, each Great Power appointed an advisory official to the Ottoman official in charge of reforming the gendarmerie in each province. Austria-Hungary appointed an advisor to the sanjak of \u00dcsk\u00fcp, Russia to the sanjak of Thessaloniki, France to the sanjak of Siroz and Britain to the sanjak of Drama.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:The piezoelectric properties of quartz were discovered by Jacques and Pierre Curie in 1880. The first quartz crystal oscillator was built by Walter G. Cady in 1921. In 1923, D. W. Dye at the National Physical Laboratory in the UK and Warren Marrison at Bell Telephone Laboratories produced sequences of precision time signals with quartz oscillators. In 1927, the first quartz clock was built by Warren Marrison and J.\u00a0W. Horton at Bell Telephone Laboratories. The next 3 decades saw the development of quartz clocks as precision time standards in laboratory settings; the bulky delicate counting electronics, built with vacuum tubes, limited their use elsewhere. In 1932 a quartz clock was able to measure tiny variations in the rotation rate of the Earth over periods as short as a few weeks. In Japan in 1932, Issac Koga developed a crystal cut that gave an oscillation frequency with greatly reduced temperature dependence. The National Bureau of Standards (now NIST) based the time standard of the US on quartz clocks between the 1930s and the 1960s, after which it transitioned to atomic clocks. The wider use of quartz clock technology had to await the development of cheap semiconductor digital logic in the 1960s. The revised 14th edition of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica stated that quartz clocks would probably never be affordable enough to be used domestically.\n Passage 2:On September 8, 2019, Minshew made his NFL debut against the Kansas City Chiefs when starter Nick Foles was taken out of the game due to a shoulder injury. He completed 22 of 25 passes for 275 yards, two touchdowns and an interception in the 40\u201326 loss. Minshew's pass completion percentage of 88% is the highest of any player making his debut in NFL history (minimum 15 pass attempts, since at least 1950), and also the highest single-game pass completion percentage in Jaguars history. Minshew was named the starter going forward after it was revealed that Foles had suffered a broken clavicle. During Week 2 against the Houston Texans, Minshew finished with 213 passing yards and a touchdown along with 56 rushing yards as the Jaguars lost 13\u201312. In Week 3, against the Tennessee Titans on Thursday Night Football, he earned his first victory as a professional. He passed for 204 yards and two touchdowns in the 20\u20137 victory. In Week 4, against the Denver Broncos, he passed for 213 yards and two touchdowns in the 26\u201324 victory. Late in the game, he engineered a drive that helped set up the Jaguars' game-winning field goal by Josh Lambo. During Week 5 against the Carolina Panthers, Minshew finished with 374 passing yards and two touchdowns as the Jaguars lost 27\u201334. After a Week 6 loss to the New Orleans Saints and a Week 7 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals, he had 279 passing yards and three passing touchdowns in a 29\u201315 victory over the New York Jets. During Week 9 against the Texans at Wembley Stadium, Minshew finished with 309 passing yards and 2 interceptions as the Jaguars lost 3\u201326. Days later, it was announced that Minshew would resume the backup role after Foles returned from his collar bone injury.\n Passage 3:Having played for the Surrey Second XI in 1934 and 1935 in the Minor Counties Championship, Owen joined Durham following World War II. He made his debut for the county in the Minor Counties Championship against the Yorkshire Second XI. He played Minor counties cricket for Durham from 1947 to 1955, making 59 appearances for the county. He made a single first-class appearance for the Minor Counties against Kent in 1951. In this match, he was dismissed in the Minor Counties first-innings by Brian Edrich for 14 runs, while in their second-innings (in which they followed-on) he scored 12 runs before being dismissed by the same bowler. In Kent's only innings, he took the wicket of Dicky Mayes for the cost of 33 runs from 14 overs. Kent went on to win the match by an innings and 10 runs.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

He was also a contributing layout artist on Brave (2012) and Monsters University (2013). In 2015, Lin was the cinematographer on Pixar's Inside Out; his full credited title was \"director of photography \u2013 camera and staging\". On Inside Out, he pioneered Pixar's first use of a virtual camera lens based on an actual camera lens, so that the animation appears to be filmed on an actual camera. He later served as a layout artist on The Good Dinosaur (2015) and director of photography on Toy Story 4 (2019).

At fourteen, Barker\u2019s family relocated to Englewood, Florida. He attended Lemon Bay High School and graduated in 1989. He enrolled at the Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale where he later obtained a degree in business. While in college, a writing assignment found its way into the hands of Paul Gallotta of Circus Magazine. Gallotta reached out to Barker and asked him to join the staff of 25th Parallel (magazine) where he worked alongside the man who would later become Marilyn Manson. Assignments dropped him into the center of pop culture and by 1991 Barker branched out, interviewing celebrities for the likes of Seventeen, TeenBeat, and other national and local publications. In 1992, Barker syndicated a small newspaper column called Revealed which centered around the investigation of haunted places and supernatural occurrences. He began work as a ghost writer and book doctor, helping other authors for publication. Barker cites Stephen King, Dean Koontz, John Saul, and Neil Gaiman among his influences.\n Passage 3:Pierre was born in Southall, London. He started his career in the youth system at Fulham, but was released in 2011. Pierre (along with former Fulham youth teammates Jonathan Cosgrove, Albert Owusu-Ansah and Michael Kamau) joined League One side Brentford on trial in April 2011 and was the only one of the four to earn a contract. Pierre was made part of the Development Squad for its inaugural season in 2011\u201312. He made his professional debut for the Bees on 4 December 2012, in a 2\u20131 defeat to Southend United in the Football League Trophy, coming on as a substitute for Jake Bidwell. Pierre was an unused substitute on four further occasions during the 2012\u201313 season. Towards the end of the campaign, Pierre spent a period training with Brentford's Icelandic partner club UMF Selfoss. Pierre was the leading appearance-maker for the Development Squad in the 2012\u201313 season, making 19 starts and scoring two goals, in addition to his solitary first team appearance. On 20 June 2013, he signed a new one-year contract which will tie him to the club until the summer of 2014. He made his first appearance of the 2013\u201314 season on 27 August 2013, coming on at half time for Scott Barron in a 5\u20130 League Cup defeat away at Derby County. His second appearance came in a 5\u20133 Football League Trophy first round win over AFC Wimbledon the following week, again replacing Scott Barron at half time. Pierre was made available for loan in October 2013 and attracted interest from Conference Premier clubs Aldershot Town and Cambridge United. Pierre was again made available for loan in February 2014, but expressed a desire to open talks over a new contract the following month. Though he spent portions of the 2013\u201314 season out on loan, Pierre finished the campaign with two first team appearances and 12 Development Squad appearances. In early May, it was reported that Pierre had been offered a new contract, after impressing in his loan spells away from Griffin Park during the 2013\u201314 season. On 16 May, it was reported that Pierre turned down the contract offer and left the club.

Passage 1:The modern Albanian-Serbian conflict has its roots in the expulsion of the Albanians in 1877-1878 from areas that became incorporated into the Principality of Serbia. Prior to the outbreak of the First Balkan War, the Albanian nation was fighting for a national state. At the end of 1912, the Porte recognised the autonomy of Albanian vilayet. These events for Albanian autonomy and Ottoman weakness were viewed at the time as directly threatening the Christian population of the region with extermination. The Balkan League (comprising Serbia, Montenegro, Greece and Bulgaria) jointly attacked the Ottoman Empire and during the next few months partitioned all Ottoman territory inhabited by Albanians. The Kingdom of Serbia and the Kingdom of Greece occupied most of the land of what is today Albania and other lands inhabited by Albanians on the Adriatic coast. Montenegro occupied a part of today's northern Albania around Shkod\u00ebr. The Serbian army in the region viewed its role as protecting local Orthodox Christian communities and avenging the medieval battle of Kosovo, though it forced Catholic Albanians to convert to Orthodox Christianity.\n Passage 2:Nait\u014d Yorinao was the seventh son of Nait\u014d Yoriyasu. However, as all of his elder brothers died in childhood he became daimy\u014d in 1859 on the retirement of his father. In 1860, he established a han school, the Shintoku-kan (\u9032\u5fb3\u9928) in Takat\u014d. He served as part of the escort to Princess Kazunomiya during her travel to Edo to marry the Shogun Tokugawa Iemochi in 1861. Following the Namamugi Incident of 1862, during which British subjects were killed by the retinue of Shimazu Hisamitsu, he was ordered by the shogunate to deploy his troops to Yokohama to increase security. These troops subsequently accompanied the Shogun's forces during the First Ch\u014dsh\u016b expedition. However, with the start of the Boshin War in 1868, Takat\u014d quickly joined the imperial side against the Tokugawa. Even so, the domain was ordered to pay 2000 ry\u014d to the new Meiji government to help pay for war expenses. Troops from Takat\u014d participated in the Battle of Aizu under the command of Prince Saionji Kinmochi. Yorinao was appointed imperial governor of Takat\u014d in 1869, serving until the abolition of the han system in 1871. He relocated to Tokyo at that time, and died in 1879. His grave is at the temple of Taiz\u014d-ji in Shinjuku, Tokyo.\n Passage 3:In 1575, in the middle of the Wars of Religion, the castle was strengthened. It was nevertheless besieged and taken by the Geuzen, locally known as the Hurlus in 1579, before being taken back three months later. In 1627, Philip IV of Spain promoted the seigneury to the rank of county. The Franco-Dutch War under Louis XIV devastated this mostly agricultural region. Mouscron and the surrounding area became French after the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668). Part of it rejoined the Southern Netherlands after the Treaty of Nijmegen (1678), which drew the frontier right through its territory. It was finally completely ceded to the Southern Netherlands under the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The textile industry started in Mouscron in the 1760s thanks to the imposition by Lille of a ban on the fabrication of molletons, a mixture of flax and wool, in Roubaix and Tourcoing.

The original masonry and towers date back to the 9th century CE, as seen from an inscription in the structure made by Chola kings. The Chola kings ruled over the region for more than four centuries, from 850 CE to 1280 CE, and were temple patrons. The temple complex dates from the time of the 10th century AD Medieval Chola king Uttama Chola whose inscriptions are found in its walls. An inscription dated to the fifteenth year of Raja Raja Chola makes a reference to \"Panchavanmahadevi chaturvedimanagalam\", which is another name for Nallur. There are also inscription by Later Chola kings and by Hoysala monarchs. The inscriptions from the Chola kings record various gifts like land, sheep, cow and oil to the temple commemorating various victories of the dynasty. There are lot of inscriptions from the Sangama Dynasty (1336\u20131485 CE), Saluva Dynasty, and Tuluva Dynasty (1491\u20131570 CE) of the Vijayanagara Empire, reflecting gifts to the temple from their rulers. The majority of the gift related inscriptions are for land endownments, followed by goods, cash endowments, cows and oil for lighting lamps. The temple has been maintained by the Thiruvaduthurai Adheenam from the early part of the 13th century.\n Passage 2:For the lead roles, Christopher Meloni was cast as Detective Elliot Stabler and Mariska Hargitay was cast as Detective Olivia Benson after they auditioned together. Hargitay, who had to move from Los Angeles to New York when she got the role, said she was able to do this on short notice because she was already planning on moving to New York to pursue a Broadway career. The squad commander role was filled by Dann Florek, who had portrayed Captain Don Cragen for the first three seasons on the original Law & Order and later reprised his role in . He joined the cast on the condition that he not be asked to audition. Richard Belzer was cast as Detective John Munch, continuing his role from the series . In Belzer's words, he was cast because \"Dick Wolf and Tom Fontana got drunk at a party\". Halfway through the season, Richard Belzer reprised his role of Munch in , which briefly shows his character out on a case in his SVU context in New York. At Belzer's insistence, his character was partnered with Brian Cassidy, who was portrayed by Dean Winters. However, Winters' contractual obligation to the HBO series Oz forced him to leave halfway through the season. Michelle Hurd, who portrayed Detective Monique Jeffries, filled Winters' void for the remainder of the season, and was at that point added to the main credits.\n Passage 3:The old name forms of Waldb\u00f6ckelheim (now a neighbouring municipality), Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheim and Talb\u00f6ckelheim (now an outlying centre), can be traced back to an 824 document that names . The name Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheim first cropped up only in the 17th century. In the 19th century, the name Thalb\u00f6ckelheim first came to light. On 1 November 1910, municipal council agreed to introduce Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheim as the municipality's name. The name Talb\u00f6ckelheim seems to have had its spelling changed in line with the spelling reforms over the years; it is now written without the first H, but the name Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheim itself has not been changed in the wake of the German orthography reform of 1996; the \u00df has not been changed to SS. The three prefixes that serve to distinguish the three centres whose names are otherwise the same are all standard German words with well understood meanings: Wald (\u201cforest\u201d); Schlo\u00df (or Schloss in up-to-date spelling; \u201ccastle/palace\u201d); Tal (\u201cdale/valley\u201d). The village chronicle has this to say about the village's name:Until the beginning of the last century (meant here is the 19th century) the village was named after the castle Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheim, which still existed in the 17th century. The castle was destroyed by the French in 1688. The village of Thalb\u00f6ckelheim consists of the two constituent centres of Thalb\u00f6ckelheim and Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheim: Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheim with the ruin of Castle B\u00f6ckelheim lies on the mountainside and the constituent centre of Thalb\u00f6ckelheim lies 0.5\u00a0km away down in the dale. Both constituent centres have roughly the same population figure. The village\u2019s name was changed in quite a peculiar way. In the early part of the last century, in response to an inquiry by the authorities as to what the village was called, because it consisted of two constituent centres, the name Thalb\u00f6ckelheim was given by the then Sch\u00f6ffe (roughly \u201clay jurist\u201d). The Sch\u00f6ffe lived in the constituent centre of Thalb\u00f6ckelheim and a certain selfishness on his part made him want to call the village Thalb\u00f6ckelheim, without regard to the historical importance of the constituent centre of Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheim. None of the locally customary rural cadastral names had to do with the name Thalb\u00f6ckelheim, but rather they were named after Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheim, like Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheimer M\u00fchlberg, Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheimer Felsenberg, Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheimer Kupfergrube and so on. Wines had earned quite an important reputation as Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheimer in the wine trade, whereas Thalb\u00f6ckelheim never cropped up in the wine trade. Municipal council asked on these grounds to have the historical name Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheim reinstated, as it was already well known throughout Germany for Emperor Heinrich IV\u2019s imprisonment at Castle B\u00f6ckelheim (1105).Also given as grounds for the reversion to the older name was the name's recognizability in winegrowing and the wine trade. A decree made on 22 April 1911 approved the municipality's application. Since this time, the two constituent centres of Thalb\u00f6ckelheim and Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheim have been united under the collective name \u201cSchlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheim\u201d. Among the places in the middle Naheraum (regions flanking the Nahe), Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheim belongs among those places that were already often being mentioned in the Middle Ages. Castle B\u00f6ckelheim, built on what was to become Schlo\u00dfb\u00f6ckelheim's municipal area, was among the oldest in the region. Generally regarded as the village's first documentary mention is a document from 16 February 824. Late in 1105, Emperor Heinrich V, the last of the Salian dynasty, had his father, Emperor Heinrich IV taken prisoner in Ingelheim and then brought to Castle B\u00f6ckelheim to be held prisoner there. In 1688, the Nine Years' War (known in Germany as the Pf\u00e4lzischer Erbfolgekrieg, or War of the Palatine Succession) broke out. That year, the castle was destroyed on French orders.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:The 9th Armored Division landed in Normandy late in September 1944, and first went into the line, 23 October 1944, on patrol duty in a quiet sector along the Luxembourg-German frontier. When the Germans launched their winter offensive on 16 December 1944, the 9th, with no real combat experience, suddenly found itself engaged in heavy fighting. The Division saw its severest action at St. Vith, Echternach, and Bastogne, its units fighting in widely separated areas. Its stand at Bastogne held off the Germans long enough to enable the 101st Airborne Division to dig in for a defense of the city. After a rest period in January 1945, the Division prepared to drive across the Roer River. The offensive was launched on 28 February 1945 and the 9th crossed the Roer to Rheinbach, sending patrols into Remagen. On 7 March 1945, elements of the 9th Armored found that the Ludendorff Bridge was still standing. When German demolition charges failed to bring the bridge down, they crossed it, disarming and removing the remaining charges, which could have exploded at any time. The Division exploited the bridgehead, moving south and east across the Lahn River toward Limburg, where thousands of Allied prisoners were liberated from Stalag XIIA. The Division drove on to Frankfurt and then turned to assist in the closing of the Ruhr Pocket. In April it continued east, encircling Leipzig and securing a line along the Mulde River. The Division was shifting south to Czechoslovakia when the war in Europe ended on 9 May 1945. All units of CCB/9 AIB of the 9th Armored Division were awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for their actions in taking and defending the Ludendorff Bridge during the Battle of Remagen in World War II.\n Passage 2:Charles I is supposed to have created him a baronet 4 May 1645. Of this creation, the first of a physician to that rank, no record exists, but the accurate Le Neve did not doubt the fact, and explained the absence of enrolment. He claimed to have been Physician-General to the army of Charles I. With his friend Walter Charleton, Greaves became travelling physician to Charles II, but settled in London in 1653, and was admitted a fellow of the College of Physicians 18 October 1657. He delivered the Harveian oration at the College of Physicians 25 July 1661 (London, 1667, 4to), of which the original manuscript is in the British Museum (Sloane 302). He says that before Harvey the source of the circulation was as unknown as that of the Nile, and compares England to a heart, whence the knowledge of the circulation was driven forth to other lands. He became physician in ordinary to Charles II, and owned the lands of St Leonard's Forest in Sussex, including that part which became Leonardslee. He married Alicia Nevett (1624\u20131684), widow of Peter Calf (d. 1668). Greaves lived in Covent Garden, died there 11 Nov. 1680, and was buried in the church of St. Paul's, Covent Garden.\n Passage 3:The rates of Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis are increased when compared with the general population, by a factor of 3.8 and 7.5 respectively. People with psoriasis also have a higher risk of celiac disease. Few studies have evaluated the association of multiple sclerosis with psoriasis, and the relationship has been questioned. Psoriasis has been associated with a 16% increase in overall relative risk for non-skin cancer. People with psoriasis have a 52% increased risk cancers of the lung and bronchus, a 205% increase in the risk of developing cancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract, a 31% increase in the risk of developing cancers of the urinary tract, a 90% increase in the risk of developing liver cancer, and a 46% increase in the risk of developing pancreatic cancer. The risk for development of non-melanoma skin cancers is also increased. Psoriasis increases the risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma of the skin by 431% and increases the risk of basal cell carcinoma by 100%. There is no increased risk of melanoma associated with psoriasis.

Passage 1:In Brisbane they soon became known for their unique shows, experimentation and friendliness. After some initial hardships, McSweeney soon found like-minded musicians in Josh Engelking (percussion), Bo Whitton (bass guitar), Ellen Stancombe (violin) and Wayne Jennings (cello). The newly formed lineup soon released the \"Rain\" single. Based on the single and performances, McSweeney soon began to feature heavily in local media, becoming known for his revolutionary views on music, eccentric interviews/performances and the influence of his colour synesthesia on his music and art. In 2006 the band conducted two extensive national tours, including sets at the coveted Livid and Big Day Out festivals. Following this success, a live performance was recorded with Brisbane community radio station 4ZZZ FM and was released in 2004 as the album The Virgin Mary Australian Tour Acoustic/Strings Album, which received yet more positive feedback. They also headlined the 2004 Valley Fiesta, and played support for Australian singer\u2013songwriter Missy Higgins. 2005 saw the band conduct a two-week tour of China, and release the Walls EP with Modern Music/Sony BMG to critical acclaim. The EP received high rotation play on the national Triple J radio station and generated plenty of new fans. The title track, \"Walls\", entered the stations \"Net 50\" chart at #3 and charted for fifteen weeks. Sometime around this release bass player Bo Whitton left the band and was replaced by Amanda Holmes.\n Passage 2:Other examples of mostly locally generated historical markers in the United States include the plaque outside the Alaska Governor's Mansion made by the Alaska Centennial Commission's historical markers program, the historical markers of State Historic Marker Council in Florida, the markers placed by various agencies in Georgia (of which one source mentions 3,292 different historical markers), in Indiana, where it is illegal to create a historical marker in the \"state format\" without first getting official approval from that state's historical bureau, historical markers in Kansas erected by the Kansas Historical Society and the Kansas Department of Transportation, the Roadside Historic Marker Program in Maryland administered by the Maryland Historical Trust, the State Historic Marker Program of New York (begun in 1926 to commemorate the Sequicentennial of the American Revolution), the historic markers placed as recently as 2008 in Sussex County, New Jersey, the New Mexico historical markers printed in white letters on a brown background by the New Mexico Department of Transportation, the historical markers of North Carolina (the Historical Publications Section of the state Office of Archives and History publishes a Guide to North Carolina Highway Historical Markers), the more than 1200 historical markers of Ohio (all of which are now made in a Marietta, Ohio workshop), and over 550 official state markers in Wisconsin.\n Passage 3:Born in New York City, New York on July 11, 1923, the son of United States Secretary of War Robert P.

Passage 1:Grandjean was awarded the Commander's Cross of the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur in 1804 and elevated in rank to general of division in 1805. During the War of the Fourth Coalition he led a division at Stralsund and Kolberg. Transferring to Spain he fought at the First and Second Sieges of Zaragoza in 1808\u201309. Later that year he led a division at the Battle of Wagram. Grandjean and his division participated in the 1812 French invasion of Russia after which they were besieged and captured at Danzig in 1813. He rallied to Napoleon during the Hundred Days and was placed on the inactive list. In 1821 he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies. His surname is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe, on Column 16.\n Passage 2:The fame of Flavigny was due partly to the relics which it preserved, and partly to the piety of its monks. The monastery was at the height of its reputation in the eighth century, in the time of the Abbot Manasses, who was appointed by Pippin the Short. In 760/62, Manasses attended the council of Attigny. Pippin's successor, Charlemagne, authorized Manasses to found the Carolingian style monastery of Corbigny. The same Manasses transferred from Volvic to Flavigny the relics of Saint Praejectus. Abbot Apollinaris, appointed by Charlemagne in 802, was also abbot of Saint-B\u00e9nigne de Dijon and M\u00f4utier-Saint-Jean. Charlemagne's son, Louis the Pious, used Abbot Adrevaldus as an envoy to Septimania in 834 and 838, according to the Historia Hludowici imperatoris. However, these dates do not correspond to those given in the abbey's only list, which says that Adrevaldus became abbot in 839 and ruled for three years. Eygilo, the founder of Pr\u00fcm Abbey, left his own establishment to become abbot of Flavigny in 860. He set up monks at Corbigny, but later left Flavigny when he was appointed Archbishop of Sens. His successor, Geylo, resigned to become abbot of Tournus and was later appointed bishop of Langres.\n Passage 3:Finley's early recordings featured her ranting provocative monologues over disco beats (and she would often perform her songs late night at Danceteria, where she worked).

She collaborated with Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor on a remix of O'Connor's song \"Jump in the River,\" and was prominently sampled by S'Express on the classic dance floor cut-up, \"Theme from S-Express\" (her vocal - sampled from \"Tales of Taboo\" - exclaimed, \"Drop that ghettoblaster!\"). She was notably one of the NEA Four, four performance artists whose grants from the National Endowment for the Arts were vetoed in 1990 by John Frohnmayer after the process was condemned by Senator Jesse Helms under \"decency\" issues.

As a child, he attended the international bilingual school (French/English). He graduated from Sciences-Po, majoring in Public Administration. During his studies at Sciences-Po, he interned at the French Foreign Ministry and at the French Ministry of Finance. In 1993, he immigrated to Israel and subsequently hebraized his last name to Navon. In Israel, Navon enrolled in the Israel Defense Forces and pursued his graduate studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, earning a master's degree and a Ph.D. in international relations. During his studies at the Hebrew University, he consulted to the Israeli Foreign Ministry on the reform of the United Nations and joined the Shalem Center as a doctoral fellow.\n Passage 2:During the Morean War, monastery was in peril twice. Apparently, during the first plunder of Cetinje, after the Battle of Vrtijeljka, the forces of S\u00fcleyman Bushati did not gravely damage the monastery. Their idea was to pacify Montenegrins, and prevent them from aiding Venetian war effort. On the other hand, his army comprised a considerable amount of forcibly mobilised Christians, and he was afraid of mutiny. The popular tale has it that expeditionary force did start to rob the monastery, however, as one of the soldiers was trying to take down a cross from the top of the roof, he was struck by lightning, which was immediately perceived as Gods sign. In 1689, the Venetians were invited to take control of Cetinje. As they arrived, they quickly fortified themselves in the monastery and in the nearby former court of Crnojevi\u0107. It thus served as a garrison for three years, when Cetinje was attacked again by Suleyman on 25 September 1692. Instead of fighting, Venetians entered negotiations, and reached an agreement to abandon the monastery under honorable terms. However, they mined a monastery with a time bomb, which set of in the evening hours, right after Venetians retreated and as the Ottomans were victoriously entering the monastery, killing many of them in the process. This resulted in seat of Metropolitanate being moved to Dobrska \u0106elija monastery for some time. Vladika Danilo reestablished it, in 1701 or 1704, across the site of the first location, atop the remains of the court with stone from the old one, and added a tablet with the coat of arms of the Crnojevi\u0107 family, and a dedication to Ivan Crnojevi\u0107. Before 1714, it was burnt, and then it was reconstructed yet again around 1743 by Metropolitan Sava Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161. It was the center of spiritual, cultural and political life of the Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro. Its importance is clearly emphasised in Prince-Bishop Vasilije's exaggerated claim, written in his \"History of Montenegro\", that ... before its destruction, Cetinje Monastery was among the most beautiful monasteries in Europe. The last time monastery was devastated was in 1785, when Mahmud Pasha Bushati sacked Cetinje. Ultimately defeated in the Battle of Krusi, his severed head is since then kept as a relic in the monastery. It has been built on several times, the current appearance dates to 1927. The original site of the monastery, known as \u0106ipur (after Greek word \u039a\u03ae\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 - Garden) was used in 1886 by Prince Nicholas of Montenegro for his Court church. The position of the newly built church follows the lineup of the original one from inside the monastery complex. Today its ruin along with couple of pillars can be seen.\n Passage 3:Other programming on WKBF included a late-night weekend horror movie showcase hosted by Ron Sweed, whose on-air character was named The Ghoul. The Ghoul character was essentially a beatnik vampire, outfitted in a fright wig, goatee, lab coat, and a pair of sunglasses with one lens missing. It was patterned after the Ghoulardi character that was created by Ernie Anderson (with his permission), who was later to become the voice of the ABC network in the 1970s. While Anderson had no interest in doing so, he granted Sweed permission to don the costume. As WJW owned the rights to the name \"Ghoulardi\", the younger performer adopted the name \"The Ghoul.\" Although WKBF has long since passed into broadcasting history, Sweed continued to make personal appearances on a fee-for-service basis in this guise until very late in life. WKBF also featured sports programming such as game telecasts from the World Football League and Cincinnati Royals NBA basketball, and harness racing.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

It was accepted into service with the Bundeswehr in 1997, replacing the G3. The G36 is gas-operated and feeds from a 30-round detachable box magazine or 100-round C-Mag drum magazine. The G36 was made with the extensive use of lightweight, corrosion-resistant synthetic materials in its design; the receiver housing, stock, trigger group (including the fire control selector and firing mechanism parts), magazine well, handguard and carry handle are all made of a carbon fiber-reinforced polyamide. The receiver has an integrated steel barrel trunnion (with locking recesses) and a nylon 66 steel reinforced receiver. The standard German Army versions of the G36 are equipped with unique a ZF 3\u00d74\u00b0 dual optical sight that combines a 3\u00d7 magnified telescopic sight and an unmagnified reflex sight mounted on top of the telescopic sight.

They began to feud with the Body Donnas with Phineas having a crush on Sunny and signed her as their manager. They would beat the Body Donnas for the WWF Tag Team Championships. Eventually Sunny turned on them costing them their titles. The Godwinns feuded with the now heel Smoking Gunns, in losing efforts. In 1997, the Godwinns began a heel turn dropping Hillbilly Jim as a manager and picking up Uncle Cletus. The Godwinns quickly won the tag titles a second time from The Headbangers and began a heated feud with the Legion of Doom, which saw the team attempt to break Road Warrior Hawk's neck.

Passage 1:In 1994, one of their singles, \"Fear of the Dark\", received a Grammy nomination for Best Metal Performance. Seven years later, the band were nominated again in that category, with the song \"The Wicker Man\". In 2011, Iron Maiden won the award with \"El Dorado\". In 2002, they won the Ivor Novello Award for international achievement. Iron Maiden received a nomination from the Kerrang! Awards in the \"Best Live Act\" category in 2003, and were inducted into the Kerrang! Hall of Fame two years later. At the 2006 Metal Storm Awards, A Matter of Life and Death was named the best heavy metal album of the year. Iron Maiden have also received nine awards from fourteen nominations at the Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards. Their mascot Eddie, who has previously been used by US critics to argue that Iron Maiden are Satanists, received a Golden Gods nomination in 2006, losing to singer Cristina Scabbia; but was awarded in 2008. Later in 2008, Iron Maiden were nominated in the Best Live Return category at the Vodafone Live Music Awards, to which the band disagreed with their nomination and asked to be withdrawn, stating that they were \"not quite sure where we are returning from.\" They were replaced by the band James. The band were named \"Best British Live Act\" at the 2009 BRIT Awards, winning via a public poll. They were not able to attend the ceremony, ironically due to touring duties, instead delivering an acceptance message by video link-up. Their film  won, in the category \"24 Beats Per Second\", at the SXSW film Festival, held in Austin, Texas, in March 2009. Overall, Iron Maiden have received twenty-nine awards from thirty-nine nominations.\n Passage 2:Ware grew up in the Galveston, Texas region, hoping to play football at the University of Texas. He said \"I was going to Texas. All they had to do was lie to me and tell me I was going to play quarterback once I got there. Thank goodness they told me the truth [that] they were going to move me to defense\". After graduating from Dickinson High School, Ware instead played at the University of Houston, where he won the Heisman Trophy in 1989, along with the Davey O'Brien Award, the latter award given to the most outstanding college quarterback of the year. That year, his junior year, he threw for 4,699 yards, 44 touchdowns, and set 26 NCAA records. Many of the records were thanks to the innovative use of the run and shoot offense, which his successor, David Klingler, also used to great effect. The Cougars ended the season ranked the #14 team in the nation by the Associated Press. He then declared for the NFL Draft, foregoing his senior year.\n Passage 3:Berg was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and expressed an interest in football at an early age. At one point, she played quarterback on a local team that included future Oklahoma Sooners head football coach Bud Wilkinson. At the age of 13, Berg took up golf in 1931 at the suggestion of her parents; by 1934, she began her amateur career and won the Minneapolis City Championship. The following year, Berg claimed a state amateur title. She attended the University of Minnesota where she was a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority. She came to national attention by reaching the final of the 1935 U.S. Women's Amateur, losing to Glenna Collett-Vare in Vare's final Amateur victory. Berg won the Titleholders in 1937. In 1938, she won the U.S. Women's Amateur at Westmoreland and the Women's Western Amateur. With a victory in the 1938 Titleholders Championship and a spot on the winning Curtis Cup team as well, Berg was selected as the Associated Press Woman Athlete of the Year, the first of three times she earned the honor. In 1939, Berg won her third consecutive Titleholders, although she was unable to compete in the U.S. Women's Amateur due to an operation on her appendix.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:The fire originated as a controlled burn that was part of the 10-year Bandelier National Monument plan for reducing fire hazard within the monument. The starting point was high on Cerro Grande, a 10,200-foot (3110-m) summit on the rim of the Valles Caldera not far north of New Mexico State Road 4, the main highway through Los Alamos County. Like many mountains in the Jemez, Cerro Grande was mainly covered with coniferous forest, composed largely of Ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, white fir, and aspen trees, with a characteristic rincon (meadow) on its southern slopes near the summit. This grassy area also represented the headwaters of Frijoles Creek (Rito de los Frijoles), which flows southeast into Frijoles Canyon and on to the Rio Grande, passing en route the main tourist areas at Bandelier. The plan for the burn (see the NPS summary below) called for initial ignition (\"phase 1\") to be in the rincon, followed by flanking fires (\"phase 2\") along the slightly higher country east and west of Frijoles Creek. Ignition of the phase-1 burn was scheduled for May 4, 2000.\n Passage 2:In the 2007 off-season, Lucic signed an entry-level contract with the Bruins on August 2. He had been chosen as the Giants' next team captain, but made the Bruins' 2007\u201308 opening roster out of training camp. He played in his first career NHL game on October 5, 2007, a 4\u20131 loss to the Dallas Stars, in which he fought opposing forward Brad Winchester. His first goal came a week later on October 12 against Jonathan Bernier, a game winner, in an 8\u20136 win against the Los Angeles Kings. By also fighting Kings forward Raitis Ivan\u0101ns and notching an assist, he recorded a Gordie Howe hat trick (an unofficial statistic constituting a goal, an assist and a fight in one game). Unsure of whether the Bruins would keep him or return him to junior, he stayed in a downtown hotel in Boston to start the season. However, Lucic made enough of an impression during his first set of games with the Bruins, showing grit and consistent willingness to fight (he recorded 13 fighting majors in his rookie season), that they decided to keep him in the lineup. Bruins management informed the Giants prior to Lucic's tenth game, accounting for the NHL's nine-game maximum for junior-eligible players to stay with their NHL club without initiating their contract. He was chosen to participate in the 2008 NHL YoungStars Game and finished his rookie campaign with eight goals and 27 points. Towards the end of the season, he was voted by Bruins fans for the team's Seventh Player Award for exceeding expectations. Matched up against the first-seeded Montreal Canadiens in the opening round, Lucic scored his first Stanley Cup playoff goal in Game 3 on April 13, 2008. He finished his first NHL post-season with two goals as the Bruins were eliminated by the Canadiens in seven games.\n Passage 3:Watson graduated in 1943 with BS in electrical engineering from Iowa State College. From 1943 to 1946 he was a researcher at the United States Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C. During his work for the U.S. Navy he went to night school at George Washington University. He graduated from the University of Iowa with Ph.D. in 1948 with thesis The polarizability of the meson-charge cloud of a neutron in an external electrostatic field. He was from 1948 to 1949 an Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study and from 1949 to 1951 an AEC Fellow at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. He was from 1951 to 1954 an assistant professor of physics at Indiana University and from 1954 to 1957 an associate professor of physics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. In 1953 he was elected a fellow of the American Physical Society. From 1957 to 1981 he was a staff member of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, as well as a professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1974 he was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences.

Kirsch unsuccessfully challenged Forever Hooligans (Alex Koslov and Rocky Romero) for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship at a Sacramento Wrestling Federation (SWF) event in Gridley, California. Following the match, Kushida saved Shelley from a beatdown at the hands of Koslov and Romero. Shelley and Kushida began forming the tag team \"Time Splitters\" and scoring several wins over Koslov and Romero in multiple man teamed matches, after debuting their new double-team finishing maneuver, the I-94. On October 8 at King of Pro-Wrestling, Time Splitters unsuccessfully challenged Forever Hooligans for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. On October 21, the Time Splitters entered the 2012 Super Jr. Tag Tournament, defeating Jado & Gedo in their first round match. On November 2, Shelley and Kushida defeated Suzuki-gun (Taichi and Taka Michinoku) to advance to the finals, where, later that same day, they defeated Apollo 55 to win the tournament and become the number one contenders to the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. On November 11 at Power Struggle, the Time Splitters defeated Forever Hooligans in a rematch to win the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. Time Splitters made their first successful title defense on February 10, 2013, at The New Beginning, defeating Forever Hooligans in the third title match between the two teams. Their second successful defense took place on March 3 at New Japan's 41st anniversary event, where they defeated Jyushin Thunder Liger and Tiger Mask. On April 5, Shelley received his first shot at the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship, but was defeated by the defending champion, Prince Devitt. Two days later at Invasion Attack, Time Splitters defeated Devitt and Ryusuke Taguchi for their third successful defense of the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. On May 3 at Wrestling Dontaku 2013, Time Splitters lost the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship back to the Forever Hooligans in their fourth defense.\n Passage 2:When Seattle decided to try to put itself on the map with the futuristic Century 21 Exposition \u2014 the 1962 World's Fair \u2014 high culture was on the agenda, as well as popular entertainment along the lines of \"Gracie Hansen's Paradise International\" and \"Les Poupees de Paris,\" an adult-themed puppet show, both of which aspired more to a Gay Nineties naughtiness than to anything artistic. The Opera House on the grounds of the center was rebuilt for the occasion (and would be rebuilt again 2001\u20132003 as McCaw Hall); performers at the fair included Igor Stravinsky, Benny Goodman, and Victor Borge; the Seattle Symphony brought in opera singers and staged Aida. The Fine Arts Pavilion (later the Exhibition Hall) managed to bring in works by Titian, Van Dyck, and Monet, as well as more contemporary pieces by Jackson Pollock, Georgia O'Keeffe, and Alexander Calder and by Pacific Northwest artists Tobey, Callahan, and Graves. There was also a significant exhibition of Asian art and Northwest Coast Indian art. The exposition also commissioned a massive abstract mural by Horiuchi, which still forms the backdrop to the stage at Seattle Center's Mural Amphitheater.\n Passage 3:The Colony of Vancouver Island had been created in 1849 to bolster British claims to the whole island and the adjacent Gulf Islands, and to provide a North Pacific home port for the Royal Navy at Esquimalt. By the mid-1850s, the Island Colony's non-indigenous population was around 800 people; a mix of mostly British, French-Canadian, Metis, Hawaiians, but with handfuls of Iroquoians and Cree in the employ of the fur company, and a few Belgian and French Oblate priests (thousands of First Nations died due to the smallpox epidemic). Three years earlier, the Treaty of Washington had established the boundary between British North America and the United States of America west of the Rocky Mountains along the 49th parallel. The mainland area of present-day British Columbia, Canada was an unorganised territory under British sovereignty until 1858. The region was under the de facto administration of the Hudson's Bay Company, and its regional chief executive, James Douglas, who also happened to be Governor of Vancouver Island. The region was informally given the name New Caledonia, after the fur-trading district which covered the central and northern interior of the mainland west of the Rockies.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

In that same year Sheffield Lab released \"I've Got the Music in Me\" a Direct to disc recording by Thelma Houston and Pressure Cooker that went on to become a benchmark vinyl recording for audiophiles. The following year she recorded songs for the soundtrack of the film The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars & Motor Kings starring Billy Dee Williams and James Earl Jones. In 1975 Houston appeared on the Golden Globe Award broadcast performing the nominated song \"On & On\" and also was featured in a tribute to Berry Gordy on that year's American Music Award broadcast singing \"You've Made Me So Very Happy\". That year Houston's version of \"Do You Know Where You're Going To\" was being set for single release when it was pulled and the song given to Diana Ross to serve as the theme song for the movie Mahogany. In 1976 Houston sang backing vocals for Motown labelmate Jermaine Jackson on his album My Name Is Jermaine.\n Passage 3:The Annals begin with a universal history from the creation of the world until about 1040. This portion of the work is drawn largely from other, earlier annalistic works, particularly those of Saint Bede, Isidore of Seville, and from German traditions like the Annals of Quedlinburg and Weissenburg. From about the date of 1042 onwards, however, the account is Lampert's own and he carries the history from there up to the year 1077, when the Swabian duke Rudolf of Rheinfelden was crowned anti-king by the dissident princes. Lambert's Annales are among the most important sources available for the reign of King Henry IV, the Investiture Controversy, and the Saxon Rebellion in 1073\u201375. Among the significant events detailed in Lampert's history are the infamous Coup of Kaiserswerth in 1062, Henry's famous Walk to Canossa where he submitted (albeit temporarily) to Pope Gregory VII, and the 1075 Battle of Langensalza where Henry's forces defeated the Saxon and Thuringian rebels. Lambert ended his work with the election of anti-king Rudolf of Swabia, stating that his own account had reached an appropriate conclusion and that another writer would be able to pick up from where he left off in chronicling this new era for the German kingdom (Rudolf was mortally wounded in the Battle on the Elster against Henry's forces in 1080).\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

He earned an MSc in plant pathology from Macdonald Campus of McGill University a year later. A doctoral degree he started at the University of Toronto in 1929 was abandoned due to the Great Depression. He established a herbarium of mycological specimens where he was employed for many years at the Kentville Research Station (now the Atlantic Food and Horticulture Research Centre); most of his collections are now housed at the Canadian National Mycological Herbarium. His early research concerned the fungal infestation of plants, such as that of Colletotrichum lindemuthianum on beans (Phaseolus).

His legal career there began prosperously\u2014he was employed by the Privy Council to examine witnesses\u2014but was hampered later by his representation of the Puritans, a religious tendency which did not conform with the established Church of England. Fuller was repeatedly in contention with the ecclesiastical courts, including the Star Chamber and Court of High Commission, and was once expelled for the zeal with which he defended his client. In 1593 he was returned as the Member of Parliament for St Mawes, where he campaigned against the extension of recusancy laws. Outside of Parliament, he successfully brought a patents case which not only undermined the right of the Crown to issue patents but accurately predicted the attitude taken by the Statute of Monopolies two decades later.\n Passage 2:The 23 Special Wards of Tokyo were formerly Tokyo City.

It is the first full season under manager John Askey and new owners Carol and Kevin Shanahan. The season covers the period from 1 July 2019 through to 30 June 2020. Askey reshaped the squad by letting 14 players go and bringing in 14 new signings, though David Amoo was the only new player in the starting eleven for the opening game of the season. They lost just one league game in six matches in August, though this was a heavy 5\u20132 defeat at Grimsby Town, and they also exited the EFL Cup at the first round.

When the body receives sensory information, the sympathetic nervous system sends a signal to preganglionic nerve fibers, which activate the adrenal medulla through acetylcholine. Once activated, norepinephrine and epinephrine are released directly into the blood by postganglionic nerve fibers where they act as the bodily mechanism for \"fight-or-flight\" responses. Because of this, the sympathoadrenal system plays a large role in maintaining glucose levels, sodium levels, blood pressure, and various other metabolic pathways that couple with bodily responses to the environment. During numerous diseased states, such as hypoglycemia or even stress, the body's metabolic processes are skewed. The sympathoadrenal system works to return the body to homeostasis through the activation or inactivation of the adrenal gland. However, more severe disorders of the sympathoadrenal system such as phaeochromocytoma (a tumor on the adrenal medulla) can affect the body's ability to maintain a homeostatic state. In such cases, curative agents such as adrenergic agonists and antagonists are used to modify epinephrine and norepinephrine levels released by the adrenal medulla.\n Passage 3:Petraeus graduated from West Point in 1974. He earned the General George C.

Despite her blindness, she learned to play piano at age three. As a child, she sang in the church choir and at talent contests, and at age seventeen, she opened for Bill Anderson. Her parents wanted her to be treated no differently from sighted people and she was sent to public school, graduating from Butler High School in Augusta in 1972. She performed in and around the Augusta area and eventually, she met Chet Atkins, who advised her to move to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a country music career, which she did at age eighteen. After failing to find a record deal, she returned to Miami and joined a band called Sound Dimension. She continued to perform locally, later forming a band called the Terri Gibbs Trio, which performed at a Steak and Ale in Augusta, Georgia. Gibbs then sent a demo tape to record producer Ed Penney of MCA Records, signing to the label in 1980. Penney was a former Boston disc jockey and a long-time songwriter.

Mannerheim was appointed the military chief of the Whites. Twenty years later, when Finland was twice at war with the Soviet Union from November 1939 until September 1944, Mannerheim successfully led the defence of Finland as commander-in-chief of the country's armed forces. In 1944, when the prospect of Germany's defeat in World War II became clear, Mannerheim was elected President of Finland and oversaw peace negotiations with the Soviet Union and the UK.

His maternal grandfather Harold Macmillan was Prime Minister at the time of his birth. His grandmother, Lady Dorothy Cavendish, was descended from three Prime Ministers, the 4th Duke of Devonshire (1756\u20131757), the 2nd Earl of Shelburne (1782-1783) and the 3rd Duke of Portland (1783 and 1807\u20131809), related by marriage to President John F.

His cousin Andrew Cavendish, 11th Duke of Devonshire was married to Deborah Mitford. His uncle Maurice Macmillan was a leading figure of Edward Heath's 1970s government.\n Passage 2:The Treaty of Lutatius officially ended the First Punic War. It received its name from Gaius Lutatius Catulus, the Roman consul and victor of the Battle of the Aegates Islands who negotiated it with a subordinate of Hamilcar Barca in 241 BC. According to the historian Polybius, the terms of the accord dictated that Carthage must evacuate Sicily, not make war upon Syracuse or its allies, hand over all prisoners taken during the war, and pay an indemnity of 2200 talents (66 tons) of silver in 20 annual installments. Originally rejected by the Roman people, these terms were eventually adopted with very little change under the authority of Quintus Lutatius Cerco, the brother of Gaius Lutatius Catulus. In the final agreement, Carthage was only given ten years to pay an indemnity of 3200 talents (96 tons), and had to evacuate the islands between Sicily and Italy (Ustica and the Aeolian Islands) and Aegadian Islands off western coast of Sicily.\n Passage 3:All of SR 198 was added to the state highway system in the three bond issues floated to pay for the construction of the system. The first bond issue, approved by the state's voters in 1910, included the road from Visalia west to Hanford, connecting the two county seats with the central north\u2013south highway (Route 4, now SR 99). As part of the 1916 bond issue, the route was extended west from Hanford through Coalinga to the coast trunk highway (Route 2, now US 101) near San Lucas, and assigned it the Route 10 designation. The third bond issue, passed in 1919, included a further extension east from Visalia to Sequoia National Park. The entire length of Route 10 was marked as Sign Route 198 in 1934, and this number was adopted legislatively in the 1964 renumbering. The portion east of Interstate 5 near Coalinga was added to the California Freeway and Expressway System in 1959, and parts of it have been built as such. The construction of the freeway east of Visalia to Road 192 was approved in January 1961, with the remainder of the freeway unplanned at that time as contingent on the routing of SR 65. The projected cost in 1958 of the entire freeway east of Visalia was $13\u00a0million (equivalent to $ in ) and was scheduled to be completed by 1964. The freeway through Visalia was completed by 1965, with an expressway connecting it to US 99. Also completed was the expressway heading west out of Hanford, with part of it access-controlled west of Lemoore.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

They wrote illegal anti-war pamphlets pseudonymously signed Spartacus after the slave-liberating Thracian gladiator who opposed the Romans. Luxemburg's pseudonym was Junius, after Lucius Junius Brutus, founder of the Roman Republic. The Spartacus League vehemently rejected the SPD's support in the Reichstag for funding the war, and sought to lead Germany's proletariat towards an anti-war general strike. As a result, Luxemburg and Liebknecht were imprisoned in June 1916 for two and a half years. During imprisonment, Luxemburg was twice relocated, first to Posen (now Pozna\u0144), then to Breslau (now Wroc\u0142aw). smuggled out and illegally published her articles. Among them was The Russian Revolution, criticising the Bolsheviks, presciently warning of their dictatorship. Nonetheless, she continued to call for a \"dictatorship of the proletariat\", albeit not of the one party Bolshevik model. In that context, she wrote the words \"Freiheit ist immer die Freiheit des Andersdenkenden\" (\"Freedom is always the freedom of the one who thinks differently\") and continues in the same chapter: \"The public life of countries with limited freedom is so poverty-stricken, so miserable, so rigid, so unfruitful, precisely because, through the exclusion of democracy, it cuts off the living sources of all spiritual riches and progress\". Another article written in April 1915 when in prison and published and distributed illegally in June 1916 originally under the pseudonym Junius was Die Krise der Sozialdemokratie (The Crisis of Social Democracy), also known as the Junius-Brosch\u00fcre or The Junius Pamphlet.\n Passage 3:Guttenberg was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Ann Iris (n\u00e9e Newman), a surgical assistant, and Jerome Stanley Guttenberg, an electrical engineer.

Passage 1:In 2011, they released a cover of Jay-Z's and Kanye West's \"Otis\" which helped them rise to fame. The video reached five million views in its first five days of being uploaded to YouTube. However, with much pressure received from Jay-Z's legal team the video was removed from the duo's profile. Undeterred by the controversy, they released a cover of Drake and Lil Wayne's \"The Motto\", launched their own clothing line called Play Dirty and early into 2012 were invited to join the British rapper Skepta on his tour in the UK. They appeared on Tinie Tempah's 2011 mixtape Happy Birthday and in 2013 they released their third mixtape Young Kingz, with features from Chip, Tinie Tempah, G FrSH, Giggs, George the Poet, Yungen, Ari, Yana Toma, Fekky, Siah and Anthony Thomas.

Tinie Tempah also freestyled over the beat on Charlie Sloth's Fire in the Booth.\n Passage 2:More than 300 Roman Catholics were put to death by English governments between 1535 and 1681 for treason, thus for secular rather than religious offenses. In 1570, Pope Pius V issued his papal bull Regnans in Excelsis, which absolved Catholics from their obligations to the government. This dramatically worsened the situation of the Catholics in England. English governments continued to fear the fictitious Popish Plot. The 1584 Parliament of England, declared in \"An Act against Jesuits, seminary priests, and such other like disobedient persons\" that the purpose of Jesuit missionaries who had come to Britain was \"to stir up and move sedition, rebellion and open hostility\". Consequently, Jesuit priests like Saint John Ogilvie were hanged. This somehow contrasts with the image of the Elizabethan era as the time of William Shakespeare, but compared to the antecedent Marian Persecutions there is an important difference to consider. Mary I of England had been motivated by a religious zeal to purge heresy from her land, and during her short reign from 1553 to 1558 about 290 Protestants had been burned at the stake for heresy, whereas Elizabeth I of England \"acted out of fear for the security of her realm.\"\n Passage 3:The ancient Egyptians began dividing the night into  at some time before the compilation of the Dynasty V Pyramid Texts in the 24thcentury. By 2150 (Dynasty IX), diagrams of stars inside Egyptian coffin lids\u2014variously known as \"diagonal calendars\" or \"star clocks\"\u2014attest that there were exactly 12 of these. Clagett writes that it is \"certain\" this duodecimal division of the night followed the adoption of the Egyptian civil calendar, usually placed on the basis of analyses of the Sothic cycle, but a lunar calendar presumably long predated this and also would have had twelve months in each of its years. The coffin diagrams show that the Egyptians took note of the heliacal risings of 36 stars or constellations (now known as \"decans\"), one for each of the ten-day \"weeks\" of their civil calendar. (12 sets of alternate \"triangle decans\" were used for the 5 epagomenal days between years.) Each night, the rising of eleven of these decans were noted, separating the night into twelve divisions whose middle terms would have lasted about 40minutes each. (Another seven stars were noted by the Egyptians during the twilight and predawn periods, although they were not important for the hour divisions.) The original decans used by the Egyptians would have fallen noticeably out of their proper places over a span of several centuries. By the time of (), the priests at Karnak were using water clocks to determine the hours. These were filled to the brim at sunset and the hour determined by comparing the water level against one of its twelve gauges, one for each month of the year. During the New Kingdom, another system of decans was used, made up of 24 stars over the course of the year and 12 within any one night.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

The first Russian regular regiments consisted of the so-called datochniye lyudi (lifelong conscripts), later combined with the okhochiye lyudi (volunteers). Peter managed to muster 27 regiments formed into three divisions (9 regiments each). Generals Adam Veyde, Avtonom Golovin and Anikita Repnin were appointed commanders of these divisions. Soldiers had to learn how to use weapons and master military formations in accordance with Veyde's Military Charter (1698). Foreign officers were in charge of this training, which caused Golovin's anger. He used to say that they couldn't hold a musket in their hands, didn't know their business, had to be taught themselves, and that it was all a waste of time. Soon, Peter the Great had to decline their services and put inexperienced Muscovite sluzhiliye lyudi in charge of the training. In 1700, Golovin formed 8 infantry regiments and one dragoon regiment (one division). During the Battle of Narva, the Russian army was defeated by Charles XII. Golovin's division (which consisted of recruits only) was one of the first ones to flee the battlefield. Field Marshal Charles Eug\u00e8ne de Cro\u00ff and all of the foreign officers in the Russian army surrendered to the Swedes. They were soon followed by Generals Yakov Dolgoruky, tsarevich Alexander Imeretinsky, Avtonom Golovin and Ivan Buturlin, who had decided to capitulate, as well. As a result, almost all of the commanding officers were taken prisoners and the Swedes captured all of the Russian artillery, which Peter the Great had been assembling piece by piece from all over Russia. Golovin was taken to Stockholm and remained there for the next 18 years. The tsar was only able to exchange him in 1718. In 1719 and 1720, Golovin took part in the structuralization of the Russian army. \n Passage 2:Nick Payne arrives in town after a shipwreck. Soon, he is romancing Brooke Logan. This eventually puts him at odds with her fianc\u00e9e, Ridge Forrester. Their rivalry is exacerbated when his mother, Jacqueline Payne, reveals to Nick that he is the son of his employer, billionaire shipping magnate Massimo Marone making him Ridge's half-brother. Brooke chooses to marry Ridge. They go on their honeymoon in South America, where Ridge is kidnapped by a group of thugs working for Sheila Carter, a criminal who killed Ridge's wife Taylor Hayes. While saving Ridge, Brooke and Nick end up also being held captive by Sheila, demanding gold from Massimo. Ridge falls into a furnace and is presumed dead. While grieving, Brooke and Nick have sex. It is later revealed that Ridge is alive. Brooke realizes she is pregnant and is unsure if Ridge or Nick is the father.

Nick blackmails Eric Forrester and the rest of the Forresters into selling him Forrester Creations or Stephanie will face charges. Brooke, furious at Nick's treatment of the Forresters, sells him her stock as well, ends her marriage to Nick and returns to Ridge.\n Passage 3:The death of his father, Dom Luiz de Mello, drove him early to soldiering, and having joined a contingent for the Flanders war, he found himself in the historic storm of January 1627, when the pick of the Portuguese fleet suffered shipwreck in the Bay of Biscay. He spent much of the next ten years of his life in military routine work in the Iberian Peninsula, varied by visits to the court of Madrid, where he contracted a friendship with the Spanish poet Quevedo and earned the favor of the powerful minister Olivares. In 1637 the latter despatched him in company with the conde de Linhares on a mission to pacify the revolted city of \u00c9vora, and on the same occasion the duke of Braganza, afterwards King John IV (for whom he acted as confidential agent at Madrid), employed him to satisfy Philip III of Portugal of his loyalty to the Philippine Dynasty.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:Owing to Gaunt's influence, he was chosen in January 1376/7, in the last of Edward III's parliaments (the Bad Parliament), to act as Speaker of the House of Commons. According to the Rolls of Parliament (ii. 374) Hungerford \"avait les paroles pur les communes d'Angleterre en cet parliament\" ('[he] spoke for the commons of England in said Parliament'). He is thus the first person formally mentioned in the Rolls of Parliament as holding the office of speaker. Sir Peter de la Mare preceded him in the post, without the title, in the Good Parliament of 1376. In 1380 Hungerford was appointed Forester of Selwood. In 1369 he purchased from Walter Pavely, de jure Baron Burghersh, the manor of Farleigh Montfort, now called Farleigh Hungerford, which served as the chief residence of his descendants, and in 1383 obtained licence to crenellate his manor house there, which thus became Farleigh Castle. In about 1384 he aroused the suspicion of King Richard II, who attached him, but he obtained a pardon and also a confirmation of his free warren at Farleigh.\n Passage 2:The maritime fur trade brought the Pacific Northwest coast into a vast, new international trade network, centered on the north Pacific Ocean, global in scope, and based on capitalism, but not, for the most part, on colonialism. A triangular trade network emerged linking the Pacific Northwest coast, China, the Hawaiian Islands (only recently discovered by the Western world), Britain, and the United States (especially New England). The trade had a major effect on the indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest coast, especially the Aleut, Sugpiaq, Tlingit, Haida, Nuu-chah-nulth, and Chinook peoples. A rapid increase of wealth occurred among the Northwest Coast natives, along with increased warfare, potlatching, slaving, and depopulation due to epidemic disease. However, the indigenous culture was not overwhelmed by rapid change, but actually flourished. For instance, the importance of totems and traditional nobility crests increased, and the Chinook Jargon, which remains a distinctive aspect of Pacific Northwest culture, was developed during this era. Native Hawaiian society was similarly affected by the sudden influx of Western wealth and technology, as well as epidemic diseases. The trade's effect on China and Europe was minimal, but for New England, the maritime fur trade and the significant profits it made helped revitalize the region, contributing to its transformation from an agrarian to an industrial society. The wealth generated by the maritime fur trade was invested in industrial development, especially textile manufacturing. \n Passage 3:Tashawaylennahan was born around 1690 in New Jersey and was a translator and guide for the early settlers of New Jersey and Pennsylvania in the early 18th century. He lived near what is now Stockertown, Pennsylvania and Forks Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania, north of Easton, Pennsylvania in the Lehigh Valley, along the Delaware River. He moved from New Jersey as early as 1733. The Lenape were displaced from their land by the Walking Purchase, but on April 28, 1738 Tatamy was given by John, Thomas and Richard Penn, the descendants of William Penn. Worried that he would be displaced from his land, he formally purchased it in 1741 for 48 pounds, 16 shillings, and 5 pence. This made him the first native-born individual to make a formal purchase of land in Pennsylvania. After the Native Americans were forced to leave the Lehigh Valley, Tatamy petitioned the Pennsylvania Provincial Council for the right to remain on his land. In 1745, Tatamy was the first Native American baptized by David Brainerd. He died in 1760 and around 1780, Tatamy's neighbors, Henry and Matthias Stecher, claimed the property, and transferred it to William Allen. Tatamy's widow was listed on the 1790 United States Census.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Her salon was famous and she was one of the originators of the Greek Revival Directoire style women's fashions of the French Directory period. She was a very colorful figure; one story is that she was said to bathe in the juice of strawberries for their healing properties. She once arrived at the Tuileries Palace, then the chief residence of Napoleon Bonaparte, supported by a black page, with eight sapphire rings and six toe rings, a gold bracelet on each ankle and nine bracelets on each arm. To top the look off Theresa had a head band covered in rubies. On another occasion she appeared at the Paris Opera wearing a white silk dress without sleeves and not wearing any underwear. Talleyrand commented: \"Il n'est pas possible de s'exposer plus somptueusement!\" (\"One could not be more sumptuously unclothed!\").\n Passage 2:In 1963-1964 Walker was a resident artist at the Oldenburgisches Staatstheater. He then became a resident artist at the Cologne Opera from 1964-1966. Other contracts soon followed with such companies as the Cincinnati Opera, the Houston Grand Opera, the Lyric Opera of Kansas City, the Miami Opera, and the New Orleans Opera among others. In 1971 he created the role of Jonathan Gilourin in the world premiere of Dominick Argento\u2019s Colonel Jonathan the Saint at the Denver Lyric Opera. In 1974 he was handpicked by Sir Georg Solti to sing the role of the Evangelist in Bach's St Matthew Passion with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (CSO). He returned twice more for performances with Solti and the CSO for performances of the Shepherd in Stravinsky's Oedipus Rex (1976) and Beethoven's Missa Solemnis (1977); the latter of which was recorded for London Records.\n Passage 3:During the French Revolutionary Wars the Royal Navy had exerted dominance at sea over its continental rivals, most immediately the French Navy with its principal fleet based at Brest on the Breton coast of the Bay of Biscay. To contain this fleet the British practiced a close blockade strategy; maintaining a fleet off Brest whenever weather conditions permitted to prevent the French fleet from breaking out into the Atlantic Ocean. This blockade force also limited French trade and maritime communications, attacking merchant ships and individual warships seeking to resupply or reinforce the main French fleet. This made French maritime journeys extremely hazardous even in inshore waters: in June 1795 the main French fleet had suffered a defeat at the hands of the blockade force at the Battle of Groix in the approaches to the port of Lorient, while at the Action of 13 January 1797 the independently sailing 74-gun ship of the line Droits de l'Homme was driven ashore and destroyed in the approaches to Brest by two frigates of the blockade squadron.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:Episodes of the show often featured Ed Grimley in several adventures, which start out as mundane, but turn very surreal and cartoonish, interspersed with science lessons from The Amazing Gustav Brothers, Roger and Emil, and a live-action segment with a \"scary story\" titled The Count Floyd Show presented as a show-within-a-show by Grimley's favorite television host, SCTV's Count Floyd (played by SCTV cast member Joe Flaherty). Grimley's fellow cartoon characters included Grimley's landlord Leo Freebus (voiced by Jonathan Winters), Leo's wife Deidre (voiced by Andrea Martin), his ditzy, amateur actress neighbor Ms. Malone (voiced by Catherine O'Hara; a female character by the name of Ms. Malone did appear on an SNL version of an Ed Grimley sketch on the season ten episode hosted by Alex Karras, but Ms. Malone was played by that episode's musical guest Tina Turner), and her little brother Wendell (voiced by Danny Cooksey). Ed owns a goldfish named Moby and a clever pet rat named Sheldon (voiced by Frank Welker). At the end of each episode, Ed would write in his diary about what happened in his day.\n Passage 2:Aronson's mother family came from \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. After the German invasion of Poland in 1939, they first moved from \u0141\u00f3d\u017a to Warsaw. After a few days, they decided to move further east to the Kresy, where near R\u00f3wno their relatives owned some land. However, in the meantime the Soviet Union also invaded Poland as part of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Treaty between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, and the relatives were arrested by the NKVD and deported eastwards, deep within the Soviet Union. As a result, the family tried to unsuccessfully enter Lithuania, and then into Romania. Eventually they wound up in Soviet-occupied Lwow. According to Aronson, in Lwow, the Soviets pressured Poles, Ukrainians and Jews to sign up for the Komsomol but he personally refused.\n Passage 3:Historical negationism applies the techniques of research, quotation, and presentation for deception of the reader and denial of the historical record. In support of the \"revised history\" perspective, the negationist historian uses false documents as genuine sources, presents specious reasons to distrust genuine documents, exploits published opinions, by quoting out of historical context, manipulates statistics, and mistranslates texts in other languages. The revision techniques of historical negationism operate in the intellectual space of public debate for the advancement of a given interpretation of history and the cultural-perspective of the \"revised history\". As a document, the revised history is used to negate the validity of the factual, documentary record, and so reframe explanations and perceptions of the discussed historical event, in order to deceive the reader, the listener, and the viewer; therefore, historical negationism functions as a technique of propaganda. Rather than submit their works for peer review, negationist historians rewrite history and use logical fallacies to construct arguments that will obtain the desired results, a \"revised history\" that supports an agenda\u00a0\u2013 political, ideological, religious, etc. In the practice of historiography, the British historian Richard J. Evans describes the technical differences, between professional historians and negationist historians:\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

In 1841 he was back to Novi, practicing his craft and agriculture, but also engaging in literature and cultural issues in general. In 1847 he ended up in Vienna, in 1848 again in Bosnia (in Sarajevo, at the court of Fazli-pa\u0161a \u0160erifija). At the end of 1848, in a letter addressed to his brothers he says: \"I don't know when I shall return home, for I have been, I'm afraid, created for this country. Turks are very fond of me for my prudence, they say, and rayah grows ever more trust in me, and therefrom there is no other outcome but mitre on the head or a stake in the arse\". After Sarajevo, Matija went to Istanbul (though the exact dates cannot be ascertained), and according to some legends even further, to Suez and the Egypt. In 1852 Matija was back to Novi, where he settled until growing ill in 1879. He lived a secluded life until the symptoms of mind degeneration have started to show, finally dying in the sanatorium of a well-known psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing, near Graz, on April 17, 1881.\n Passage 2:The film begins with a narrated map showing the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, commanded by Robert E. Lee, crossing the Potomac River to invade the North in June 1863, marching across Maryland and into Pennsylvania. On June 30, Confederate spy Henry Thomas Harrison reports to Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, commander of the First Corps, that the Union Army of the Potomac is moving in their direction, and that Union commander Joseph Hooker has been replaced by George Meade. Longstreet reports the information to General Lee, who is concerned that the army is moving \"on the word of an actor\", as opposed to that of his cavalry chief, J. E. B. Stuart. Nonetheless, Lee orders the army to concentrate near the town of Gettysburg. At the Union encampments near Union Mills, Maryland, Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain of the 20th Maine is ordered to take in 120 men from the disbanded 2nd Maine who had resigned in protest, with permission to shoot any man who refuses to fight. Chamberlain speaks to the men, and is able to persuade all but six to take up arms.\n Passage 3:Great Australian Bight Marine National Park is a marine protected area in the Australian state of South Australia located west of the state capital of Adelaide. The national park was proclaimed under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 (SA) by the South Australian Government on 26 September 1996 principally to protect the calving waters of the Southern right whale and the Australian sea lion populations. It consists of two sections occupying the ocean immediately adjoining the coastline up to a distance of and extending from the Western Australia border in the west to a locality known as the Tchalingaby Sandhills in the east.

Bleach was highly influenced by the heavy dirge-rock of the Melvins and Mudhoney, 1980s punk rock, and the 1970s heavy metal of Black Sabbath. Novoselic said in a 2001 interview with Rolling Stone that the band had played a tape in their van while on tour that had an album by The Smithereens on one side and an album by the extreme metal band Celtic Frost on the other, and noted that the combination probably played an influence as well. The money for the recording sessions for Bleach, listed as $606.17 on the album sleeve, was supplied by Jason Everman, who was subsequently brought into the band as the second guitarist. Though Everman did not actually play on the album, he received a credit on Bleach because, according to Novoselic, they \"wanted to make him feel more at home in the band\". Just prior to the album's release, Nirvana insisted on signing an extended contract with Sub Pop, making the band the first to do so with the label.\n Passage 2:The Investigator was Gerry Anderson's first puppet production since The Secret Service (1969), the last Supermarionation series to be made by his former company Century 21 Productions. Having gone on to make the live-action series UFO and The Protectors, neither of which were made specifically for children, Anderson wanted to create something new for the younger audience and devised The Investigator as the template for a new Supermarionation programme, intending to pitch it to American network NBC in the hope that it would commission a series. The pilot was planned by Anderson, his wife Sylvia and their long-time business partner Reg Hill. Written by Sylvia from a story by Shane Rimmer, it was funded by private venture capital and produced by off-the-shelf company Starkits between The Protectors and a planned second series of UFO (which was later made as ).\n Passage 3:Smith began his managerial career with Bury in November 1973, taking over from Allan Brown.

Langston was hired by the National Museum of Canada in 1954 to replace Charles M. Sternberg, and worked in western Canada and on Prince Edward Island until 1962. One of his major finds, with Loris Russell, was the rediscovery of Sternberg's Scabby Butte Pachyrhinosaurus bonebed. Langston, along with a small team of fieldworkers, excavated the Scabby Butte bonebed in 1957, securing several skulls and several hundred bones there. He then went on in 1963 to the University of Texas, where in 1969 he became the second director of the Vertebrate Paleontology Laboratory, where he worked on many projects, including work on Cretaceous vertebrates from Big Bend National Park. Finds that he and his students worked on include the giant pterosaur Quetzalcoatlus and a variety of Permian and Mesozoic reptiles. He retired in 1986, but continued to be active in the field.

Its name is derived from Hibernia, an ancient name for Ireland. James Connolly, the famous socialist and Irish Republican leader, was a Hibs fan, while the club were \"closely identified\" with the Irish Home Rule Movement during the 1880s. There was some sectarian resistance initially to an Irish club participating in Scottish football, but Hibs established themselves as a force in Scottish football in the 1880s.

Although the costs of the Vietnam War and the programs of the Great Society forced cuts to NASA's budget as early as 1965, the first Moon landing occurred in 1969, early in Richard Nixon's presidency. Under the Nixon administration NASA's budget continued to decline and three of the planned Apollo Moon landings were cancelled.

Due to this tight budget, the car, christened the \"Lumpy\", reused Toyota's 3S-GT engine in the 88C Group C specification, which was a 2.1-litre turbocharged straight-four engine, producing ; this engine was coupled to an Xtrac gearbox from a Peugeot Group C car. The chassis tub was designed to be simple but strong, and the bodywork was also simple; the tight budget meant that the LMP never saw a wind tunnel. The bodywork was designed to minimize lift over the upper body of the car, and had much simpler brake cooling than on most Le Mans Prototypes; the radiator ducts were used, via a scoop, to cool the brakes. After the LMP was completed, Tom Kristensen tested it on at least one occasion, whilst project director Andy Thorby recalled it being tested a total of three times; he stated that the car was very reliable, had lower fuel consumption than the 88C Group C car had (with the same engine), and that it also appeared to be quick. Following the completion of the tests, the car was dispatched to Toyota Team Europe's Cologne workshop, stored under a tarpaulin and eventually destroyed. Toyota would return to sportscar racing in 1998, with the Andr\u00e9 de Cortanze-designed Toyota GT-One.\n Passage 2:Fi\u0161er was born in Zagreb on June 13, 1905 to a Jewish family of well-known Croatian architect Ignjat Fischer and his wife Helena (n\u00e9e Egersrodfer).

In every legislative (except for the 2013 election) it emerged as one of the two strongest parties. V\u00e1clav Klaus served as the first Prime Minister of the Czech Republic after the partition of Czechoslovakia, from 1993 to 1997. Mirek Topol\u00e1nek, who succeeded him as leader of the party in December 2002, served as Prime Minister from 2006 to 2009.

Prior to the early 20th century, the Aleutian Islands were essentially ignored by the United States Armed Forces, although the islands played a small role in the Bering Sea Arbitration when a number of British and American vessels were stationed at Unalaska to enforce the arbitrators' decision. By the early 20th century, a number of war strategies examined the possibility of conflict breaking out between the Empire of Japan and the United States. While the Aleutian Islands were seen as a potential staging point for invasions by either side, this possibility was dismissed owing to the islands' dismal climate. In 1922, the Washington Naval Treaty was signed, after which the United States Navy began to take an interest in the islands. However, nothing of significance was to materialize until World War II.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Bleach was highly influenced by the heavy dirge-rock of the Melvins and Mudhoney, 1980s punk rock, and the 1970s heavy metal of Black Sabbath. Novoselic said in a 2001 interview with Rolling Stone that the band had played a tape in their van while on tour that had an album by The Smithereens on one side and an album by the extreme metal band Celtic Frost on the other, and noted that the combination probably played an influence as well. The money for the recording sessions for Bleach, listed as $606.17 on the album sleeve, was supplied by Jason Everman, who was subsequently brought into the band as the second guitarist. Though Everman did not actually play on the album, he received a credit on Bleach because, according to Novoselic, they \"wanted to make him feel more at home in the band\". Just prior to the album's release, Nirvana insisted on signing an extended contract with Sub Pop, making the band the first to do so with the label.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

However, the project was continuously abandoned due to the fairy tale's \"static\" plot and main characters. The filmmaker was also concerned about the \"unnecessary intensity\" required to depict Belle's imprisonment. Inspired by the unprecedented success of The Little Mermaid (1989), Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg green-lit another attempt at adapting \"Beauty and the Beast\" under the direction of Richard Purdum. However, Katzenberg did not approve of Purdum's dark, somber version of the fairy tale, and ultimately ordered that it be restarted from scratch in favor of creating a Broadway-style musical film starring a strong heroine, more similar to The Little Mermaid. Opting instead for a \"feminist twist\" on the original story, largely in response to critics' negative reception to Ariel regarding her pursuit of Eric being her overall character, Katzenberg hired television writer Linda Woolverton, who had never written an animated film before, to write the film's screenplay.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

In 1746 it was returned to Ottoman Empire by the Treaty of Kerden but lost to Russian Empire by the Treaty of San Stefano signed after the Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878). At the end of the First World War it was returned to Turkey.

Meanwhile, the congestion apparent in London and Middlesex for burials at the start of the century was causing public concern not least on health grounds. In 1837 a decision was made to lay out a new burial ground on the edge of Earl's Court in an outlying area of Brompton. The moving spirit behind the project was the engineer, Stephen Geary. It was necessary to form a company in order to get parliamentary permission to raise capital for the proposal. Securing the land \u2013 some 40 acres \u2013 from local landowner, Lord Kensington and the Equitable Gas Light Company, as well as raising the money proved an extended challenge. After two years the cemetery was duly established by Act of Parliament and laid out in 1839, it opened in 1840, originally as the West of London and Westminster Cemetery. It was consecrated by Charles James Blomfield, Bishop of London in June 1840, and is now one of Britain's oldest and most distinguished garden cemeteries, served by the adjacent West Brompton station.\n Passage 3:Mike Ditka, a tight end for the Bears from 1961 to 1966, was hired to coach the team by George Halas in 1982.

In the 1985 season the fire in the Bears\u2013Packers rivalry was re-lit when Ditka used 315 pound defensive tackle \"Refrigerator\" Perry as a running back in a touchdown play at Lambeau Field, against the Packers. The Bears won their ninth NFL Championship, first since the AFL-NFL merger, in Super Bowl XX after the 1985 season in which they dominated the NFL with their then-revolutionary 46 defense and a cast of characters that recorded the novelty rap song \"The Super Bowl Shuffle\". The season was notable in that the Bears had only one loss, the \"unlucky 13th\" game of the season, a Monday night affair in which they were defeated by the Miami Dolphins. At the time, much was made of the fact that the Dolphins were the only franchise in history to have had an undefeated season and post-season. The Dolphins came close to setting up a rematch in the Super Bowl, but lost to the New England Patriots in the AFC title game. \"The Super Bowl Shuffle\" was videotaped the day after that Monday night loss in Miami.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.
