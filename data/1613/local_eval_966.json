Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.", "input": "Last year the chance of someone born in October becoming an Oxbridge undergraduate was more than 30% higher than for someone born in July.\nIn seasonal terms, compared to the summer-born applicants, autumn births were 25% more likely to get an Oxbridge place, while for winter and spring births the figures were 17% and 15% more likely respectively.\nThis is according to data obtained from both universities under freedom of information and analysed by the BBC.\nIt raises the issue of whether universities should start to consider applicants' dates of birth when deciding who to give places to.\nIt is a well established fact in educational research that children who are younger in their year group at school tend on average to do significantly worse in terms of educational attainment. Known sometimes as the \"birthdate effect\" or \"relative age effect\", this generally diminishes as children get older but does not vanish.\nLess research has been done on the implications for later life, but what these Oxbridge admissions statistics now demonstrate is that the impact on life outcomes can persist beyond school.\nThe birthdate effect is also a recognised phenomenon in sport.\nWe obtained figures from both universities for the months of birth of undergraduate applicants for places in 2012. This data only refers to applicants resident in the UK, not international students. The statistics for both universities reveal a similar monthly pattern for those accepted.\nThis fits with the birthdate effect. The vast majority of UK applicants to Oxbridge are from England and Wales, where school year groups are formed on a September-August basis. Thus those who have been older within their year groups are more likely to reach Oxbridge than their younger classmates.\n(In Scotland, school year groups are formed on a March-February basis, and in Northern Ireland on a July-June basis. But only about 3 to 4% of UK-domiciled Oxbridge students are from Scotland or Northern Ireland, so the general picture is still valid.)\nOf course the number of people actually born in each month also varies, but this does not explain the variation in Oxbridge admissions. For comparison I have included in the table above the numbers of births by month in the UK in 1993/94, which is the year of birth for more than 80% of the students accepted in 2012.\nThe final column measures the relative impact for Oxbridge entrance of being born in that month compared to August.\nThis means that on this basis for someone born in September, say, the likelihood of an Oxbridge place in 2012 was 1.12 times (or 12% higher than) for someone born in August.\nIt takes into account the overall numbers born in that month 18 years previously. This is a simplified and quick analysis, which ignores various details. But none of these factors should alter the broad overall picture of the strong presence of a birthdate effect.\nHowever, in all this it is very important to note that for both universities a similar pattern - weighted towards birthdays earlier in the September-August academic year - applies to all applicants, not just those who were accepted.\nThis suggests the birthdate effect (like some other inequalities) is already present in influencing which pupils are doing well enough at school to apply to Oxbridge.\nIn other words, the Oxbridge admissions process is probably reflecting a pre-established pattern of educational disadvantage, not creating it.\nBoth Oxford and Cambridge routinely issue a broad collection of statistics relating to admissions, such as gender, ethnicity, disability, region and school type of candidates. However neither proactively publishes the data on month of birth, which we therefore obtained through requests under the Freedom of Information Act.\nBoth universities state they do not take an applicant's month of birth into account in the admissions process. A Cambridge spokesperson said that an analysis of admissions statistics should examine a range of variables over several years. Neither university wanted to issue any further reaction.\nThe impact of month of birth on a wide range of child and adult outcomes is currently the subject of a major research project conducted by the Institute of Fiscal Studies, which is expected to report in May.\nEllen Greaves, one of the IFS researchers, commented: \"The data obtained by the BBC show that universities, including Oxford and Cambridge, may be missing out on some of the brightest students by accepting disproportionate numbers of pupils born earlier in the academic year.\"\n\"Although much could and should be done to address these inequalities earlier in the education system, it is in each university's interest to make sure that they consider a pupil's month of birth in their admissions process.\"", "output": "The likelihood of becoming a student at Oxford or Cambridge Universities can be strongly influenced by date of birth.", "category": "Summarization 416.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an article.

It all goes back to Schrodinger's cat, but that's another story....\nSubatomic particles such as electrons, photons or ions can be made to behave in this mysterious way.\nAnd because of this flexibility, qubits can do a lot more - a quantum computer could theoretically carry out trillions of calculations per second.\nBut these computers aren't easy to build or operate. Quantum processors from one of the leading manufacturers in this field -  D-Wave -  need to be cooled to just above absolute zero (-273.15C). They also need to be free from any electromagnetic interference.\nThis makes them bulky and costly; D-Wave's computers cost about $10m-15m.\nIronically they're also a bit limited in the kinds of calculations they can currently do, and many observers are still sceptical about how fast they really are.\nSo it's fair to say we're still at the very early stages of quantum computing.\nGoldman Sachs, RBS, Guggenheim Partners and Commonwealth Bank of Australia have all invested in quantum computing, with the aim of stealing a march on their competitors.\n\"This is interesting to the financial world because if you can find an algorithmic advantage to solve a problem, that can give you a great competitive advantage,\" says Colin Williams, director of business development for D-Wave.\nGoogle, Nasa, Lockheed Martin, the US Department of Energy and the University of Southern California have all used D-Wave's systems so far.\nOther tech companies, such as Cambridge Quantum Computing, QxBranch and Rigetti, are also rushing to develop the hardware and software needed to make quantum computing a reality.\nQuantum computers could solve problems in a day that would take classical computers thousands of years to solve.\nSo in the world of investment, they could consider millions of different global investment scenarios and calculate which ones have the best chance of success over the long-term.\n\"We can build an optimal portfolio today, but tomorrow it won't be optimal and needs to be rebalanced, which is expensive,\" says Marcos Lopez de Prado, a senior managing director at Guggenheim Partners.\nQuantum computers could, in theory, give investment firms much better visibility over the longer-term to make more accurate predictions and reduce this need to tinker with their portfolios, saving costs and possibly boosting profits.\n\"If you can predict the US dollar/Swiss franc exchange rate a tenth of a cent more reliably, then the value isn't in the computer, it's in the cost saving,\" says Mr Williams.\nBetter forecasting could also reduce the prevalence of high-frequency trading, which has been accused of creating market volatility.\nHigh-frequency traders have also been blamed for raising the costs of trading for ordinary investors by swooping into purchases nanoseconds before an interested party and reselling the stocks at a higher price.\nSo how soon will quantum computers be readily available?\nD-Wave's Mr Williams reckons businesses will have access to quantum computing functionality by 2018, whereas RBS's Mr Hanley thinks it will be \"five to 10 years before quantum computing comes of age\".\nBut this isn't stopping financial institutions getting excited.\nBlu Putnam, chief economist for the CME group - a US-based derivatives market - says quantum computing has led to a \"mind-set change\" where financial services \"now seek out the nearly impossible to solve problems\" in asset and risk management.\nBefore then, there is a lot of preparation to do.\nQuantum computers can't be interrogated in the same way as traditional computers. The algorithms - sets of complex mathematical rules - used for classical computing need to be reworked to fit into the quantum system.\nAnd finding and training computer scientists to understand and use these systems effectively is another big challenge for the financial services industry.\nBut Mr Hanley says: \"Rather than observe these changes from a distance or be last in the queue, I'd rather be at the front and have a seat at the board.\"\nQuantum computing may offer potential benefits to the financial services industry, but it also poses risks.\nBanks rely on encryption to keep their transactions and customer data secure. This involves scrambling and unscrambling data using keys made of very large numbers - tens, if not hundreds, of digits long.\nA hacker would have to find the right key by trial and error and test it in order to unlock the data - a process that could take hundreds of years even with the most powerful of today's supercomputers.\nBut quantum computers could crack the code with relative ease, potentially undermining the security of the entire global financial services industry.\nSuch a possibility leads Mr Lopez de Prado to fear that governments might outlaw quantum computers entirely.\n\"Governments could say they should be banned because otherwise there would be no secrets, but they can't be un-invented.\n\"We need a new mathematical breakthrough that creates an unbreakable encryption,\" he says.\nCryptographers are busy working on new algorithms to block attacks from future quantum computers and many believe this will be possible.\nBut the industry needs this breakthrough fast.

In fact, only six of Roy Hodgson's 21-man England squad to face Germany and the Netherlands have not benefitted from a loan spell at one point in their career.\nThe ease of which players do so may all be about to change, though, with Fifa planning to end the current emergency loan system in England's Football League.\nThat would mean no more loan windows - the current one shuts on Thursday - outside of the normal transfer windows.\nFifa are scrapping it to protect the \"sporting integrity of competitions\" and, after a one-season reprieve from changes, the Football Association rules will now fall in line with Fifa's desire from next term onwards - something many in the Football League are not happy about.\n\"Where are they going to play?\" Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy asked BBC Look East.\n\"You're only allowed three overage players in the under-21s. If you've got a squad of 24 or 25 and some need to have some football, somebody beneath us could loan one of our players - what's wrong in doing that?\n\"Harry Kane wouldn't be the England striker without him going to Millwall, Leicester and Norwich. Without having those experiences going out, they don't get to be the players they are today.\"\nThe changes will bring an end to 28-day and 93-day loans outside the transfer window, meaning the only loan Kane would not have been able to go on was the one to Leicester, but a different system may have meant different planning for buying clubs.\nThis season, McCarthy has brought in Arsenal's 18-year-old winger Ainsley Maitland-Niles, who has since gone on to make 31 appearances, a total he would probably have got nowhere near if he had stayed with the Premier League title hopefuls.\n\"It seems to get good young players, who are never, ever going to play in the top team's first team, some experience,\" said McCarthy. \"Where are they going to get it?\n\"The big teams still won't put them in to their first team, they'll buy somebody else.\"\nBut it is not just about developing youngsters. This season, Ipswich's stuttering Championship play-off charge was given new life by bringing in midfielder Ben Pringle from Fulham in February, and he has scored the only goal in two 1-0 wins during his seven games so far.\nUnder the new rules, McCarthy would have needed to sign him two weeks earlier in the January transfer window.\nThat gives clubs a new headache to deal with.\n\"Once the window shuts, it shuts,\" said Peterborough director of football Barry Fry.\n\"What do clubs do? Do they carry a bigger squad to compensate for injuries or suspensions or do they go with what they've got, and if they do pick up a load of injuries, they've got to rely on their youth players. Now are the youth players good enough to make that jump into the first team?\n\"I can see some clubs carrying 35 or 40 players, which is far too many because they won't be able to afford them anyway and won't be able to get them off the wage bill by loaning them out. It's a crazy decision by Fifa.\"\nHowever, their feelings are not shared by all in the Football League, with Exeter City manager Paul Tisdale seemingly not too fussed by the changes.\n\"I'm not passionate about it one way or the other,\" he said. \"We prefer to bring our own players through and if we have the choice to play a developing player at Exeter or someone else's developing player we will go for our own.\n\"I'm not particularly driven to offer too much of a comment, because it's not something we often use.\"\nOne player the League Two club do have on loan is striker Jayden Stockley, signed in January and currently in his ninth loan spell away from parent club AFC Bournemouth.\nHe is the exact type of player the new ruling will impact. So why go out on loan in the first place?\n\"I wanted to get out and make my own successes and hopefully build up a career I can be proud of,\" he told BBC Radio Devon.\n\"Ultimately this is the level I need to prove myself so I'm not looking at the Premier League, that's a long way off.\n\"I want to climb the leagues at a steady pace, in a way in which you lay foundations at a steady pace to play higher.\"\nChanges to the loan system may mean that young players at Premier League clubs will end up playing more of their football in the under-21s league.\nBut, in the words of former Stoke youngster James Alabi, if you are not a player on the verge of the first team or over the age of 18 playing in the under-21s, \"you're wasting your time\" because of the gap to the senior squad.\nAlabi was one of the many players sent out of top-flight clubs to get some experience in the lower-leagues.\nHe scored 10 minutes into his Football League debut for Scunthorpe but, after a nine-game loan spell at Glanford Park, he then only made a combined total of three starts in his next four loan spells.\nIt is safe to say he is not a fan of short-term loans.\n\"As a footballer you need to settle in, get to know players well and they get to know you well,\" he said. \"You can't make as much of an impact as you'd like to unless you have a decent few games, but in football that doesn't always happen.\n\"It 100% hindered my development. I felt like I didn't have enough time to show what I'd do, the month went by quickly and what happens if you get an injury or a red card?\n\"I went on loan and got a red card in the first game and they didn't extend the loan.\"\nVia a brief spell at Ipswich, Alabi now finds himself at National League side Chester, where in his sixth match he scored four goals in the first half.\nWhatever he or the rest of English football feels about these changes to the loan system, all of the Football League will need to adapt to the changes in a bid to unearth the next Harry Kane.", "output": "It is quite a strange sight seeing a fresh-faced Harry Kane celebrating a goal for Millwall, isn't it?", "category": "Summarization 416.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an article.

Now he wants to know what his British ally will do to help.\nEurope's two military giants have both carried out strikes in Iraq, and British forces have helped with intelligence and refuelling over Syria.  But so far the UK Parliament has refused to sanction RAF air strikes in Syria.\nMr Hollande may well be hoping that the UN Security Council resolution last week, which called on member states to take \"all necessary measures\" to challenge IS in Iraq and Syria, will have changed Mr Cameron's assessment and lead him to ask parliament again.\nThe prime minister, who is due to present a comprehensive defence plan to parliament later this week, gave a strong personal endorsement to the French leader's stance.\n\"I firmly support the action that President Hollande has taken to strike (IS) in Syria and it is my firm conviction that Britain should do so too,\" he said.\nHe also offered France the use of Britain's Akrotiri military base in Cyprus to help with operations and refuelling.\nBut this is just the start of Mr Hollande's week of diplomacy.  After his meeting with David Cameron, he flies to Washington to discuss the situation with US President Barack Obama, before coming back to Paris for a meeting with the German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday.\nThe emphasis in each meeting will be slightly different.  Aside from the need to assess the US-led military strategy in the Middle East, there are growing calls from European leaders to improve intelligence and data sharing.\nSecurity forces in both France and Belgium have been embarrassed by revelations that key suspects behind the Paris attacks moved around freely in the weeks leading up to the assaults, and in the days afterwards, even passing through checkpoints with apparent ease.\nAnd hanging over all the discussion of military and technical co-ordination is the elusive goal of a political solution in Syria which could help eradicate the militants' territory and source of revenue.  That is likely to be central to Thursday's talks in Moscow, between Mr Hollande and Vladimir Putin, his fourth foreign leader in as many days.\nAs experts point out, France - with its historically cordial ties to Russia, its membership of Nato, and its presence in the Middle East region - is in a unique position to help procure an agreement, and with it greater security at home.\nIn the meantime, Mr Hollande has a few other things on his mind, not least preparing for the UN Climate Conference which begins at the end of the month.

As a result the club is currently undertaking a thorough investigation of any past links he might have had with the organisation.\"\nAccording to the Guardian, an anonymous ex-footballer has also contacted police to say he was a victim of George Ormond - a former Newcastle United youth coach who was jailed in 2002 for offences against young footballers in the area.\nA spokesman for Northumbria Police told the Guardian it had received an allegation of \"historic sexual offences in Newcastle\" and inquiries were ongoing.\nOrmond was sentenced to six years in prison for sex offences against boys aged between 13 and 21 committed between 1974 and 1994.\nThe judge called him a \"predatory abuser of young boys\" who \"used his position as a football coach to target vulnerable children\" and \"prevented disclosure by the power wielded over them as their coach\".\nMr Stewart, 52, who started his career at Blackpool and also played for Tottenham, Manchester City and Liverpool, first told the Daily Mirror an unnamed coach - not Bennell - abused him daily for four years up to the age of 15.\nIn an emotional interview with BBC sports editor Dan Roan, Mr Stewart said he believed there were \"hundreds of victims\" of sexual abuse who could come forward.\nHe also claimed:\nMr Stewart said he finally escaped his alleged abuser at the age of 15, signing for Blackpool, where he made his professional debut at 17.\n\"I was told that I had to do these things if I wanted to be a footballer,\" he said. \"I only ever wanted to be a footballer as a child. He was threatening that he would kill my parents and my two brothers if I ever spoke out. I was just absolutely frightened.\"\nAsked if he feared the allegations football is facing could be as big as the Savile scandal, he told the BBC: \"Yes, I do, for sure. I would almost guarantee it as long as the victims are willing to come forward.\"\nAfter his death, former DJ and television presenter Savile was found to be one of the UK's most prolific sexual predators.\nMr Stewart also spoke of the heartache of having to show his family the Mirror story before it was published, saying he had been unable to show his son and two daughters in person.\nHe added: \"This has not been easy for me to do.\n\"But I felt that I needed to do this so other people will come out and with the hope that it may stop anyone who may be thinking of doing it again, in any walk of life - not just football.\"\nHe added: \"The access to children at sport level is very easy and it is the perfect ground for them to prey.\n\"I do believe, in the days it was happening to me, it was a taboo subject, nobody spoke about it. It was brushed under the carpet if it was happening. I don't think there was anywhere to turn in those days.\"\nSports minister Tracey Crouch said the former players had shown \"incredible bravery\" to speak about the abuse.\nShadow sports minister Dr Rosena Allin-Khan warned the scandal could \"seriously damage\" UK football's reputation.\nThe NSPCC said callers to the abuse hotline had raised concerns about children now and in the past, and it expected \"many more\" to come forward.\nInformation from 20 callers would be passed to police, the children's charity said.\nManchester United and England captain Wayne Rooney, an NSPCC ambassador, said: \"It's awful that some of my colleagues have suffered this way whilst playing the sport that I and they love. It's important that people know that it's OK to speak out, there is help available and that they don't need to suffer in silence.\"\nBennell was sentenced to nine years in prison in 1998 after admitting sexual offences against six boys.\nHe was a youth coach at Crewe Alexandra in the 1980s and 1990s and also had a close association with Stoke City and Manchester City.\nCheshire Police said 11 people had come forward since Mr Woodward spoke out, including fellow ex-Crewe player Mr Walters, 44, who says he was also a victim of Bennell.\nFormer Manchester City and England player Mr White, 49, says Bennell abused him between 1979 and 1980 while he was playing for Whitehill FC junior team in Manchester.\nSo far, Greater Manchester Police has not received any official reports of abuse but, in a statement, it said any victim should have confidence officers would treat complaints seriously and thoroughly investigate them.\nOn Thursday evening, police were seen at Bennell's address in Milton Keynes, removing a dog and some boxes.\nCrewe's director of football Dario Gradi, who has been associated with the club for more than 30 years, released a statement saying he knew nothing about Bennell's abuse of young footballers until his arrest in the US in 1994.\n\"I knew nothing of his crimes before this time when he was employed by us,\" said Mr Gradi, who managed the club from 1983 to 2007 and for short spells afterwards.\n\"No-one at the football club knew of Bennell's crimes until his arrest in 1994 and his subsequent prosecution in the UK.\"\nHe said he would make no further comment until Crewe had carried out a review.\nThe Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) said it expected the number of people coming forward to rise.\nPFA chief executive Gordon Taylor told BBC Sport: \"There's always talk of hidden agendas and cover-ups. I can only speak from my own experience and the PFA's point of view. There's no cover up. It's our business to help players and resolve problems.\n\"We have seen an increase in the number of players to come forward. We can only do our best. There might be youngsters that this caused them not to have a career in the game. We need to encompass the whole lot.\"\nFormer FA chief executive, Mark Palios, told the BBC he was not surprised by the allegations.\nHe said it would be \"naive\" to suggest abuse has not gone on within the game.\n\"It's an issue like racism - you can't be complacent that you've actually dealt with it. But I'm pretty certain that the position today is far better than it was 20 to 30 years ago when it was pretty much un-regulated.\"\nThe FA's head of equality and safeguarding, Sue Ravenlaw, said the \"courage and dignity\" shown by the four footballers who have spoken out was \"immense\".", "output": "\"Hundreds\" of children may have been sexually abused by figures within football, former Tottenham and England player Paul Stewart has told the BBC.", "category": "Summarization 416.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an article.

Many of the delegates will stay in swish hotels nearby.\nThis is the third such London gathering since 2012, and there is an element of \"cut and paste\" to its agenda, which focuses on security, governance and the economy.\nThe official conference document emphasises how much progress has been made.\nBut its description of Somalia from the time of the first meeting still applies: \"Chronically unstable and ungoverned\", and threatened by Islamist militants, piracy and famine.\nThere has been some improvement.\nPiracy, which at its height cost $7bn (\u00c2\u00a35.4bn) a year, is much diminished, although there has been a recent resurgence.\nUS drones, African Union troops, Western \"security advisers\" and Somali forces have pushed al-Shabab from most major towns, although the jihadists still control many areas and attack at will.\nA recent electoral process resulted in a new and - for the time being - popular president, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, nicknamed Farmajo, and more female and youth representation in parliament.\nSomalia is in a \"pre-famine\" stage rather than the full-blown disaster of 2011, in which more than 250,000 people died.\nBut it is perhaps surprising that the current water shortage will not be a headline topic at the conference.\nThe country is in the grip of its worst drought in decades. Four successive rainy seasons have failed.\nEven before you enter Burao Regional Hospital, in the self-declared Republic of Somaliland's drought-stricken Togdheer region, you hear the haunting, high-pitched wailing of malnourished children.\nOne boy, dressed in purple, stares blankly at the wall. \"His brain is damaged due to a prolonged lack of adequate nutrition,\" says Dr Yusuf Ali, who returned home to Somalia from the UK two years ago. \"He will never recover.\"\nAccording to Unicef, the number of children who are or will be acutely malnourished in 2017 is up by 50% from the beginning of the year, to a total of 1.4 million, including 275,000 for whom the condition is or will be life-threatening.\nMost are too sick to go to school or help herd animals, making the life of the country's many nomads even more precarious.\nPeople are already dying from hunger and diseases that strike those weakened by lack of food.\nSeverely malnourished children are nine times more likely than healthy ones to die from illnesses such as measles and diarrhoea.\nThe World Health Organization says there were more than 25,000 cases of cholera in the first four months of 2017, with the number expected to more than double to 54,000 by June.\nMore than 500 people have already died from the disease.\nIt is not just humans who are suffering.\nIn Somaliland, officials say, 80% of livestock have died.\nLivestock is the mainstay of the economy - the ports in Somaliland and nearby Djibouti export more live animals than anywhere else in the world, mainly to the Gulf.\nIn south-western Somalia, tens of thousands of drought-affected people have fled to Baidoa, clustering into flimsy, makeshift shelters on the outskirts of the city.\nThis area - known as the \"triangle of death\" - was the epicentre of the famines of 2011 and 1991.\n\"Al-Shabab is harvesting the boys and men we left behind on our parched land, offering them a few dollars and a meal,\" says one woman. \"Against their will, our children and husbands have become the jihadists' new army.\"\n\"The biggest problem in dealing with this drought is insecurity,\" says Sharif Hassan Sheikh Aden, president of South West State, in his modest palace in Baidoa.\nThe city, which is protected by a ring of Ethiopian troops, is right in the heart of al-Shabab country. \"The militants have closed all the roads so we cannot deliver help to those who need it most.\"\nThis brings home in the starkest of terms why security is top of the London Somalia Conference agenda.\nAs long as Somalia remains violent, with different parts of the country controlled by a multitude of often conflicting armed groups, it will be impossible to deliver emergency assistance, let alone long-term development.\nThe recently created South West State is one of the regions making up the new federal Somalia.\nCritics fear this will lead to balkanisation, and risks introducing another dimension to conflict, as the new states rub up against each other and start fighting. This has already happened in central Somalia, where last year there were deadly clashes between Puntland and Galmudug states.\nThe attitude of people in South West State shows how much of a gamble the federal system is.\n\"We have always been marginalised and looked down on by other Somalis,\" says a farmer, Fatima Issa.\n\"We do not want the federal troops here. They don't hunt down al-Shabab the way our local militias do. We should push for more autonomy, maybe even break away and declare independence like Somaliland did in 1991.\"\nOne aim of the London Somalia Conference is to push for more progress on the sharing of resources between the regions and the centre. This contentious issue has been debated since before the first London gathering in 2012.\nSouth West State has a special friendship with Ethiopia, which is not on the best of terms with the new federal government. This highlights another possible problem - some foreign powers have started to sign bilateral agreements with regional states.\nFor instance, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is building a military base in Somaliland, a territory the federal government considers an integral part of Somalia. The UAE has also given military hardware to Jubaland State in southern Somalia.\nSomalia's former special envoy to the US, Abukar Arman, has described the London Somalia Conference as a \"predatory carnival\", with foreign powers gathering to slice up Somalia for their own benefit.\nSome in Somalia see it as a waste of time.\n\"It is an expensive talking-shop,\" says Ahmed Mohamed, a rickshaw driver in the capital Mogadishu. \"The politicians and diplomats are obsessed with the conference instead of taking action on the drought.\"\nBut lessons have been learned, and there is now a far more nuanced approach to Somalia than there was when the crisis began, in the late 1980s.\nThe US response to the Somali famine of 1991 was to send in nearly 30,000 troops. This ended in a humiliating withdrawal, following the shooting down of two US Black Hawk helicopters in 1993.\nNow, much of the talk is of \"Somali-owned\" processes, although the shadows of a growing number of foreign powers can be seen lurking in the background.", "output": "This Thursday, the great and the good will descend on London to discuss Somalia, a country that has topped the Fragile States Index for eight of the past 10 years.", "category": "Summarization 416.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an article.

The results are expected to be revealed on Saturday.\nEngland's batsmen struggled on turning pitches during the 1-1 drawn series in Bangladesh but were assured in Rajkot, albeit on a placid surface.\nHere, fears about the tourists' batting were realised, with the top order failing once more. Of the past eight occasions when England have lost at least four wickets, the fourth has fallen with the score under 100 six times.\nWhile captain Alastair Cook was the victim of a wonderful delivery from Mohammed Shami that moved back into the left-hander to snap off stump, all of the rest had a hand in their own demise.\nThe busy Root played with fluency, particularly through the on side, for his half-century, until even he was culpable in the mix-up that saw Hameed run out for 13.\nFour wickets fell for 29 runs before Stokes and Jonny Bairstow clawed their way through 14 overs. Even then, Stokes needed the fortune of a Jayant Yadav delivery hitting the off bail but not dislodging it.\nThough England lost Cook in the third over of their reply, Hameed and Root - a second-wicket pair with a combined age of 44 - added 47 in assured fashion.\nAfter that, the England slide began.\nFormer England batsman Geoffrey Boycott\nIt's been poor, poor batting. They got themselves out: a run-out; Duckett played inside the line; it was immature by Root - one turned and hit his glove, then he went to slog it over the top; Moeen just got his pad on the line. The low scuttler hasn't got anybody out and I haven't seen the jumping ball yet.\nFormer England captain Michael Vaughan\nBen Duckett's mind is going to be frazzled now. We saw him pressing down the line of leg stump and that exposed his off stump. He's got a real issue against the off-spinners - England are going to have to iron that out very quickly.\nFormer England off-spinner Vic Marks\nI don't think this pitch has deteriorated that much yet. The ball has not been jumping and turning it viciously but England have made some mistakes. England had a horrible session. It all seemed relatively calm until the run-out - and then it all started to disintegrate.\nEngland's spinners were disappointing on Thursday, coming in for criticism from Michael Vaughan after bowling 49 wicketless overs.\nOn the second morning, following the visitors' curious reluctance to attack first-day centurion Virat Kohli and Ashwin with the second new ball, off-spinner Moeen turned the tide.\nOne delivery after Ashwin was dropped by Stokes at slip, Moeen had Kohli held by the same man for 167.\nWhen both Wriddhiman Saha and Ravi Jadeja were pinned lbw - the latter opting not to review one that would have missed leg stump - Moeen had three wickets in 14 deliveries.\nEngland were held up by Ashwin's second half-century of the series, made in partnership with debutant Jayant, but, after Ashwin edged Stokes behind, neither Jayant and Umesh Yadav could resist swiping at Adil Rashid.\nIndia had lost their last six wickets for 104 runs, a slide likely to be rendered inconsequential by England's more dramatic slump.\nEngland assistant coach Paul Farbrace to TMS: \"Some of the dismissals, you can look back and say they were disappointing. We need to find a way to scrap and fight in those situations, rather than having those mini collapses. That's something we have to eradicate from our batting.\n\"We've got to find a way to be tougher or stronger in that situation. The two at the end showed that if you apply yourself and you get stuck in and you're resolute and you've got some guts then you can get through those tough periods.\n\"Certainly with the bat we have got to cut those sloppy periods of play - we have got to play better.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device", "output": "India took firm control of the second Test as England's top order failed on the second evening in Visakhapatnam.", "category": "Summarization 416.json"}]
