Almost without fail,  there are several cases from the Board of Immigration Appeals where another convicted illegal immigrant's attorney is arguing that his particular client's United States convictions are not serious enough crimes to justify deporting him back to Mexico or elsewhere in Latin America.  \n\nI just checked, since February 24, 2016, there have been six (6) such opinions.  That's better than one per week.  And these are just where they bothered with a written opinion, the 'cream of the crop' as it were of criminal illegal immigrants.  \n\nAnd the 9th Circuit doesn't cover New Mexico or Texas or a lot of other border States.\n\nI'll be glad to list the convictions that they were saying shouldn't require deportation, if you like.  There are plenty of drug dealers and  rapists in the mix as well as quite a few other crimes, of course.  \n\nI will also be happy to list the multiple deportations cases, if you like.", "output": "Yes", "category": "Toxic Language Detection 790.json"}, {"instruction": "Categorize the comment on the basis of sexual explicitness.
