'\nplease , god , make him stop !\n\" as it turns out ,\n\"\nthe postman \" is a much better film than i had expected .\ndespite being set in 2013 , the movie is , at heart , a western : a band of thugs terrorizes peaceful villagers ; a wandering hero opposes the bandits and inspires others to fight back .\nthe setting , however , allows that familiar plot to take on greater significance : american society has collapsed due to plagues and wars , and survivors live behind barracades in isolated villages .\nthe struggle of a dead society to be reborn has a grand quality and deserves the epic scale costner grants it .\ncostner 's nameless character , a wandering actor , rides in from the vast wasteland and is soon shanghaied into the service of general bethlehem ( will patton ) , a former copy - machine salesman turned bandit king .\nour hero escapes and discovers the body of a dead postman .\ntaking the uniform and bag of mail , he passes himself off as a representative of \" the restored united states .\n\"\nhe is shocked at the hope that he inspires in the people he meets .\none young disciple , ford lincoln mercury ( larenz tate ) , organizes a full - scale postal service .\nford spreads the postman 's message of hope until bethlehem finds that the once - meek villagers are beginning to resist his rule .\nas war breaks out between bethlehem 's army and the postal workers , costner 's character steps into the legend he created and goes from self - centered loner to leader of the revolution .\nhis lie of the restored united states becomes a self - fulfilling prophecy .\n\" postman \" is an odd blend of a bleak setting and a message of wide - eyed optimism ( sort of \" sergio leone meets frank capra \" ) , but its treatment of hope and renewal is compelling .\nwhat could have been another knock - off of \" the road warrior \" ( like \" waterworld \" was ) surprises the viewer with a sensitively told story of nobility emerging from rubble .\ntate is the stand - out in the movie 's large cast .\nford lincoln mercury ( self - named ) is the polar opposite of o - dog , tate 's character in his debut film , \" menace ii society \" ( 1993 ) , and tate makes ford 's innocent belief in hope as convincing as o - dog 's cynicism and brutality .\nhis performance sells the movie .\ninterestingly , as tate moves from his usual street - smart roles to youthful optimism , the soft - eyed patton , who usually plays nice guys , proves a disarming villain .\nolivia williams makes her film debut as the postman 's love interest , abby .\nwhen they first meet , abby asks him to father her child because her husband is sterile .\npredictably , the husband is soon eliminated by the bandits , and abby is thrown back into the company of the hero .\nhowever , their relationship develops slowly as the emotional conflicts of both characters are explored\n( she , torn by grief , guilt , and anger ; he , resisting his destiny ) .\n\"\nthe postman

frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal .\na soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nation - state against another .\na common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain .\na terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end .\nif the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy , the violence continues .\nit is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone ( even total innocents ) , anywhere , at anytime that gives the figure his label .\nedward zwick 's the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states .\nyou 'd think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines .\narab terrorists kill american citizens abroad , and the u . s . responds by retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack .\nhowever , unlike the real - life tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin laden 's camp and manufacturing facility , the film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal .\nin retaliation , the terrorists bring the fight to the new world .\nunwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agent - in - charge anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , who works out of the bureau 's new york office at one federal plaza .\nwhile investigating a series of bombings in the big apple , he encounters cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , also trying to uncover information .\ngenerally , the fbi is charged with problems inside the u . s . , while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm .\neven spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country .\nhubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory , but as the two form a tentative professional relationship , hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government .\nthe original tagline for patriot games was , \" there has never been a terrorist attack on american soil . \" however true , it was pulled before the movie 's release because it sounded too much like a dare . revisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states , the siege is almost an invitation in itself , because it shows just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were to set up operations here in america .\nadmittedly , the terror wrought upon new york is a bit excessive ( who 's going to believe that a few bombs are going to cause new yorkers to jump at the backfire of a bus or to curtail their shopping by two - thirds ? ) , but the basic premise is still valid .\ni liked the fact that this film rises above the basic action - thriller fare of good guy g - men against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society and law and order .\nit provides a very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of a few arabs would escalate into a series of hate crimes against the arab - american population , and that in an effort to find the terrorists , the civil liberties of the minority may be violated by the government itself .\nin fact , about halfway through the film , when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city , the liberties of all americans are put at risk .\nalthough it may actually be a side effect of a terrorist campaign , the demise of social order in america is a scary thought and a goal which would not be beneath many international terrorist groups .\nthroughout , the film maintains a conflict between hubbard , who wants to use the fbi to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law , and general devereaux ( bruce willis ) , who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully .\nwhat results is a fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act , utilizing philosophy and historical examples to make points on both sides .\nit actually gets rather heady at times , but it 's a credit to screenwriters\nzwick , lawrence wright , and menno meyjes that they do n't underestimate the intelligence of the audience .\ni do n't know if it 's his tone or inflection or something else , but denzel washington has a way of spitting out dialog that makes whatever he says sound great .\nthis , combined with his innate acting ability and his experience in playing the mid - level authority figure , makes his performance in the siege convincing and enjoyable .\nannette bening gives one of the more assertive portrayals of a female character i 've seen recently , and the chemistry she shares with washington is palpable .\nit 's somewhat unfortunate that her character 's fortitude is broken at a certain point , but it allows us to watch bening play a little more range .\nbruce willis is pretty much relegated to a tough - guy role , always standing straight , and with a permanent scowl fixed upon his face .\nhowever , the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard is a major drive behind the film 's development .\nnotable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad , a lebanese immigrant .\nthe role calls for evidencing both a kind of filial pride for his heritage , and contempt for those of his own race who might interfere with his integration into the american society .\ndifficult to say the least , shalhoub does it with a naturalness you can almost reach out and touch .\nperhaps best known for his role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom \" wings , \" shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic abilities in the wonderful film big night .\nwhereas denzel washington seems to be edward zwick 's favorite actor ( he directed washington in glory and courage under fire ) , james horner seems to be his favorite composer .\ni therefore found it odd that zwick chose the prolific score - writer graeme revell ( seven films this year already ) over horner for the siege until i realized that this film contained a lot of arabian - themed music , and horner 's record has shown more of a propensity for scores either neutral in ethnicity or irish - sounding at most .\nrevell\ndoes a good job at providing appropriate music to punctuate key scenes and allowing the score to enhance the movie as a whole .\nit 's nowhere near as intrusive as in some of the other films we 've been getting throughout the year .\nmissteps in the siege can be found in a couple of the excesses it takes .\nfor example , it 's pretty clear throughout that the film is meant to be more of thriller than an action flick .\nunfortunately , there 's a scene where the army just cuts loose against some arab immigrants in a blatant display of firepower and explosions , obviously meant for the sole purpose of being eye - catching .\nin the middle of the city ( and against no real opposition ) , zwick even has the army use a cobra attack helicopter to shoot rockets into a building no farther than 50 feet from friendly troops .\nverisimilitude really goes out the window at that point .\nthe film also gets a little preachy toward the end , focusing on the ability of different races to get along .\na noble gesture , the film just puts the message across a bit too obviously .\nthese flaws are glaring , but they do n't detract too much from an otherwise good film that makes you think about issues you may not have considered since history class .", "output":

's gate \" ( 1980 ) or \" ishtar \" ( 1987 ) were bad .\ninstead , it literally drips off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with , which begs the question of why it was made in the first place .\nwith all the good scripts lying around hollywood un - produced , how does needless drek like this make its way to the big screen ?\nof course , tarzan is one of the most filmed characters in all of motion picture history - he has appeared in over forty films , which have ranged from the very good ( 1984 's \" greystoke : the legend of tarzan , lord of the apes \" ) down to the really bad ( 1981 's \" tarzan , the ape man \" with bo derek ) .\nmost of these films were just cheapie b - movies made in the thirties and forties , starring ex - olympic athletes and a lot of cutsie chimps .\ntherefore , if another tarzan movie is to be made , one might assume that it would have something new to offer - a different angle , an original storyline , anything to set it apart from all the others .\n\" greystoke \" added a never - before - seen level of realism to the pulpy tale , and even \" tarzan , the ape man \" at least had the mis - guided audacity to sexualize the story as a vehicle for bo derek 's bare breasts .\n\" tarzan and the lost city , \" on the other hand , has absolutely nothing to offer but a bunch of recycled storylines and bad dialogue .\nthe script , by bayard johnson and\nj .\nanderson black is about as formulaic and generic as they come .\ncomic books have better plots than this .\nthe movie is so bad\n, in fact , that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked in last summer 's comedy \" george of the jungle .\n\" did n't the producers think to leave that back in the old weissmuller pictures where it belongs ?\nthe story starts with the legend of tarzan already firmly established : a quick opening narration tells of tarzan ( casper van dien ) being found in the jungle after having been raised by apes , and his return to england where he assumes his greystoke heritage .\nwhen the movie starts in 1913 , he is a civilized english gentleman ( without an english accent ) , and he is to marry jane ( jane march ) in less than a week .\nhowever , when a wicked archeologist / grave - robber named nigel ravens ( steve waddington ) begins hunting for the fabled lost city of opar , one of africa 's last great secrets , the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to the jungle .\nat first , jane refuses to go , pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding ; but after tarzan leaves she changes her mind and tracks him down , therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her and her ape - man .\nonce the film gets going ( in its own sluggish way ) , it delves into a series of jungle adventures , as tarzan , jane , and the natives attempt the thwart ravens and his crew from discovering the city .\nmost of the so - called adventures are cheesy , predictable , and unexciting , with no pace , tension , or action to speak of .\nthere are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies , ranging from \" raiders of the lost ark \" ( 1981 ) to \" the goonies \" ( 1985 ) .\nwhen the movie is running short on action , it includes a few greenpeace - friendly scenes of tarzan freeing caged animals , releasing a baby elephant from a trap , and throwing ivory tusks into the river .\nthe movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality . for instance , when tarzan - who was raised in the jungle - is bit by a cobra , he does n't even attempt to suck the venom out like any semi - experienced weekend backpacker would do .\ninstead , he ties a tourniquet around his arm and stumbles off into the jungle with no plan for survival .\nof course , one ca n't help but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is . not to ruin the ending or anything , but there is no lost city .\nthere is , however ,\na lost pyramid , which i suppose is all the resource - strapped fx department could come up with ( the special effects are not worthy of a made - for - tv movie ) . which also brings up the question of why the treasure hunters had to slog through numerous underground caverns to get to the lost pyramid , when it 's sitting right out in the middle of an open field ? strictly speaking , \" tarzan and the lost city \" is n't even bad enough to have camp quality , although casper van dien 's laughably stiff performance comes real close .\nthis movie proves what \" starship troopers \" only hinted at : he can not act , but he sure looks well - groomed , even in the deepest heart of the african jungle .\nvan dien is much too much of a pretty - boy to be an effective tarzan ; he 's a calvin klein model in a loin cloth .\ni also wondered what the make - up department was thinking when it outfitted him with that awful circa-1983 steve perry haircut .\nwaddington makes a decent villain , although he 's like a charmless version of belloq from \" raiders of the lost ark .\n\" as jane , the ex - model jane march has little to do but smile and look pretty next to tarzan .\nshe does fire off a gun at the evil treasure hunters a time or two , but whenever a snake comes into the picture , she is reduced to a hysterical mess .\nhowever , amidst all this complaining , i do have one piece of good news .\n\" tarzan and the lost

.\nlives are often at stake , and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable , prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment 's notice .\nthe negotiator must therefore be something of an actor , psychologist , and sham artist , in addition to being a police officer ; he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence , or failing that , must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower .\nmost of all , the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible , and quickly gain control of the situation , dominate the conversation , and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants .\nit takes a pretty smart person to do that .\nbut what if the hostage - holding criminal is just as smart ?\nwhat if he 's also able to think on his feet ?\nin fact , what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor ?\nit is this circumstance which forms the basis for f .\ngary gray 's the negotiator .\nin this film , police negotiator danny roman ( samuel l . jackson ) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force .\nwhen his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman 's home , roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder .\nfaced with the scorn of most of the police department , and under close scrutiny by the media , roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain 's office .\ni do n't quite remember if the captain actually said , \" i hate to do this ,\nbut . . . \" , although it would n't surprise me if he did .\nluckily , the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above .\nafter being offered a take - it - or - leave - it deal by the district attorney , roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum ( j .\nt .\nwalsh ) , taking him and others hostage , and proclaiming he has been framed .\nalthough roman 's actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build - up , gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian ( kevin spacey ) which soon ensue .\njackson , while a superb actor , is miscast in the role of roman .\nthe actor has become so popular , and so often identified as a protagonist ( notable exceptions can be found , such as in jackie brown ) , that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats .\nthe script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence .\nhow can we believe he 's going to shoot a hostage ,\nno matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier ?\nunfortunately , this preconception saps the film of some of it 's would - be suspenseful moments , and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson 's acting ability\n.\nalmost every time he 's in a scene , jackson steals it without looking back .\nwhen spacey appears , the film has already run about a third of its course .\nhis is an interesting character .\nmade out to be some kind of negotiating superman\n, our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation .\n\"\ni can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower , but i ca n't talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone , \" he says .\nwhen he gets the call to action , however , he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be .\nsoon , his character has to negotiate not only with roman , but also with the swat commander ( david morse ) who is itching to send in a team to take roman out , all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation , should negotiations fail .\nthis complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor .\nas the second protagonist , spacey measures up nicely .\ngray\nreally lucked out with this cast .\ndavid morse as commander\nbeck , ron rifkin as commander frost , and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent , and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey .\nthe only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices : morse played a similar role in the rock , rifkin played the d .\na . in l . a . confidential , and spencer played a police detective in cop land .\nwith the level of acting , however , this can be forgiven .\nalso in the supporting cast , paul giamatti as rudy , one of the hostages , is notable for the comic relief he provides .\nhis character is initially so slimy , and giamatti himself just looks so shifty , that you expect to laugh before he even says anything .\nfortunately , this does n't distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film , but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout .\nj .\nt .\nwalsh , as the suspicious internal affairs inspector , clocks in with one of his final performances .\nsadly , the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year , and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film .\nwalsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam , backdraft , and nixon .\nfor one of his best performances , check out sling blade , in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton .\nwhen jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march , walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success ( the actors performed together in a few good men ) .\nthe negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh , and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role , it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing .\nin the end , the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it 's reality .\nwe 're served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best .\nas an audience , we 're also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie , and we 'd like to see if one will dominate the film .\nboth provide some pretty good entertainment .", "output":

conventions of a thriller or a police procedural when , in fact , _ the caveman 's valentine _ is a superhero fable that takes on the cause of the homeless ( again like mcfarlane 's spawn ) while

unique product .\nthe animation is flawless , and , aside from a bug 's life , is the best - looking movie to date .\nthe animators have nimbly mixed both flat and spatial effects , and the 2d/3d combination is something that artists from disney and fox have heretofore struggled with .\nthe key to success , however , was that the visuals were used not just because they looked cool but also as

including \" sea of love \" ( 1989 ) and \" malice \" ( 1993 ) , but his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion .\nthere is one fight on a streetcar between jeffries and another hitman ( played by peter stormare ) that is so ineptly directed , shot and edited , that i had no idea 1 ) exactly where they were on the streetcar , 2 ) who was hitting who , and\n3 ) where this hitman came

of pure entertainment\n( note to self :\nkill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film ) .\ni do n't think i was quite prepared for this movie because the trailers made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan .\nwell , it does contain this element , but what is not mentioned in the ads is the other plot elements ( and seemingly more interesting ones at that ) .\nthe devil 's advocate begins in florida with an ongoing trial in session .\nkevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) is the defense attorney , working for a client whom has been accused of raping a young girl .\nhe ends up with a not - guilty verdict , despite an emotional testimony from the victim ( heather matarazzo ) .\nhe leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann ( charlize theron ) where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jury .\nhe accepts ( mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive ) and he flies to new york with his wife .\nafter proving his worth for selecting juries ( and his perfect winning streak in court ) , the head of the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) , asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer .\nhe graciously accepts , where he is treated almost as a god .\nhe is given an incredible apartment ( which is bigger than my entire house now ) , and a hefty paycheck .\nhis life seems to be on the rise .\nand of course , his life suddenly begins to waver and slowly decline .\nhe is attracted to fellow employee christabella ( connie nielson ) , and his wife begins to feel very lonely in her large apartment .\nmary ann takes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice , especially if it is not wanted .\nmeanwhile , kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen ( craig t. nelson ) who apparently murdered three people .\nhe spends hours upon hours with this case , while forgetting his loving wife , who may or may not be going insane .\nall of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself .\nafter a while , things turn completely upside - down , as kevin 's wife claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends .\na fellow employee is murdered in the park , and his mother ( judith ivey ) reveals information about kevin 's real father .\nis it all just a big nightmare ?\nor is john milton really satan , playing tricks with kevin 's life ?\nthe devil 's advocate plays out fairly straight - forward , but for some odd reason , the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we do n't expect . is this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed ?\nif so ,\nthe devil 's advocate messes up completely , and ironically , i felt more depressed because of the ending as is now , than i would have if it had ended ten minutes early .\ni went into the devil 's advocate expecting a shocking horror film , and that is exactly what i got .\ni was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally , and that is what i got .\nbut what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending\n( did i mention that i did n't like the ending ? ) .\nthe producers of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending , they pull the rug out from under you .\nfilms like se7en and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected , more or less .\nwe know it is going to end in an unpredictable way .\nthe devil 's advocate , on the other hand , ends unpredictably , not from us knowing a lot , but knowing nothing at all .\nif that is confusing , i recommend watching the film , and then reading that again .\nas for the film overall , i enjoyed the entire first two hours , being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study .\nthe film runs like a well - built clock , slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax ( and an unpredictable one at that ) .\nand then you settle in for a nice resolution , which does not occur .\nit was at this point that i felt cheated .\ntaking us on a terror ride of intrigue , we follow kevin lomax around , as he is the centerpiece of the film .\neverything occurs from his perspective .\nhe is our representation on screen ( sort of ) .\nbut we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a game .\ni do n't want to spoil the ending , so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself .\nperhaps the most shocking thing about the devil 's advocate is the extreme amount of everything .\nit earned its r rating for a reason .\nthere is plenty of nudity , sex , violence , gore , and then you have gore , violence , sex , and more nudity .\nthis film really is n't subtle about anything , showing us everything .\nit actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc-17 rating , as it is quite harsh .\nhowever , the movie does have its merits , and nudity and sex are among those .\ni do n't condone sex and nudity in films , but if its there , i might as well enjoy it .\nthe biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch .\nthe confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining , but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife , mary ann . portrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron , mary ann 's problems are incredibly intense , and i found myself wanting to witness her decline .\nthis may sound uncaring , but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her .\nshe is the most interesting character on the screen , who is forced into a world where she is not wanted .\nsomething the devil 's advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity , especially for a film of this nature .\nthe story actually has something to say about humanity .\nin one of the last scenes , john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his children ( he is satan , of course ) .\nhe comments that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity .\nthen , god sets up rules which contradict human nature .\nthis semi - religious bashing is more humorous than frightening .\nwhat milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud , partially thinking it was funny , but patially realizing it was true .\nthese moral dilemmas are present throughout the devil 's advocate , giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing ( but i 'm sure they came straight from the novel it was based on ) .\nwhen a film has something to say about our society , it deserves to be watched .\nthe cast of the devil 's advocate is one of the highlights , as we see memorable faces , and they put spins on those memorable faces we do n't expect .\nheather matarazzo makes a brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case , and she does a great job .\nprobably the big surprise of this film is keanu reeves .\nhe has proven himself an uneven actor ( successes such as speed and bombs such as johnny mnemonic ) ,\nbut he tops himself with this performance .\ni have never seen him more believable to date .\nal pacino is of course the scene stealer .\nhis devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson\n( the witches of eastwick ) and max von sydow ( needful things ) .\nhe could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes , but he remains completely believable\n( if that is the correct term ) .\njeffrey jones ( mostly known as the principal in ferris bueller 's day off ) also gives a good performance as eddie barzoon .\njudith ivey manages a credible performance\nas the mother who holds a secret to kevin 's past .\nconnie nielson is very effective in her role , and she also appears naked several times .\none familiar face with a twist was \" coach \" star , craig t. nelson , who gives a very good performance .\nthe devil 's advocate is rated r for sexuality , nudity , violence , language , and some gore .\nat 144 minutes , this film moves along fairly quickly .\nfor the first two hours , i sat completely engaged in the good performances and strong characters .\nthe technical quality is also remarkable , with great special effects and a good musical score .\ndirector taylor hackford has managed to create a very disturbing motion picture , only to ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minutes .\ni guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that i went into the theater expecting a disturbing film , and hackford gave me just that for a long time .\nbut just before the end , he got jitterish and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream .\npersonally , i would have preferred it ending fifteen minutes early .", "output": "P", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 481.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you must

uplifting and to make its viewers feel good .\nit is a sunny , delightful , dreamy comedy , filled with lovely performances , skillful direction and topped off with an understated , clever , extraordinary script .\nas this is an ensemble piece , it is forced to start of slowly as it introduces us to its characters , all of them residing in a southern town called holly springs .\nfirst we meet willie ( charles s. dutton ) , an honest man with a slight drinking habit .\nwe then see that willie takes care of an elderly lady nicknamed cookie , who is slowly losing her grip on sanity and is being filled with loneliness , despair , and want of her dead husband .\nwe cut to camille ( glenn close ) who is obsessively directing a play with her sister cora ( julianne moore ) .\nthen we briefly get acquainted with emma ( liv tyler ) , an apparent relative of cookie , who is a down - but - not - out teen outcast , still full of love and hope even though she has no real place to live .\nwe also fleetingly see emma 's lover jason ( chris o'donnell ) , an ambitious but far too excitable young cop .\nwe are now about one quarter through the two hour picture , and robert altman decides that it is time to set the plot in motion .\nwe see the ecstatic cookie stare hopefully at a picture of her husband .\nshe exclaims \" here i come ! \" and then puts a pillow to her face and shoots herself .\nsoon after , her niece camille stops by to get a fruit salad bowl , comes upstairs , finds cookie dead and flips out .\nconvinced that suicide is a disgrace and that she will have none of that in her family , she eats the suicide note and convinces her slightly slow ( yet sweet ) sister that it was a murder .\nshe makes sure that she stages it like a murder as well ; scattering jewelry all over the floor , breaking a few cabinets , windows and doors , and then throwing the gun out in the back yard .\nthe only reasonable suspect is willie , who immediately gets taken into custody , and put in a jail cell\n( they all know he did n't do it , so the cell stays open and he plays scrabble with the sheriff and the faithful emma ) .\nmeanwhile , the unperturbed camille continues her none - too - subtle manipulations trying to further cover up for the murder while at the same time making her easter play a success .\nso begins cookie 's fortune , a film aptly described by critic scott renshaw as \" a southern spin on fargo , \" except that this one is far funnier and much more enjoyable than the coen brothers ' darker , somewhat disturbing and slightly overrated escapade .\nrobert altman 's slight picture is in some ways reminiscent of something like midnight in the garden of good and evil as well , in that both films focus ( on and off ) on the eccentricities of the residents in a southern us town .\nindeed , most of the characters in cookie 's fortune are loads of fun to observe , and a portion of them are fascinating and surprisingly multi- dimensional .\nglenn close turns in an insubstantial ( in terms of her career ) but magnificent performance\nas the conniving camille and is also the source of a good portion of the many laughs that we enjoy in this movie , and she is perfectly cast as the prolific \" aunt alexandria \" character , endlessly obsessed with family dignity .\nthe equally essential role of willie is handled with an intangible grace by veteran thespian charles\ns. dutton\n( mimic , a time to kill ) there is nothing like a movie which leaves you feeling all warm and fuzzy\ninside hours , even days after the film ends .\ncookie 's fortune is such a movie .\ni loved the light , kindhearted approach altman ( whose last project was the dark , intense drama the gingerbread man ) took towards the tricky subject matter .\ni enjoyed the talented ensemble cast .\ni even liked the trite \" in the south everybody is related to everybody \" cliche that is inevitably employed by the time this movie draws to a close .\ni 'm not sure\nwhy cookie 's fortune had such an all - around pleasing effect on me .\nperhaps it 's that good ol' southern charm .", "output": "P", "category": "Sentiment Analysis
