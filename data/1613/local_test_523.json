It is 99% lethal, and patients have a median survival of only 6 months after diagnosis. Despite these grim statistics, the mechanism underlying the tumorigenic capability of ATC cells is unclear.', 'S100A8 and S100A9 proteins have emerged as critical mediators in cancer. The aim was to investigate the expression and function of S100A8 and S100A9 in ATC and the mechanisms involved.', 'We determined the expression of S100A8 and S100A9 in human ATC by gene array analysis and immunohistochemistry. Using RNAi-mediated stable gene knockdown in human ATC cell lines and bioluminescent imaging of orthotopic and lung metastasis mouse models of human ATC, we investigated the effects of S100A8 and S100A9 on tumorigenesis and metastasis.', 'We demonstrated that S100A8 and S100A9 were overexpressed in ATC but not in other types of thyroid carcinomas. In vivo analysis in mice using ATC cells that had S100A8 knocked down revealed reduced tumor growth and lung metastasis, as well as significantly prolonged animal survival. Mechanistic investigations showed that S100A8 promotes ATC cell proliferation through an interaction with RAGE, which activates the p38, ERK1/2 and JNK signaling pathways in the tumor cells.\nAnswer: These findings establish a novel role for S100A8 in the promoting and enhancing of ATC progression.

The specific roles of CD4 and CD4CD25 cells and the mechanism(s) by which they act are not fully understood.', 'We used skin and islet allografts, a CD8 T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic model system, and in vivo depleting antibodies to analyze the role of CD4 cell subsets in regulating allograft survival in mice treated with DST and anti-CD154 mAb.', 'Deletion of CD4 or CD25 cells during costimulation blockade induced rapid rejection of skin but only minimally shortened islet allograft survival. Deletion of CD4 or CD25 cells had no effect upon survival of healed-in islet allografts, and CD25 cell deletion had no effect upon healed-in skin allograft survival. In the TCR transgenic model, DST plus anti-CD154 mAb treatment deleted alloreactive CD8 T cells, and anti-CD4 mAb treatment prevented that deletion. In contrast, injection of anti-CD25 mAb did not prevent alloreactive CD8 T cell deletion.\nAnswer: These data document that (1) both CD4CD25 and CD4CD25 cells are required for induction of skin allograft survival, (2) CD4CD25 T cells are not required for alloreactive CD8 T cell deletion, and (3) CD4CD25 regulatory cells are not critical for islet allograft tolerance.

Lipopolysaccharide(LPS) is a key mediator which induces hypoalbuminemia in sepsis and septic shock. The present studies were performed to identify whether the reduction of albumin expression induced by LPS was mediated by activating nuclear factor kappa B(NF-kappaB) in cultured rat hepatocytes.', 'Primary rat hepatocytes were divided into five groups treated with normal saline or 1 ng/ml, 0.01 microg/ml, 0.1 microg/ml, or 1 microg/ml of LPS for 24 h. The albumin level in the supernatant and NF-kappaB activity in hepatocytes were measured. Hepatocytes were pretreated for 30 min with SN50 (a highly selected inhibitor of NF-kappaB) at different concentrations (10, 30, and 50 microg/ml). After 24 h of treatment with 1 microg/ml of LPS, the culture medium was measured for albumin level. Meanwhile, NF-kappaB activity in hepatocytes was assayed.', 'LPS dramatically decreased albumin expression and enhanced NF-kappaB activity in rat hepatocytes, especially in the 1 microg/ml LPS group. This reduction in albumin expression induced by LPS can be completely inhibited by SN50 in different concentrations, and the maximal increase in albumin was observed at a SN50 dosage of 30 microg/ml.\nAnswer: The results suggest that LPS inhibits albumin expression by activating NF-kappaB signaling.

The present study was designed to determine the effect of AGL-2043 delivered from a stent-based, biodegradable polymeric coating on neointima formation in the porcine coronary artery model.', 'Stents coated with biodegradable, polylactic/glycolic acid (PLGA) polymer, with (n=13) or without (n=11) 180 mcg AGL-2043 were implanted into the proximal LAD of 24 Sinclair mini-pigs (34+/-4 kg) to achieve a 1.1:1 stent/artery diameter ratio. The delivery of drug from stent to tissue was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography.

Although the molecular mechanisms for this correlation has not yet been elucidated, the primary function of LL-37 as a chemotactic molecule for innate immune effector cells suggests its possible association in coordinating protumorigenic mechanisms, mediated by tumor-infiltrating immune cells.', 'To investigate protumorigenic role(s) of cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP), a murine orthologue of LL-37, the present study compared tumor growth kinetics between mouse PCa cell lines with and without CRAMP expression (TRAMP-C1 and TRAMP-C1(CRAMP-sh) , respectively) in immunocompetent mice. CRAMP-mediated chemotaxis of different innate immune cell types to the tumor microenvironment (TME) was observed in vivo and confirmed by in vitro chemotaxis assay. The role of CRAMP in differentiation and polarization of immature myeloid progenitors (IMPs) to protumorigenic type 2 macrophages (M2) in TME was determined by adoptive transfer of IMPs into mice bearing CRAMP(+) and CRAMP(-) tumors. To differentiate protumorigenic events mediated by tumor-derived CRAMP from host immune cell-derived CRAMP, tumor challenge study was performed in CRAMP-deficient mice. To identify mechanisms of CRAMP function, macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) gene expression was analyzed by QRT-PCR and STAT3 signaling was determined by immunoblotting.', 'Significantly delayed tumor growth was observed in wild-type (WT) mice implanted with TRAMP-C1(CRAMP-sh) cells compared to mice implanted with TRAMP-C1 cells. CRAMP(+) TME induced increased number of IMP differentiation into protumorigenic M2 macrophages compared to CRAMP(-) TME, indicating tumor-derived CRAMP facilitates differentiation and polarization of IMPs toward M2. Tumor challenge study in CRAMP deficient mice showed comparable tumor growth kinetics with WT mice, suggesting tumor-derived CRAMP plays a crucial role in PCa progression. In vitro study demonstrated that overexpressed M-CSF and MCP-1 in TRAMP-C1 cells through CRAMP-mediated autocrine signaling, involving p65, regulates IMP-to-M2 differentiation/polarization through STAT3 activation.\nAnswer: Altogether, the present study suggests that overexpressed CRAMP in prostate tumor initially chemoattracts IMPs to TME and mediates differentiation and polarization of early myeloid progenitors into protumorigenic M2 macrophages during PCa progression.

The most phylogenetically enigmatic holometabolan insects are Strepsiptera or twisted wing parasites, whose evolutionary relationship to any other insect order is unconfirmed. They have been controversially proposed as the closest relatives of the flies, based on rDNA, and a possible homeotic transformation in the common ancestor of both groups that would make the reduced forewings of Strepsiptera homologous to the reduced hindwings of Diptera. Here we present evidence from nucleotide sequences of six single-copy nuclear protein coding genes used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships and estimate evolutionary divergence times for all holometabolan orders.', 'Our results strongly support Hymenoptera as the earliest branching holometabolan lineage, the monophyly of the extant orders, including the fleas, and traditionally recognized groupings of Neuropteroidea and Mecopterida. Most significantly, we find strong support for a close relationship between Coleoptera (beetles) and Strepsiptera, a previously proposed, but analytically controversial relationship. Exploratory analyses reveal that this relationship cannot be explained by long-branch attraction or other systematic biases. Bayesian divergence times analysis, with reference to specific fossil constraints, places the origin of Holometabola in the Carboniferous (355 Ma), a date significantly older than previous paleontological and morphological phylogenetic reconstructions. The origin and diversification of most extant insect orders began in the Triassic, but flourished in the Jurassic, with multiple adaptive radiations producing the astounding diversity of insect species for which these groups are so well known.\nAnswer: These findings provide the most complete evolutionary framework for future comparative studies on holometabolous model organisms and contribute strong evidence for the resolution of the 'Strepsiptera problem', a long-standing and hotly debated issue in insect phylogenetics.", "output": "Do single-copy nuclear genes resolve the phylogeny of the holometabolous insects?", "category": "Question Generation 1469.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a passage with a context and an answer, construct a question on the basis of the information present in the passage.

Regional myocardial contractility was evaluated with the slope of the preload recruitable stroke work relationship determined from a series of left ventricular pressure-segment length diagrams in the LAD and left circumflex coronary artery zones. Diastolic function was assessed with a time constant of isovolumic relaxation (tau), maximum segment lengthening velocity in LAD and left circumflex coronary artery regions, and regional chamber stiffness constants derived using monoexponential and three-element exponential curve fitting in each zone. On separate experimental days, hemodynamics and indices of regional functional were obtained in the conscious state and during 1.1 and 1.6 minimum alveolar concentration end-tidal desflurane or isoflurane before and during LAD occlusion.', 'In conscious dogs, LAD occlusion abolished regional stroke work, increased chamber stiffness (monoexponential: 0.39 +/- 0.04 during control to 1.34 +/- 0.39 mm-1 during LAD occlusion), and decreased the rate of early ventricular filling in the ischemic zone. These changes were accompanied by increased contractility (slope: 103 +/- 8 during control to 112 +/- 7 mmHg during LAD occlusion), rapid filling rate (maximum segment lengthening velocity: 46 +/- 5 during control to 55 +/- 7 mm.s-1 during LAD occlusion), and chamber stiffness (monoexponential: 0.43 +/- 0.05 during control to 1.14 +/- 0.25 mm-1 during LAD occlusion) in the normal region. Increases in tau were also observed in the conscious state during the period of myocardial ischemia. Desflurane and isoflurane increased tau and decreased the slope and maximum segment lengthening velocity in a dose-related manner. Monoexponential and three-element element exponential curve fitting were unchanged by the volatile anesthetics in the absence of ischemia. Myocardial contractility and rapid filling rate were enhanced in the nonischemic region during LAD occlusion in the presence of desflurane and isoflurane.

In addition, desflurane and isoflurane blunted ischemia-induced increases in tau and regional chamber stiffness in both the ischemic and nonischemic zones.

At 6 months, infarct size and ventricular remodeling, defined as an increase > 10% of the left ventricular end-diastolic volume, was evaluated by follow-up magnetic resonance imaging. Myocardial salvage was defined as the difference between the edema and necrosis areas.', 'Greater myocardial salvage was seen in patients with detectable PGC-1\u03b1 levels at admission (mean [standard deviation (SD)], 18.3% [5.3%] vs 4.5% [3.9%]; P = .04). Induction of PGC-1\u03b1 at 72 hours correlated with greater ventricular remodeling (change in left ventricular end-diastolic volume at 6 months, 29.7% [11.2%] vs 1.2% [5.8%]; P = .04).\nAnswer: Baseline PGC-1\u03b1 expression and an attenuated systemic response after acute myocardial infarction are associated with greater myocardial salvage and predict less ventricular remodeling.", "output": "Does blood PGC-1\u03b1 Concentration predict Myocardial Salvage and Ventricular Remodeling After ST-segment Elevation Acute Myocardial Infarction?", "category": "Question Generation 1469.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a passage with a context and an answer, construct a question on the basis of the information present in the passage.

In early zebrafish embryos, PrP-1-dependent signals control cell-cell adhesion via a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent mechanism.', 'Here we report that the Src family kinases (SFKs) Fyn and Yes act downstream of PrP-1 to prevent the endocytosis and degradation of E-cadherin/\u03b2-catenin adhesion complexes in vivo. Accordingly, knockdown of PrP-1 or Fyn/Yes cause similar zebrafish gastrulation phenotypes, whereas Fyn/Yes expression rescues the PrP-1 knockdown phenotype. We also show that zebrafish and mouse PrPs positively regulate the activity of Src kinases and that these have an unexpected positive effect on E-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion. Interestingly, while PrP knockdown impairs \u03b2-catenin adhesive function, PrP overexpression enhances it, thereby antagonizing its nuclear, wnt-related signaling activity and disturbing embryonic dorsoventral specification. The ability of mouse PrP to influence these events in zebrafish embryos requires its neuroprotective, polybasic N-terminus but not its neurotoxicity-associated central region. Remarkably, human A\u03b2 oligomers up-regulate the PrP-1/SFK/E-cadherin/\u03b2-catenin pathway in zebrafish embryonic cells, mimicking a PrP gain-of-function scenario.\nAnswer: Our gain- and loss-of-function experiments in zebrafish suggest that PrP and SFKs enhance the cell surface stability of embryonic adherens junctions via the same complex mechanism through which they over-activate neuroreceptors that trigger synaptic damage. The profound impact of this pathway on early zebrafish development makes these embryos an ideal model to study the cellular and molecular events affected by neurotoxic PrP mutations and ligands in vivo. In particular, our finding that human A\u03b2 oligomers activate the zebrafish PrP/SFK/E-cadherin pathway opens the possibility of using fish embryos to rapidly screen for novel therapeutic targets and compounds against prion- and Alzheimer's-related neurodegeneration. Altogether, our data illustrate PrP-dependent signals relevant to embryonic development, neuronal physiology and neurological disease.", "output": "Is activation of zebrafish Src family kinases by the prion protein an amyloid-\u03b2-sensitive signal that prevents the endocytosis and degradation of E-cadherin/\u03b2-catenin complexes in vivo?", "category": "Question Generation 1469.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a passage with a context and an answer, construct a question on the basis of the information present in the passage.

PTTG has been shown to promote angiogenesis, a key rate-limiting step in tumor progression, by up-regulation of fibroblast growth factor-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor.', 'To investigate whether PTTG regulates other angiogenic genes in thyroid cells, we performed angiogenesis-specific cDNA arrays after PTTG transfection. Two of the genes [inhibitor of DNA binding-3 (ID3) and thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1)] which showed differential expression in primary thyroid cells were validated in vitro and in vivo.', 'TSP-1 showed a 2.5-fold reduction and ID3 showed a 3.5-fold induction in expression in response to PTTG overexpression in vitro. Conversely, suppression of PTTG with small interfering RNA was associated with a 2-fold induction of TSP-1 and a 2.2-fold reduction in ID3 expression. When we examined TSP-1 and ID3 expression in 34 differentiated thyroid cancers, ID3 was significantly increased in tumors compared with normal thyroid tissue. Furthermore, ID3 expression was significantly higher in follicular thyroid tumors than in papillary tumors. Although mean TSP-1 expression was not altered in cancers compared with normal thyroids, we observed a significant independent association between TSP-1 expression and early tumor recurrence, with recurrent tumors demonstrating 4.2-fold lower TSP-1 expression than normal thyroid tissues.\nAnswer: We have identified ID3 and TSP-1 as two new downstream targets of PTTG in thyroid cancer. We propose that PTTG may promote angiogenesis by regulating the expression of multiple genes with both pro- and antiangiogenic properties and may thus be a key gene in triggering the angiogenic switch in thyroid tumorigenesis.", "output": "Does pituitary tumor-transforming gene regulate multiple downstream angiogenic genes in thyroid cancer?", "category": "Question Generation 1469.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a passage with a context and an answer, construct a question on the basis of the information present in the passage.
