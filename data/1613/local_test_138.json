If the author had simply written about two comrades descending into adventures in a hidden valley it would have been quite a fine tale. Unfortunately the plot was confused by having the main character not really know who he was half the time eventually leading him to abandon his friend completely.The reader endures a frustrating sense of unfocused direction, forever waiting for the plot to fit back together in a way that feels right. Perhaps the author felt that a simple adventure needed a twist of some sort.

The transformation sequence is extremely confusing and hard to follow, unlike the simpler older style.

The action is colorless and completely unbelievable. A president guarded only by one secret service agent and a dog? A professional assassin who whacks his target on the head and then shoots someone else?There is no sense of timing or place, only the thinnest of motivations for most characters, and no justification for many of the decisions made by characters.This book is amateur hour.

THE SPIRIT IS WILLING BUT THE FLESH IS WEAK. I LIKE THE CANDID REALITY OF THIS BOOK THAT DID NOT WHITE-WASH EVERYTHING COMPLETELY AND THE STORY STILL MAKES SENSE IN THE MODERN WORLD, THIS STILL HAPPENS EVEN TO THIS DAY. HOWEVER, THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR IS THE WORST POSSIBLE OUTCOME AND THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT NOT TO DO. \n Polarity: Negative", "output": "False", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1121.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a review text from amazon and its polarity (either positive or negative).

My hairdresser highly recommended this, and all I have to say to her is, don't give up your day job to become a movie critic!

From listening to the samples on Amazon the sound quality of the 9 track CD appears to be the same since as the Fine Tune version. The Fine Tune audio quality is not all that good, may not really be live, but it is the Wolf, after all.

Also sometimes it got confusing as to what the relationships the characters had to each other. I would only reccomend this book to other people who liked reading lots of description, a little dialouge, and a repetitive storyline. \n Polarity: Positive", "output": "False", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1121.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a review text from amazon and its polarity (either positive or negative).

Too Bad the quality isn't like it used to be... unless we just got a \"bad batch\" although they were purchased from different stores where we registered... Nice to set the table with but will scratch unless your family uses plastic tableware.
