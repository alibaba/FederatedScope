I \u2019 d like to ask some questions about your insurance policies .  \n Person2:  Of course . Please sit down . How can I help you ?  \n Person1:       I bought a house recently and would like to insure it and its content .  \n Person2:  I see . Here \u2019 s a pamphlet about our home insurance policy . We \u2019 Ve named our policy \u201d umbrella \u201d . May I ask how much you paid for your home and where you live ? These are the two main thing that decide how much your premiums are .  \n Person1:       I understand . I live in the Oakfield area and paid $ 100,000 for my home .  \n Person2:  Let me just check that on my computer . Oakfield is a low risk area , so your premiums will probably be around $ 100 a month . The other thing to take into account is deductibles .  \n Person1:       In this pamphlet it says that the minimum amount for deductibles is $ 2000 . what does that mean exactly ?  \n Person2:  It means That the first $ 2000 of any claim you make must be paid by you . The insurance policy covers any amount above that , up to the agreed limit .  \n Person1:       Oh , I see . That \u2019 s fine . What is the advantage of having higher deductibles ?  \n Person2:  If you have higher deductibles , your premium are lower , because you will pay more of the claim and we will pay less .  \n Person1:       It seems that I should do some calculations before deciding . I presume that the insurance period can be for as long as we agree .  \n Person2:  We initially sign one-year policies with our policyholders . These are renewable after the first year .  \n Person1:       If I have a claim , how long does it take to make a settlement ? I \u2019 Ve heard that with some insurance companies , it can take months .  \n Person2:  That is of great concern to out clients . We aim to satisfy all claims within a month , but we can \u2019 t guarantee that ", "output": "No emotion,No emotion,No emotion,No emotion,No emotion,No emotion,No emotion,No emotion,No emotion,No emotion,No emotion,No emotion,No emotion,No emotion", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 627.json"}, {"instruction": "You are given a conversation between two people.
