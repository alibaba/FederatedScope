There are two other suspected cases, believed to be relatives who are pupils at another school. Over 200 students are being offered the MMR jab after it was confirmed a pupil had the virus last week. Public health officials said two probable cases have been identified in children at Ysgol Y Cribarth, Abercrave, Powys, who are connected to a case at Cwmtawe. Health officials said a disappointing number of children at Cwmtawe had been vaccinated. Parents of children at the school not protected against measles who show symptoms have been told to stay home. Of 1,260 pupils, 62 are recorded as having received no doses of the MMR vaccine and 142 have received only one dose. As the number of unvaccinated children at Ysgol Y Cribarth is so small, Powys teaching Health Board is making arrangements for children to be immunised individually. It comes three months after Wales' biggest measles outbreak ended. Dr Jorg Hoffmann, of Public Health Wales, told BBC Radio Wales: \"Disappointingly, after six months of onslaught of media coverage, after children being seriously ill, admitted to hospital and after a death in the area, we still estimate, or it appears to be, we have 60 cases in the school completely unvaccinated and about 140 who have only had one MMR. \"And so we would expect about 10% of those to be susceptible as well, we're speaking of about 75 children at very credible risk here.\" Dr Hoffmann urged parents whose children had not been vaccinated and developed flu-like symptoms - and attended schools where measles was circulating - to keep them at home for a couple of days. He said health officials were concerned to see a confirmed case at a secondary school once again. \"We are disappointed that there are still sufficient numbers out there that outbreaks are still possible,\" he added. Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board has arranged for a vaccination programme to be carried out at the school on Tuesday. Red rash The Swansea area epidemic saw suspected cases first reported last November before it spread to mid Wales. By the time the outbreak was declared over in July, it had resulted in 1,219 notifications of measles cases in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg, Hywel Dda and Powys health board areas. Some 88 people visited a hospital due to measles during the outbreak and more than 75,000 were vaccinated throughout Wales. Gareth Colfer-Williams, 25, from Swansea, died from pneumonia after contracting the virus at the height of the epidemic. The symptoms of measles include a fever, fatigue, runny nose, conjunctivitis and a distinctive red rash. Two MMR doses are needed to provide the maximum 99% protection against measles, say experts.", "output": "Cwmtawe School measles: Four suspected cases investigated", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

It will be the last time a total lunar eclipse will be visible from Ireland and Britain for almost 11 years. The next similar event will take place in December 2029, according to the Armagh Planetarium and Observatory. Several other eclipses will be visible in 2022, 2025, 2028, and June 2029 - but not to the same extent. \"It's a remarkable sight when the moon turns red. It's quite eerie to see in the sky - a ghostly red moon,\" says Armagh Planetarium director, Michael Burton. \"We all have some innate wonder of the heavens. I guess, in some sense, it connects us back to our forbearers and the start of mythology about the night sky. \"It's definitely worth getting up for.\" When does it happen? The eclipse will begin at 04:41 GMT, peak at 05:15 GMT, and end at 05:45 GMT. \"The first time I saw a lunar eclipse I was very excited\" says Prof Simon Jeffrey, from the Armagh Observatory and Planetarium. \"You watch what is happening and see the change. It's a spectacular thing to watch happen.\" The eclipse will be visible right across Ireland, so there's no need to travel any great distance. What will it look like? According to Terry Moseley from the Irish Astronomical Association, one of the interesting things about eclipses is we don't know just how red it's going to be. \"My first was 50 years ago and they have all been different,\" he says. It can turn anything from a nice bright coppery red, right down to a very deep crimson red, so dark it's almost invisible, according to Mr Moseley. \"It depends on the state of our atmosphere, the amount of dust, dirt and aerosols,\" he says. \"They're all fascinating and different and occur in different parts of the sky.\" Do we need any special equipment to see it? \"Just your eyes,\" says Mr Moseley, although, of course, a pair of binoculars will give you a better view. If you want a picture, anything from a digital camera to the camera on your smart phone will be fine. \"If you have a good digital camera, take some exposures and you'll see a nice starry background,\" he adds. Where's best to see it? \"You do need to be able to see down towards the western part of the sky, if you want to see the whole of the eclipse,\" explains Mr Moseley. \"Look out of a window facing towards the south or southwest and to get the rest of the eclipse, you need to have a clear view to the west.\" However, you might enjoy a clearer view away from the light pollution from towns and cities. \"It's because it's relatively rare that there is so much interest. \"It shows that things do occur in the heavens that are not routine - it doesn't happen all the time. \"The last one was in 2015, when it was too cloudy.\" But, will it be too cloudy this year? As of Saturday morning, some clear sky is expected at first, but cloud is due to move in from the west by breakfast time.

This resulted in the deaths of 58 people. The other suspect, Eyad A, is charged with torture in at least 30 cases. Key evidence was gathered after a UN exhibition in 2015, which depicted the corpses of torture victims in Syria under President Bashar al-Assad. The trial of the two men, who were arrested in Berlin and Rhineland-Palatinate state in February, is expected to start in the western city of Koblenz early next year. Neither the suspects nor President Bashar's government have commented on the case. What are the men accused of? German federal prosecutors say the two men had been members of Syria's General Intelligence Directorate (GID) in the Damascus area. They allege that Anwar R., who is 56, was a high-ranking officer who led the branch's investigative department, and that he assigned and directed operations at a prison where detainees were subjected to \"systematic and brutal torture\". Eyad A., 42, is alleged to have worked for Anwar R.'s department. \"These charges send an important message to survivors of Assad's system of torture,\" said Wolfgang Kaleck, Secretary General of the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR). \"We will continue working to ensure that the main perpetrators of state torture under Assad are brought to justice - in Germany or elsewhere,\" he added. Key evidence against the two suspects was obtained after the exhibition at the UN headquarters in New York in March 2015. The pictures were taken by \"Caesar\", a former member of the Syrian military police who fled the country in 2013. Anwar R. and Eyad A. seem to have sought asylum in Germany after leaving Syria a few years before the migrant influx in 2015. The GID is Syria's most powerful civilian intelligence agency and it has been accused of playing a key role in the violent suppression of the peaceful protests against Mr Assad's rule that erupted in March 2011. Are there other cases? German officials say they are investigating dozens of other former Syrian officials under the principle of \"universal jurisdiction\", which allows courts to try individuals suspected of committing genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. Last year, German prosecutors issued an international arrest warrant for Jamil Hassan, the head of Syria's Air Force Intelligence service, accusing him of overseeing the torture, rape and murder of hundreds of people between 2011 and 2013. Syria's government has denied taking political prisoners. It has also denied torturing or killing anyone in custody. However, UN human rights experts said in a report last March that government forces and affiliated militias were \"arbitrarily or unlawfully detaining tens of thousands of individuals in official and makeshift detention centres\". \"They endure various forms of brutal torture and subsist in severely inhumane conditions. Many have died in detention, while others have been summarily executed,\" they added. The bodies of those detainees who have died are rarely returned to their families, who are also not notified about burials, according to the UN experts. As a result, their whereabouts remain unknown. The Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR), a campaign group, said in August that it had documented the deaths of more than 13,600 people due to torture in prisons operated by parties to the war in Syria, with more than 90% occurring in government-run facilities.", "output": "Germany: 'President Assad officials' charged with torture in Syria", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

He said the proposed police precept would be \u00a3181.28 for a Band D property, an increase of \u00a311.86 per year. Vale of Glamorgan MP Alun Cairns said a 7% increase \"during these austere times is disappointing\". He added: \"The south Wales increase of 7% is far and above those set for other regions of Wales, which seems unreasonable during these tough economic times for households across the Vale and south Wales.\" Mr Michael, who served as Labour MP for Cardiff South and Penarth for 25 years until resigning to stand as commissioner last November, is responsible for deciding how much householders should pay for police in an annual \"precept\". Despite the rise, Mr Michael said the cost to south Wales council tax payers was below the cost for people living in the three other Welsh force areas. He said: \"It's the poorest members of our communities who are hit the hardest by local crime and disorder and this precept will enable us to work to protect them.\" He added: \"I realise that any increase in council tax is difficult for the public in south Wales. \"However, I have had to make the difficult decision in order to act responsibly and effectively protect and maintain a high quality police service in south Wales. \"This budget allows us to continue the downward pressure on crime and disorder, even in such difficult times.\" South Wales Police chief constable Peter Vaughan said the decision \"recognises the significant challenges facing South Wales Police, and the investment required to maintain and enhance the policing of our communities\".

The board raised the issue in its annual report and said it planned to escalate its concerns. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said it had been excluded because \"commercially sensitive\" matters were discussed. In its report, the IMB said the decision to ban it from the quarterly meetings followed a change in healthcare provider at the 1,000-capacity men\u2019s prison, near Thetford. The report said: \"It is to be regretted that since the change of healthcare provider, the IMB has been excluded from attending healthcare meetings, in contravention of our right to attend any meetings. \"Consequently, it has been difficult to monitor healthcare as closely as we should like and to get accurate healthcare statistics.\" 'Official Secrets Act' IMBs comprise independent, unpaid volunteers who monitor day-to-day life at prisons to ensure proper standards of care and decency are maintained. Wayland IMB chairman Mike Gander told the BBC: \"We are very concerned at our exclusion and we are thinking of taking this to a high level within Her Majesty\u2019s Prison and Probation Service.\" He said the IMB only wanted to attend the meetings as observers. He questioned the cited concerns over \"commercial sensitivity\", claiming a number of providers were present at the meetings - which cover health provision at three Norfolk prisons - meaning they were unlikely to disclose sensitive information in front of other companies. In addition, he said, IMB members were required to sign the Official Secrets Act, meaning they would not share such information, even if it was raised. The BBC asked the MoJ whether the IMB had a right to attend, and whether it accepted monitoring healthcare and having accurate healthcare statistics was an important part of the IMB\u2019s role. The MoJ has yet to respond in detail, but did say the IMB should have access to minutes of healthcare meetings and relevant healthcare data.

The animals were released in areas that had no squirrels, including Shieldaig. Tree for Life said many of the squirrels were not only breeding but also spreading to other new areas. Becky Priestley, the charity's wildlife officer, said: \"Early indications are that this could be a real wildlife success story. \"The new squirrel populations are not only flourishing and breeding in their new homes, they are also starting to spread out into new areas - with squirrels being sighted as far as 15km away.\" The project's initial relocations took place between the springs of 2016 and 2017, with the first 33 squirrels from near Inverness and also in Moray released at Shieldaig in Wester Ross. This was followed by 22 more released at the Coulin Estate next to Beinn Eighe National Nature Reserve near Kinlochewe. Thirty squirrels were also released at Plockton, in Lochalsh, where the landowners include The National Trust for Scotland. Furry flit: How do you get a squirrel to move house? The squirrels were transported in nest boxes lined with hay and with food and water available. Small numbers of the animals were moved from where they are trapped so as to avoid harming the survival of \"donor populations\". The captured squirrels were also checked for diseases before being transported. At the new sites, the nest boxes were fitted to trees and the exit holes were opened and filled with grass, which the squirrels could push their way through to get outside.

But some in the sector said it could be a chance to attract new visitors and improve sustainability. The Welsh Government said a \u00a31.7bn support package had helped and it was committed to delivering sustainability. \"If things pick up and businesses do make it through, then I think we're very well-placed to pick up customers that would normally have gone overseas,\" said Adrian Greason-Walker of the WTA, which represents thousands of firms. \"However, we've probably had five weeks of trade this year instead of what would normally be 20 solid weeks over the summer. \"At the moment things are dark.\" It comes after the Welsh Government announced a ban on visitors travelling from coronavirus hotspots elsewhere in the UK, which came into effect on Friday. That followed mounting tension over fears from some residents around an \"influx\" of tourists to areas not currently subject to lockdown restrictions in Wales, such as Ceredigion, most of Carmarthenshire, Powys, Pembrokeshire and Gwynedd. A two-week \"fire break\" - a period with tighter restrictions to help break the trajectory of coronavirus cases rising in Wales - is also expected within days. Mr Greason-Walker said about half of tourism businesses surveyed by the WTA feared they might not survive the next six months, with some facing the \"worst possible scenario\". \"If we can pick up any silver lining from this awful situation then it's that we can still offer people some respite from it all. \"I think we've seen a return to family holidays to Wales, whereas before they might have caught a flight to Spain and spent a week on a beach over there. \"We've got a fantastic landscape and environment here. We're going to have to come out of this crisis at some point.\" One area significantly bucking the trend for reduced footfall was Snowdonia, with figures from Visit Wales suggesting more people intended to visit the national park than anywhere else in Wales over the next few months. \"I would say it's been the busiest summer that we have ever seen,\" said Helen Pye, the park's engagement officer. \"August was incredibly busy - and September the figures were up by about 40 to 50% compared to a normal year.\" However, having large numbers of visitors concentrated in certain areas has heightened fears about over-tourism. \"The tourism industry is incredibly important to us, but we've been seeing a huge increase in the challenges we already had,\" said Ms Pye. \"There's been an increase in traffic, pollution and noise in the national park. We've also seen huge amounts of litter in the area and anti-social behaviour and fly camping.\" However, she and others in the industry hope Wales can follow the lead of countries such as New Zealand and Iceland in introducing a sustainable tourism model - which would aim to spread visitors more evenly by promoting less well-known places. \"Sustainable tourism is about reducing the negative impacts of tourism and maximising the benefits,\" explained Louise Dixey, from Cardiff Metropolitan University's Next Tourism Generation project. \"It's not about the number of visitors, but it's about how much they spend and whether their visit can benefit local communities. \"There needs to be an emphasis on almost de-marketing some of these hotspots like Snowdonia and marketing unheard of places in Wales to try and spread the visitor load and make it more manageable.\" A winter break centred around long walks and dining out can be seen as bringing in far more benefit for less impact than a daytrip to the beach in the height of summer, for example, where the only expenses may be car parking and an ice cream. However, for some, the strategy still would not go far enough. Howard Huws, from Welsh language group, Cylch yr Iaith, said some Welsh-speaking communities had been feeling \"overwhelmed\" by the tourist trade for decades. \"We're constantly being told that the only way to deal with tourism is to bolster it further - but we are in a situation where it's already wreaking damage,\" said Mr Huws. \"People find themselves with few job opportunities - and any opportunities in tourism are seasonal and low paid. \"The cost of having those jobs is people then find themselves priced out of the housing market. We find ourselves unable to access the sites within our own landscape where tourism has taken control. \"They are talking about diversifying it and spreading it - but not about controlling it. Without controlling it - nothing is sustainable.\" Across the industry there is an acknowledgement coronavirus may have created a strange paradox, simultaneously crippling businesses while potentially increasing their future demand - as people switch from foreign holidays to staycations. \"There is a slight concern given the current situation that many tourism and hospitality businesses might not survive until spring 2021,\" said Ms Dixey. \"But there has been a surge in domestic demand. So we might actually be in a situation next year where market demand exceeds supply, particularly in relation to accommodation, which would limit the number of visitors.\" The Welsh Government said its \u00a31.7bn support package was the \"most generous\" in the UK and included a \u00a3500m economic resilience fund which had \"helped protect the livelihoods of more than 100,000 people\". A spokesman added: \"Over the course of the pandemic and in the coming years we will continue to listen closely to the people of Wales, the industry and visitors to ensure what we're delivering is sustainable and provides prosperity for everyone.\"", "output": "Covid: 'Dark days' for tourism in Wales, but some 'silver lining'", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

An average patient in Wales faces over \u00a31,500 in extra costs, including travel to hospital, on top of loss in income. The Welsh government said it was working to ease the financial burden. Research published by Macmillan suggested some 95% of patients face an increase in travel costs as they travel back and forth to hospital for treatment and follow-up appointments. On average, this amounts to an estimated \u00a3275 per patient in the first year, rising to \u00a3400 over five years. It found that an average \u00a3400 is spent on new clothes over five years as patients often lose or gain weight while undergoing treatment such chemotherapy, while wigs may also be needed. Energy bills also rise as a patient is often home more and other costs can include childcare and household modifications. It comes at a time when sufferers may also face a reduced income if they are unable to work, the charity said in its report, Counting the Cost of Cancer . It added that some cancer sufferers may also lose money due to UK government changes to the welfare system. The charity said it wanted every person affected by cancer in Wales to be made aware of their financial rights and entitlements from the point of diagnosis. It is urging the Welsh government to ensure that health professionals offer the information and advice as soon as possible. Susan Morris, general manager for Macmillan Cancer Support in Wales, said the financial impact of cancer was a growing problem in Wales. \"When people think of cancer they don't usually think of money,\" she said. 'Alleviate anxiety' \"But the sad fact is that for many people who get cancer, money is one of their biggest worries.\" She added: \"Access to timely and appropriate benefits advice can significantly reduce financial hardship, alleviate anxiety and stress, improve quality of life and help people make informed choices throughout their cancer journey.\" At the moment, patients and their families are not routinely offered financial advice and support when they receive a diagnosis. Fewer than half of people with a cancer diagnosis in Wales say they receive financial advice or support from any source, said the charity, which has its own welfare benefits advisers. This figure falls even further among the over-65s, where fewer than one in three receive support, the research found. The Welsh government said its Cancer Delivery Plan says that more care and treatment should be provided at local hospitals, reducing the need for patients to travel. \"But for rarer cancers, patients may still need to travel to specialist cancer centres to ensure the best outcome,\" a spokesman said. \"It also makes clear that following diagnosis, a patient's needs are assessed and information is provided on access to financial help and support. \"In addition, patients on certain benefits are entitled to reclaim some or all of their travel costs or those with a clinical need can arrange transport through the Patient Care Services.\" He added that cancer patients also benefit from free prescriptions and free hospital car parking in Wales.", "output": "Macmillan urges financial advice to cancer sufferers", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Huge and expensive state-of-the-art stadiums are a bad idea? Apparently not. 'Ridiculous' Tokyo's 2020 Olympic stadium will be bigger and more expensive than any of its recent predecessors. Renowned British architect Zaha Hadid has designed it. Some have likened it to a spaceship, others to a giant bicycle helmet. The initial budget was $3bn (\u00a31.8bn). That has since been scaled back to \"just\" $1.7bn. The arching roof will rise 70m (230ft) into the air. The original design would have been three times bigger than London's Olympic stadium. The revised design is now only twice as big. This has got some of Tokyo's more illustrious denizens up in arms. Primary among them is Fumihiko Maki, one of Japan's best-known architects who also designed the Tokyo gymnasium for the 1964 Olympics. \"I'm saying it's just ridiculous,\" he said. \"We are raising our voices, but they don't listen.\" It is hard to imagine this gentle, softly spoken 86-year-old getting angry, but it appears he has. Professor Maki's main issue with the stadium is its huge retractable roof. \"My biggest objection is to cover the stadium,\" he said. \"Technically it's more difficult and costly. This kind of system is not ideal for sports. All sports people would be against having a covered field. \"If you make an open stadium then later you could reduce the size to 60,000 as you have done in London. By building a covered stadium for 80,000 you can't change it.\" The reason Tokyo is building such a complex retractable roof is so the stadium can be used for concerts after the Olympics is over. Without a roof, the noise of rock and pop concerts would break Tokyo's tight noise restrictions, especially in the middle of a residential neighbourhood. That brings us to the second big problem: location. Green importance Tokyo, rightly, has a reputation for being a huge sprawling mess, with little in the way of town-planning or green spaces. The ones that it does have are therefore precious. The new stadium is being built smack in the middle of one of the greenest, most historic parts of the city - Meiji Jingu Gaien, whose name means \"The outer garden of the Meiji Shrine\". The Emperor Meiji is revered in Japan as the man who dragged the isolated backward country in the modern world. \"When the Emperor Meiji passed away in 1912, people from all over Japan donated money to buy this land,\" said Nobuko Shimizu, a member of a group called \"The Custodians of the National Stadium\" that has been campaigning to stop the old stadium from being demolished. \"The Emperor Meiji loved sports. So they built a gymnasium and a baseball field and an art gallery to celebrate his accomplishments.\" \"This place is a kind of oasis,\" she added, pointing to nearby Ginko trees. \"We can walk and chat and hold picnics here. If the new stadium is built, we would lose those parks and greens. It is not acceptable.\" The exasperation in her voice is clear. Hundreds of her group took to the streets to protest this summer, and more than 13,000 people signed a petition against the new stadium. But the Japanese Sports Council remains unmoved. \"I don't think there is a chance it will be changed,\" said Yoshitaka Takasaki of the Japan Sports Council. \"We have notified architects from around the world about the design competition. Forty-six designs were entered, and Zaha Hadid's design was selected. We followed a proper process. We have a responsibility to build a new stadium based on her design.\" 'Bureaucratic arrogance' Professor Maki remains unimpressed by such arguments. He has accused the sports council of bureaucratic arrogance and leading Tokyo down the same road that Beijing took in 2008. \"Somebody at the decision-making level wants to do it again, just like in the case of China,\" he said. \"They want to show off shining technology so that people will marvel at it. It is exactly the same mentality in our government.\" \"We have a very modernised country but we still have a bureaucracy that governs everything,\" the designer of the 1964 gymnasium added. \"We are not a civil society where citizen voices can be critical.\"", "output": "Tokyo Olympic stadium: Sports cathedral or white elephant?", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

What's the problem with plastic straws? Most straws are made from plastics such as polypropylene and polystyrene, which unless recycled take hundreds of years to decompose. It means small plastic items like straws, coffee cup lids and plastic bottle tops are strewn in the ocean and on landfill sites - even though they may only have been used for the time it takes to finish a drink. Ms Westwood's Facebook post, which warned that \"the straw in your cocktail or coffee will be on this planet forever\", has been shared nearly 300,000 times. \"Very little is recycled, and much ends up on the ocean,\" it read. Wetherspoon, which hands out 70 million straws a year, says bar staff had complained about chucking vast quantities of used straws away during their shifts. \"This subject was coming up more and more often,\" says Ms Cacioppo. Kate Dell, All Bar One's assistant marketing manager, a chain which gets through 4.7 million straws a year but has vowed to reduce its straw usage by one-third, says she is confident customers would be \"happy to enjoy their drinks straw-free\". What should we be doing? Simon Ellin, chief executive of the UK Recycling Association, says \"nobody would be bothered\" if bartenders stopped automatically putting straws in drinks and it is free for companies to implement. \"I had a pint of soda water the other day and not only did they put two straws in it but a stirrer, and I asked why they had done that - I'd imagine most people wouldn't query it,\" he says. Paper straws are another alternative to cut waste - although Wetherspoon's Ms Cacioppo says the business will face \"extra costs\" for introducing them and admits they \"feel a tiny bit different - but I don't think it's a big deal\". But Mark Hall, commercial director at BusinessWaste.co.uk, says it is not enough for pubs to simply phase out straws - saying people should be expected to pay tax for their straws, similar to the 5p carrier bag charge. \"Why on earth do you need a straw in your gin and tonic anyway?\" he says. \"The industry can do something about it, but so can we as consumers - it's easy to say 'no straw please'.\" Why are plastic straws so popular? From adding a flourish to a cocktail to apparently making a drink taste better, straws have been commonplace in almost every restaurant and bar in the UK for decades. Rye grass straws were used for hundreds of years before the first old-style paper straw was patented in the US in 1888 by inventor Marvin Stone - which since the 1970s has gradually been replaced by plastic alternatives. McDonald's has even claimed its Coca-Cola tastes better when drunk through one of its straws - which are slightly wider than in other fast food chains. The chain, which hands out free straws with its drinks, and serves 3.5 million people in the UK every day, says it has invested in recycling units in its restaurants to cut waste. \"This includes our straws, which are made from recyclable plastic,\" a spokesman said. Does using a straw protect my teeth? But what about the damage to your teeth? Dentists say sipping through a straw can reduce the amount of liquid with which your teeth come in contact - potentially preventing tea and coffee stains, as well as erosion from fizzy drinks. Experts have even advised Prosecco-lovers to drink the wine through a straw to protect their teeth from the high acid and sugar content. But Dr Nigel Carter, chief executive of the Oral Health Foundation, says people can protect their teeth by having a drink during mealtimes rather than on its own. \"However, if we are to consume them outside of these times, using a straw really can help to reduce some of the damage,\" he says.", "output": "Why plastic straws could disappear from a pub near you", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Morrison then successfully appealed to the Inner House of the Court of Session, relying on section 11(3) of the Act. This postpones the claim date where the \"the creditor was not aware, and could not with reasonable diligence have been aware, that loss, injury or damage caused as aforesaid had occurred\" until a later date.

BBC News is the first to be allowed to see inside the LHC - on the French-Swiss border - to watch the work being carried out. Scientists believe the upgrade will enable them to discover new particles which will lead to a more complete theory of how the Universe works. A project leader with the LHC's Atlas experiment, Dr Pippa Wells, told BBC News that there was much more to come from the LHC. \"The past two years have been the most exciting in my time as a particle physicist. People are absolutely fired up. They've made one new discovery (the Higgs) and they want to make more discoveries with the new high energies that the upgrade will give us. We could find a new realm of particle physics.\" I was taken by the technical coordinator for the upgrade project, Katy Foraz, and Cern's UK communications manager Stephanie Hills, to one of the many access points to the LHC's underground tunnels. We entered a lift shaft with two buttons marked zero and minus 1. Katy hit minus 1 and we made our way 100m below the surface. As we exited the lift, we walked to a large heavy green door that we strained to open. As we went through, it was like entering Aladdin's cave. No jewels or gold - but one of the largest and most complex machines ever built. A bright blue superconducting beamline stretches into the distance - around it are gleaming precision instruments to make the line one of the coldest places in the Universe. In front of me, engineers were replacing some of the first connectors. In all, 10,000 will need to be changed. Eight hundred people are involved in this project, which will cost \u00a370m. The tasks also include testing and replacing some of the LHC's main dipole and quadrupole magnets, which are used to bend the paths of the particles and keep them tightly bunched; conducting tests to detect any irregularities in the magnets or imperfections in the electrical insulation; and a range of other work to improve the machine. The LHC is known for its cutting-edge science. But as we walked to this scientific wonderland, Katy told me that people often forget that the particle accelerator is also on the cutting edge of engineering. After all, creating the conditions of the beginning of the Universe is no easy feat. \"We are always at the limit of what we know in terms of the technology. It is very exciting: as the coordinator. I have access to all the technologies and they really are at their limit in terms of superconductivity cryogenics. It is very exciting for an engineer to be close to all these new technologies,\" she said. Katy and her team of engineers are calling the work an \"upgrade\". But critics say it's a \"repair\". As we walked passed a team replacing a damaged connector, Cern's Stephanie Hills was quick to respond to the charge that this expensive refit is putting right a mistake that should not have been made in the first place. \"Nobody has ever done this kind of technology before. Everything from the most basic welding to the most complicated beam diagnostics is pushing the boundaries of technology, and sometimes these things just don't go right simply because we don't know how it's going to work,\" she told me. \"You can see in front of us the way that we're managing the upgrade is meticulous. There is lots and lots of quality control, making sure that everything's absolutely spot-on so that when we turn the machine back on we are absolutely ready for some more fantastic scientific discoveries.\" The damage was done shortly after the switch on of the Large Hadron Collider in September 2008. Nine days later, it broke down because the connections between the superconducting magnets simply could not take the current running through them. It took a year and \u00a324m pounds of taxpayer's money to repair the damage. Even then it could only operate on half power. That was enough to discover the much sought-after Higgs Boson. Those in charge made a pragmatic decision. They decided to press ahead, and to keep their funders happy. To their joy and relief, scientists found their prize last summer. And so at the beginning of this year it was politically possible for Cern to begin the long shut down to fix faulty connections. Back above ground, students from around the world are shown the Atlas control room, one of the places where data from the LHC will be gathered when it is switched back on. That is something for the students to look forward to - because after the upgrade, the beams will be crashing into each other at twice the energy. This will enable researchers here to move on to their ultimate goal: to find evidence of \"new physics\", which they believe will lead to a new, more compete theory of sub-atomic physics. The discovery of the Higgs last year was the end of a successful chapter of late 20th Century physics. This was the development of the current theory in the 1960s and 70s called the \"Standard Model\". This theory says that most of the forces of nature, the objects around us and our own existence, are all down to the interaction of the Higgs with 16 other particles. It successfully explains how electricity, magnetism and light operate. Since then, all the particles predicted by the Standard Model have been discovered - including most recently the Higgs. The problem though is scientists known this theory is limited. It explains extremely well the world around us, but it cannot explain the way most of the Universe behaves. Physicists hope that by operating at full power, the LHC will be able to find evidence of so-called supersymmetric particles. These are like the particles in the Standard Model - but more massive. One form of supersymmetry predicts that there should be five Higgs bosons, which are each slightly different. The first order of business for LHC scientists when the collisions resume in 2015 will be to test the Higgs that's been discovered, to see if it shows any of the properties predicted by supersymmetry, according to Dr Wells. \"The LHC is more than just a one trick pony,\" said Dr Wells. \"It wasn't designed to find just the Higgs. We hope to find something completely new that will change our understanding of the Universe. We are on the threshold of finding many more new particles.\" Follow Pallab on Twitter @bbcpallab", "output": "LHC upgrade to open up 'new realm of particle physics'", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

The tripcock automatically prevents trains passing red signals. London Underground (LU) said it was considering what the right level of maintenance was for the new fleet of trains which have inbuilt technology to warn of problems with the tripcock. A full fleet of new trains will be in operation on the District, Circle, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines by 2016. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) claims the checks will be reduced to the equivalent of an average running period of 60 days. 'Cuts-lead move' Currently, depending on the fleet, checks are carried out from every two days upwards. RMT General Secretary Bob Crow said: \"This is a cuts-led move that follows hacking back of safety inspections on escalators and out on the tracks and comes at a time when maintenance cuts are already causing havoc on a daily basis with signal failures and breakdowns commonplace. \"This move on the tripcocks inspections ratchets up the safety concerns of RMT and is literally dicing with death.\" But LU's Phil Hufton said no decision had been made on changes to the frequency of tripcock maintenance on Underground trains. He said: \"It is absolutely correct that we are working with Bombardier to look at what the right level of maintenance is for the brand new, state-of-the-art trains that are being introduced. \"The technology on board these new trains allows us to download information that will tell us well in advance if any part of the train needs attention.\" He said this reduces the need to carry out \"time-consuming and outdated maintenance activities which are no longer the industry norm\".

It is early August and Historic Scotland is hosting one of its biggest weekends of the year, Celebration of the Centuries. Thousands of people arrive to see re-enactors and living history groups portray life from the time of the Iron Age through to World War II. Children get their faces painted by Pictish women while people queuing at an ice cream van watch soldiers of the Napoleonic Wars drill in the fort's parade ground. A Roman legionnaire, on a break from his duties with The Antonine Guard re-enactment society, takes to an outdoor dance floor with his wife while a 1940s dance band plays the soundtrack to the war-time years. Meanwhile, in the event's main arena, a group dressed as World War I soldiers open canisters of coloured smoke to help them explain the horrors of a poisonous gas attack. Other re-enactors include John Lyons, of The Historic Saltire Society and who is portraying King Robert the Bruce. There are also ladies dressed as elegant 16th Century aristocrats and even pirates. Later, tourists and re-enactors stand shoulder to shoulder at the fort's battlements to watch an aerial display by a Spitfire, the poster plane of World War II's Battle of Britain. \"I think that in today's age, groups like ourselves play a huge part in widening understanding of Scotland's varied and diverse history,\" says Kevin Grant, of The Antonine Guard. \"The internet has made information readily available at the click of a mouse, however, groups like ours and those of the differing time periods bring an immediate strong visual presentation and a lasting one. \"We feel we play a strong part in making history accessible and fun.\" He adds: \"On a personal level it also allows us to actually feel in a small way what it would have been like, in terms of wearing and drilling in the armour and just how strong and physically fit these men were. \"At some point in their life who doesn't want to be a Roman, or a Viking, or a knight?\" Kevin finds that, in general, people are surprised by how much the Romans and their empire are wrapped up in Scotland's past. The Romans posted auxiliary soldiers from France, Belgium, Spain and Germany on the Antonine Wall, which runs from Old Kilpatrick on the north side of the River Clyde to Bo'ness on the Firth of Forth. A unit of Syrian archers was based near Croy in North Lanarkshire. \"Some of the best military remains for camps and fortification are in Scotland and many important archaeological finds have been discovered here,\" says Kevin. 'Risk assessment' Husband and wife team Alan and Maureen Neilson got involved in living history 18 years ago. They are interested in 13th and 14th centuries, but also later periods such as the 18th Century. At Fort George, Maureen is made up to look like a medieval plague victim while Alan dons the sinister, bird-like mask of a plague doctor. Alan says living history and re-enactment has evolved over the years. \"The early days we indeed had good fun but basically all the groups were much the same, a bunch of blokes out for a bit of a sword fight, a good old drink and all the better if you could find an employer who would pay,\" he says. Today, groups such as The Historic Saltire Society, which the Neilsons with others helped to set up, write detailed business plans, bid for Lottery grants and have to have official paperwork that allows them to attend events such as Celebration of the Centuries. \"All the groups now are covered with insurances, have Disclosure Scotland certificates and have to produce a risk assessment sheet before the event,\" says Alan. \"Whoever the employer - Historic Scotland, National Trust, clan gatherings, private companies, charities, schools or museums - all insist on this type of professionalism.\" Fort George is not the only place to find a gathering of re-enactors. They pop up regularly at places such as Urquhart Castle on the shores of Loch Ness and Culloden Battlefield. 'Adrenaline sports' Inverness-based Ian Deveney, meanwhile, is among history buffs to have turned his interest into an almost full-time job. With his business, Battlescar, he tours Scotland re-enacting various periods such the Vikings, the Scottish Wars of Independence and Jacobites. \"I've been doing re-enactments for 23 years,\" says Ian. \"I was into adrenaline sports like white-water rafting and kayaking and then myself and one of my mates were asked if we would like to do some re-enacting. We dressed as Jacobites, got this great buzz from doing the re-enacting and the rest is history as they say.\" Ian has also sought to better understand past times by re-enacting events while wearing authentic period clothing right down to the footwear, while carrying replica weapons and eating the foods that were available in those times. \"You grow up with these ideas of what happened in the past,\" he says. \"Being part of re-enactments has changed how I used to view history.\" In 2009, Ian and a group of friends retraced the retreat of Bonnie Prince Charlie's army from their defeat at Culloden, near Inverness, to Ruthven Barracks, south of Aviemore. Then, only a few days later, he joined archaeologist Dr Tony Pollard for a re-enactment of the Jacobites' Night March of 15 April 1746. Dr Pollard, of the University of Glasgow, says: \"Re-enactors are a strange breed, pretty eccentric but all with a passion for history, which I guess makes them my kind of people.\" \"They do everything, from recreating medieval rope to fighting huge battles. \"I saw my first re-enactment when I was about nine years old. Had to walk miles to see the Sealed Knot doing their stuff, loved it so much I went back for a second day.\" A member of Diehards, a group specialising in the Zulu War of 1879, helped Tony to explain the use of large and small buttons on the tunics of British soldiers at the battle of Isandlwana. In September this year, Tony sought the help of 20 re-enactors to help explain events of 1513's Battle of Flodden. Elements of the clash between armies of Scots and English was recreated close to the battlefield, but not on it. \"I'm not keen on re-enactments taking place on actual battlefields,\" says the archaeologist. \"Battlefields are hallowed ground where people fought and died. We should not be 'playing' at war on this hallowed ground.'' If given the opportunity, would re-enactors travel back in time to experience the periods they dedicate so much of their time and energy to portraying? Alan Neilson does not think so. \"Would I like to live in the past, not on your life,\" he says. \"We are far too soft, our bodies would not be able to cope with the cold winters, no central heating, the growing of food, health and the lack of hygiene, the feudal system - you and I would be near the bottom - wars, crime and on and on. \"Perhaps I would like to drop in on certain events or times but for a short period only, the crowning of Robert the Bruce for example. \"But personally I would not be interested in watching some of the great battles of the past, I think the reality of medieval warfare would be unpalatable.\"", "output": "Living history: People re-creating Scotland's past", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

The source added the Queen decided to let it be known she had the vaccination to prevent further speculation. The Queen, 94, and Prince Philip, 99, are among around 1.5 million people in the UK to have had at least one dose of a Covid vaccine so far. People aged over 80 in the UK are among the high-priority groups who are being given the vaccine first. The couple have been spending the lockdown in England at their Windsor Castle home after deciding to have a quiet Christmas at their Berkshire residence, instead of the traditional royal family gathering at Sandringham. Last month, the Queen appeared alongside several other senior members of the royal family for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic began. In 2020 she went seven months - between March and October - without carrying out public engagements outside of a royal residence. During that time, her eldest child, Prince Charles, 72, contracted coronavirus and displayed mild symptoms. Palace sources also told the BBC that her grandson Prince William tested positive in April - although Kensington Palace refused to comment officially. The Queen used her Christmas Day message to reassure anyone struggling without friends and family this year that they \"are not alone\". She said the pandemic had \"brought us closer\" despite causing hardship, adding that the Royal Family has been \"inspired\" by people volunteering in their communities. On Friday a third coronavirus vaccine - made by US company Moderna - was approved for use in the UK, joining the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines already approved by UK regulators. It is not known which vaccine the Queen and Prince Philip have received. All the approved vaccines require two doses to provide the best possible protection, with the second dose being given up to 12 weeks after the first.

The molluscs form large colonies on hard surfaces and can block pipes and cause flooding, the trust said. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it would take action to tackle the threat. Some scientists say the mussel poses the maximum risk to the UK environment of any non-native species. The 4cm (1.5in) bivalves originated in Ukraine and spread across Europe as new canals opened, a WWT spokesman said. They were introduced to the US by ships discharging their ballast in the Great Lakes. Quagga mussels Sources: Environment Agency and the National Wildlife Federation The species is flourishing in Lake Mead, formed by the Hoover dam, and engineers are working to stop them colonising the dam's turbines and blocking the pipes which supply water to Las Vegas, the spokesman said. Earlier this year a group of scientists at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) identified the quagga mussel as the single greatest threat to the UK's wildlife of any alien species. Dr Helen Roy, one of the scientists involved in the research, said that, after looking at hundreds of species from all over the world, the quagga mussel was the most likely to arrive and establish itself in the UK and pose a danger to biodversity there. Sarah Chare, from the Environment Agency, said the quagga mussel affected water quality as well as clogging up pipes. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said it would be working to reduce the risks of the quagga mussels spreading any further.

Hundreds of people were injured, many of them on roads as they tried to flee tornadoes. Heavy rain has also left many areas flooded. Two weeks ago a massive tornado struck the Oklahoma City suburb of Moore, killing 24 people. The National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Centre warned that the severe weather was moving east on Sunday, threatening an area from Virginia to Maine with damaging winds and heavy downpours. 'Lifted off the road' The Oklahoma Corporation Commission said more than 91,000 homes and businesses were still without power on Saturday. Workers are trying to clear downed lines. Some 8in (20cm) of rain fell on the Oklahoma City area, causing flash flooding. A trailer park in Oklahoma City was among the areas evacuated. Governor Mary Fallin insisted: \"We're going to get through this.\" The storm struck in the rush hour on Friday night, with many people taking to the roads to try to get to safer areas. Terri Black, a teacher's assistant in Moore, told Associated Press she had tried to outrun a predicted tornado: \"It was chaos. People were going southbound in the northbound lanes. Everybody was running for their lives. \"My car was actually lifted off the road and then set back down.\" Two of those who died, a mother and her baby, were sucked out of their car when the largest tornado of the storm struck near the Oklahoma town of El Reno. The tornado ripped down the highway, overturning cars and lorries. Amy Elliott, a spokeswoman for the Oklahoma medical examiner's office, confirmed two children and seven adults had died in the state. Scott Holste, a spokesman for Missouri Governor Jay Nixon, said three people had died in flooding in that state. Violent winds overturned vehicles on Interstate 70 between St Louis and St Charles County. Mr Nixon toured affected areas and urged residents to avoid flooded regions. \"Missouri has been hit by several rounds of severe storms in the past few weeks,\" he said. \"Because many streams and rivers are overflowing their banks, we will need to stay vigilant in both monitoring and responding to flooding across the state as well. This remains a dangerous situation.\" In Iowa, Governor Terry Branstad issued a disaster proclamation for several flooded counties. A school in Gillespie, Illinois, had its roof torn off by a tornado packing 115mph (185km/h) winds. Meteorologists said the tornadoes were less severe than the one that struck Moore two weeks ago.

But health ministers moved amendments to the Health and Social Care Bill, promising \"checks and balances\". The bill has had a difficult passage through Parliament. Several Liberal Democrats have raised concerns, prompting a \"pause\" last year. The government has also faced problems getting the legislation - which has already been passed by the House of Commons - through the House of Lords. Under the bill, NHS foundation trusts would have to ensure the majority of their income came from NHS treatments, effectively allowing them to raise 49% from private work. 'Alarmist' But opponents argue this is too limited a barrier against privatisation. So the government has tabled an amendment stating that any increase of 5% or more in private income would have to be approved by a foundation trust's council of governors. The governors would also have to be satisfied that increasing private income would not interfere with the primary duty of providing NHS care. Most trusts are currently limited to private work amounting to about 2% of their income. In the Lords, Health Minister Earl Howe acknowledged fears that removing the cap could see trusts \"increasing private income at the expense of NHS patients\", creating a \"two-tier\" health service \"with those who can afford to pay going to the front of the queue\". 'Magic' But he insisted: \"That is wrong and, I believe, alarmist. There are robust safeguards in place to prevent that kind of outcome. \"Allowing a foundation trust to generate more private income does not release it from its prime duty to its NHS patients.\" For Labour, Baroness Thornton welcomed the change as a move in the right direction, but urged ministers to ensure there was no possibility of \"cross-subsidy\" from the NHS to the private sector either directly or through some \"accountancy magic\". Labour tabled its own amendment, aimed at deleting the clause of the bill which calls for the ending of the cap on private income for the NHS. But this was defeated by 58 votes after Lord Howe warned it would effectively end the duty on trusts to remain \"predominantly\" NHS providers. The government's concession comes ahead of a potential revolt over the health reforms for England at this weekend's Liberal Democrat spring conference.

The concepts have rather impenetrable names right now - Loft, STE-Quest, MarcoPolo-R, and Echo - but that will change for the one eventually selected. \"Originally we had 47 proposals,\" said Fabio Favata, head of Esa's Science Planning and Community Coordination Office. \"Our working groups and the Space Science Advisory Committee did a great job in trimming the list when they had quite a number of missions that could all potentially make good candidates,\" he told BBC News. The mission concepts are put together by research teams whose members drawn from across Europe: Large Observatory For X-ray Timing (Loft): The mission would go after the fast-moving, high-energy environments that surround black holes, neutron stars and pulsars - objects that can produce sudden and very rapid bursts of X-rays. By observing this emission, scientists would hope to address questions related to fundamental physics: they could probe the effects of matter entering ultra-strong gravitational fields and ultra-dense states. They could also measure more accurately the mass and spin of black holes; and in the case of the biggest such objects in the Universe, this has something interesting to say about how they, and the galaxies that host them, formed. Space-Time Explorer and Quantum Equivalence Principle Space Test (STE-Quest): Again, this mission would address some big physics topics. One objective would be to test \"the equivalence principle\", which underpins several fundamental assumptions including the idea that gravity will accelerate all objects in a vacuum equally regardless of their masses or the materials from which they are made. The Apollo 15 astronaut Dave Scott famously demonstrated this principle when he dropped a hammer and feather on the Moon in 1971 and both hit the surface at the same time. STE-Quest would put very sensitive instrumentation on an orbiting satellite to do a far more precise test of whether gravity really is so blind or perhaps varies on some scales. MarcoPolo-R: This is an idea that has been around for a while. The mission would attempt to return a sample of material from an asteroid for detailed analysis in Earth laboratories. The most primitive asteroids contain geochemistry not observable in Earth rocks because they are constantly recycled. As such, asteroids can tell scientists a lot about conditions in the early Solar System, and about the original \"stuff\" that went into making the planets billions of years ago. One potential target is actually two asteroids in close proximity - a binary known as (175706) 1996FG3. The larger rock is about 1.5km across; its companion is less than half a km in diameter. Exoplanet Characterisation Observatory (Echo): This is a 1.2m telescope that would study planets circling far-away stars. In recent years, hundreds of these so-called exoplanets have been detected, but we know precious little about them yet. Echo would observe the planets as they moved in front of their stars. From the way the light is attenuated, the telescope's detectors would be able to probe the atmospheres of these worlds. Echo would look for the presence of molecules such as ozone and carbon dioxide in the atmospheres. These and other markers might tell us something about whether any of the exoplanets have conditions capable of supporting life. It takes a long time to plan and then implement a mission. The science has to be compelling and the engineering requirements must be realistic. The feasibility of implementing this quartet will now be thoroughly investigated before a \"winner\" is chosen. It could take up to four years for a final decision to be made. Esa is running the competition under its Cosmic Vision programme, and has about 470 million euros (at 2010 prices) to spend on what it terms a Medium Class science mission. The member states would individually cover the cost of building any instruments that go on the spacecraft. This new opportunity is known as M3; the reason being that there is already a competition in play for an M1 and an M2 spacecraft, with the first of these likely to launch in 2017. Esa has a Large Class of much more expensive ventures, as well. This competition is in the final stages of selection with a launch opportunity proposed for 2020. If the winner of this competition is delayed for any reason and cannot make the 2020 slot, Esa would like the M3 proposal to be ready to take its place on the launch pad.

Or almost everything - since 1931, this all-Aussie brand has in fact been owned by the American giant General Motors. It is Holden's position in the global market that is key to understanding the rise and fall of car manufacturing in Australia. Holden started off as an Adelaide saddle-maker before adapting to the arrival of motorbikes and cars by supplying upholstery and vehicle bodies. Following World War Two, it got the backing of the Australian government, which wanted to kickstart domestic car manufacturing and give the nation some global status. The birth of the first Holden 48-215 in 1948 began the public's love affair with \"Australia's own car\", which would blossom over the decades. \"It's what we grew up with, it's just what we know,\" explains Jason Fischer from Gosford Classic Car Museum, as he shows me their collection of vintage Holdens, from one of the first 48-215s to a classic Aussie ute. \"I came home from hospital in a Holden car, my dad had one, my grandfather had one and so on, so you know - it's just a natural progression.\" While there were other cars on the market, Holden could lay claim to producing the first vehicle made by Australians, for Australians. \"They were rugged, they could deal with our temperatures,\" Mr Fischer says. \"Outback Australia is a pretty harsh place and these things were made tough.\" Tribal loyalty Through the 1960s and '70s, Holden was king of the road in Australia, with the only serious competition coming from Ford, who launched their own Australian-made family car, the Falcon. Toyota also started production in Australia in 1963, but it was Holden and Ford who built almost tribal loyalty among their customers, which culminated each year in the companies going head-to-head in the Bathurst 1000 motor race. These were the sunshine years - the time of that technicolor TV advert for meat pies and kangaroos that showed Holden cars being driven by happy, smiling, patriotic Australians. As more families could afford a car, Holden expanded and introduced its popular new model, the Commodore. Until the late 1980s, steep import tariffs kept Australian-made cars ahead of the pack, as foreign-built vehicles from the rest of the world remained largely unaffordable. But that same protectionist policy may have created complacency, according to Prof Roy Green, the dean of UTS Business School in Sydney. \"In a sense, the Australian local assembly industry was destined to fail because it was established originally behind very high tariff barriers,\" he argues. \"It couldn't become export competitive when the tariffs were reduced. This is when imports started to flood in and the local industry was very slow to adapt, very slow to take on new ideas and methods.\" As those tariffs started to fall, global competition increased - but Holden's decline wasn't instant. The company's Commodore model continued to figure prominently among Australia's best-selling cars well into the 21st Century. Holden was also an important exporter, shipping cars to the Middle East and Brazil, and contributing significantly to Australia's balance of trade. 'Loss for Australia' But by 2013, with decades of government subsidies drying up, the writing was on the wall and Holden announced it could no longer afford to manufacture cars in Australia. With Ford and Toyota already having ceased production in Australia, Holden said its vehicles would also be built abroad. The decision means the deep loyalty many customers have felt will be tested. At the Australian Car Sales garage in western Sydney, we found one worker with a Holden tattoo on his arm. But manager Shayne Hennessey is concerned about how people will respond. \"I think it's going to be a huge loss for Australia,\" he says. \"I don't think the public are going to take lightly to this, they might go to a different brand.\" At the moment around 70% of customers at his used car yard are looking for a Holden Commodore, and he anticipates there will at least be an initial spike in sales for the last Australian-made Holden cars. \"The only thing it's going to be now is a historic car,\" he says. \"[For] people who can afford to put it away in the garage, it might be worth a fair bit of money in years to come.\" With the rapid growth in electric vehicles threatening to disrupt the market, there is at least some hope Australia could one day produce its own cars again.

The American Cancer Society team said this was the first time reduced risk was specifically linked to walking. UK experts said it was more evidence that lifestyle influenced cancer risk. A recent poll for the charity Ramblers found a quarter of adults walk for no more than an hour a week - but being active is known to reduce the risk of a number of cancers. Recreational activity This study, published in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention followed 73,615 women out of 97,785 aged 50-74 who had been recruited by the American Cancer Society between 1992 and 1993 so it could monitor the incidence of cancer in the group. They were asked to complete questionnaires on their health and on how much time they were active and participating in activities such as walking, swimming and aerobics and how much time they spent sitting watching television or reading. They completed the same questionnaires at two-year intervals between 1997 and 2009. Of the women, 47% said walking was their only recreational activity. Those who walked for at least seven hours per week had a 14% lower risk of breast cancer compared to those who walked three or fewer hours per week. Dr Alpa Patel, a senior epidemiologist at the American Cancer Society in Atlanta Georgia, who led the study, said: \"Given that more than 60% of women report some daily walking, promoting walking as a healthy leisure-time activity could be an effective strategy for increasing physical activity amongst post-menopausal women. \"We were pleased to find that without any other recreational activity, just walking one hour a day was associated with a lower risk of breast cancer in these women. \"More strenuous and longer activities lowered the risk even more.\" Baroness Delyth Morgan, chief executive of Breast Cancer Campaign, said: \"This study adds further evidence that our lifestyle choices can play a part in influencing the risk of breast cancer and even small changes incorporated into our normal day-to-day activity can make a difference. She added: \"We know that the best weapon to overcoming breast cancer is the ability to stop it occurring in the first place. \"The challenge now is how we turn these findings into action and identify other sustainable lifestyle changes that will help us prevent breast cancer.\"", "output": "Walking 'cuts breast cancer risk'", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

One company, New Earth Solutions, stored \"excessive\" waste outside, where inspectors saw a number of flies. The company has not commented but the Environment Agency said breaches were not linked to the rise in flies. But residents living nearby said the problem was so bad \"they might as well live under mosquito nets\". BBC Inside Out West discovered the rule breaches over the 12 months from July 2018. Environment Agency (EA) inspectors found 5,000 bales of waste were being stored there at the end of June and told the firm it was \"considered to be storing waste in excess of the set limits\". They also said \"flies are noticeable outside of the processing halls, basking on the bales stored immediately outside the building and residual wastes spilt on the aprons, caused by vehicle movements\". The EA reports also said the management \"accepted [it] has exceeded the quantity that can be processed and removed without causing a build-up of onsite materials\". Despite inspectors noticing more flies at the plant, a statement from the EA insisted there was no link. \"Monitoring of fly numbers does not appear to show a link between reports of flies in Avonmouth and the increase in bales stored outside New Earth Solutions,\" a statement said. The organisation said New Earth Solutions was \"making progress in clearing the backlog\". Campaigner and resident Ian Robinson said he did not agree with that view and said the EA had \"fingers in their ears\" over the complaints. \"Of course it's contributing,\" he said. \"Seeing as those bales are getting ripped by seagulls, by rats, they're being damaged by being moved, they're falling over [and] they're not being stacked correctly.\" He has called on the Environment Agency to take enforcement action against the firm. The city council has previously said it took concerns \"seriously\" but had \"found no issues\". Local MP Darren Jones has written to the Environment Secretary to ask for more powers for the EA to deal with organisations that breach their environmental permits.

How does our approach need to change, if the National Health Service is to cope with future demand? Dr Michael Dixon: Do I need the Doctor? GP Dr Michael Dixon chairs the NHS Alliance, and advises the College of Medicine. \"Patients are the renewable energy resource of the health service. We've got to start seeing ourselves as the creators of health - individually and collectively - and not just passive recipients of whatever the professionals want to give us. \"We don't take health as seriously as disease. We focus too much on the operations on the hearts and limbs and eyes for diabetics many years down the road, or gastric banding for the overweight. We've got to start preventing those patients needing those interventions in the first place. \"I run what you might call a one-stop shop. So we've not only got conventional GP and community services, but also complementary services, a cafe, pharmacy and voluntary sector services. \"We concentrate on health in every sense, caring for patients when they need it, but enabling them to look after themselves and live better and happier lives whenever we can. I'd like to reinvent the GP practice as a club where - with minor or self-limiting illnesses - we help each other to help ourselves, rather than use professional resources unnecessarily. \"No one expects their next door neighbour to be looking after their cancer or heart disease, but if we continue to spend as much NHS money as we do at present on things which could have been prevented, or don't actually need high tech input, then we will make the health service bankrupt and we won't have one tomorrow.\" Dr Charles Alessi: The Patient in Charge GP Dr Charles Alessi is co-chairman of the National Association Of Primary Care, and a senior adviser to Public Health England. \"The current healthcare system is on the verge of a revolution that will make our current ways seem as quaint as the horse and cart. \"More and more patients are taking control of their health. Patients regularly come to my surgery with a sheaf of internet printouts revealing their diagnosis and their suggestions for treatment. \"We can utilise this willingness to create a better healthcare system for us all. \"Other forms of digital technology can also empower patients. For people who have a single long- term condition like diabetes, there are already smartphone apps which advise how to alter your insulin dosage, or even change your medication. \"In my vision, patients will carry their own medical records from practitioner to practitioner, demanding that care is carried out in convenient places such as pharmacies and supermarkets. Procedures like chemotherapy and dialysis will be delivered in the community or at home - not at a huge building we call a hospital. \"This may sound somewhat scary: next it'll be robots diagnosing and treating our illnesses. But the use of technology is to empower. It isn't to replace the doctor. It doesn't mean that face-to-face human interaction forged over the long-term is threatened. It is just different and more tailored to the individual. \"None of this will happen effortlessly. The change in the doctor - from the person in charge to an advocate and mentor through life-long illnesses - will not be easy. No doubt there will be resistance in places, and we will make some mistakes. \"But the days of the patient being subordinate to a great monolithic system are coming to an end.\" Dame Carol Black: Wellness at Work Dame Carol Black is a former president of the Royal College of Physicians, and led two independent reviews for government about health in the workplace. \"We often think of the workplace as just where we go to do our job. But the workplace is more than that. It has the potential to be a place where you can improve your health. It can be a place to promote health - both physical and mental - and a place where you can improve well-being. \"There are good business cases now showing that investing in the health and well-being of staff is really investing in productivity, investing in being more profitable; and we've got lots of cases where we can show that. The business case has been proven. \"Good management requires that you listen to people. Even if you are a small company, there are many little things that don't require lots of money. You can take advantage of free smoking cessation classes. You can introduce a lunchtime walking club. You might have a yoga session at the end of the day. \"Our NHS is so busy dealing with people who are ill that it is very difficult to spend a lot of time and energy on prevention. As we're living longer, we're expected to work longer, so all of these things are an additional pressure, and it's really important for the workplace to play its part. \"Then I believe we will access our health service less, we will be healthier, and we will be a saving and a gain to the NHS.\" Prof John Ashton: Healthier Homes Prof John Ashton is president of the Faculty of Public Health. \"I'm very interested in how we live as we get older. Health and housing are indivisible. They are also indivisible from living in a good, supportive neighbourhood. \"In 1948, when the health service was founded, the Department of Health was the Department of Health and Housing. \"How can we reconnect these two important areas to make it possible for people who are living longer to live a full life in the community? \"A new generation of better designed and more attractive homes for the elderly would provide a healthier living environment for many who currently live alone in homes that are too large and insufficiently adapted to their needs. \"A return to the 'almshouse' model would provide a supportive environment, free from the isolation and the mental health problems which loneliness can cause. \"It could also help alleviate the housing crisis for younger people trying to buy their first home. \"As we contemplate all those baby boomers reaching 85 in less than 20 years, we have time to plan and get it right. \"But it's time we got on with it.\" Nigel Crisp: A Health-Creating Society Lord Crisp was chief executive of the NHS between 2000 and 2006. He is an independent member of the House of Lords, and co-chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group on Global Health. \"The election of a new government is a great opportunity to change the direction and the mood for health provision in the UK. \"The World Health Organisation got it right when it said 'modern societies actively market unhealthy lifestyles'. We need to turn this round so we're creating healthy lifestyles. \"The NHS was a great coming together of everyone involved in health services to deliver healthcare to the whole population. We need all those parts of society that affect health to come together into a new compact. And we need to be explicit about this everywhere in the country. \"We need to release the NHS and the remarkable people in it to create a long-term plan for transition. There is already remarkable consensus about what needs to be done, and we need a transition fund to support development and the double running of services as changes are made. \"There's a wonderful African saying: 'health is made at home, hospital is for repairs'. Health is made at home, and in our communities. \"The NHS - with all the important services we all rely on - will only be sustainable if we all play our part in developing a health-creating society. \"We do know how to do it.

He was in hiding in Georgia throughout his trial in the UK for the manslaughter of Charlotte Brown. British Prime Minister Theresa May \"welcomes the news that he is now in custody\". One of Shepherd's defence lawyers told Tbilisi City Court on Friday he should not be extradited because he was warned in a phone call his life might be in danger if he goes to a UK jail. However, the Crown Prosecution Service said it was \"doing everything it can to help make sure Jack Shepherd faces justice through the proper legal channels\". Shepherd told the court he had been working in Georgia, and he greatly regretted going out on the speedboat, adding the accident had left him depressed and suicidal. The 31-year-old had been in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi since March, but he handed himself into police on Wednesday. Shepherd told the court: \"Not a single day passes when I don't think about the passing of Charlotte's life and the effect on her family.\" He also said he regretted not being at his UK trial. \"I wish I'd sat down with Charlotte's family to explain,\" he said. The court also heard that Shepherd had alcohol dependency and wanted to conduct the appeal against his conviction from Georgia. Shepherd met Ms Brown online and they went on a date on 8 December. Later in the evening he invited her on a speedboat he claimed he owned. The pair were thrown from the boat when it hit branches in the water near Wandsworth Bridge at about midnight. Ms Brown, from Clacton in Essex, was pulled from the water unconscious and unresponsive. A post-mortem examination found she died from cold water immersion. Shepherd made his first appearance at the Old Bailey on 26 January 2018, when he entered a not guilty plea to a charge of manslaughter by gross negligence. He was released on unconditional bail by Judge Richard Marks QC, but failed to show up for his trial and was sentenced to six years in July. Despite being on the run, Shepherd had won the right to appeal against his conviction. Mrs May \"welcomes the news that he is now in custody\", her official spokesman said. \"The government will now work alongside the police and the Crown Prosecution Service to ensure that extradition proceedings are expedited,\" he added. Shepherd's defence team did not challenge the ruling that he should be kept in custody while his extradition was pending. His lawyer in Georgia, Tariel Kakabadze, said: \"It's Jack Shepherd's decision not to fight for release on today's court session.\" Under Georgian law, he can be detained for up to nine months before extradition, he added. Shepherd is also being represented by Mariam Kublashvili, a lawyer who reportedly appeared on Georgia's version of Strictly Come Dancing, who told the BBC her client had been earning money making websites while in Georgia. Meanwhile, it emerged that Shepherd also faces a charge of GBH with intent following an alleged assault on 16 March 2018 in Moretonhampstead in Devon.

Previous hearings relating to the deaths of Pascal Le Floch and Yves Gloaguen have been in Truro, as their bodies were returned to Cornwall. The Ministry of Defence denies claims a Royal Navy submarine was involved. Three other men also died when the boat sank off the Lizard peninsula. One crew member's body was taken to France and the other two were never found. Judge Nigel Lickley QC, acting as coroner, said the \"long-delayed\" inquest would be a \"full, fair and rigorous investigation\". He added he was \"conscious the families want it brought to a conclusion\". The judge said a London location for the hearing was \"more convenient\" for those involved including relatives of those who died. The inquest is concerned with the deaths of two of the men, Mr Le Floch and Mr Gloaguen, whose bodies were taken by search and rescue helicopter to Cornwall. Relatives believe the trawler was dragged underwater when a submarine became snagged in its nets. France's top judicial court, the Court of Cassation, said in 2006 there was no evidence to support the submarine claim, nor that it was a fishing accident. In 2019, an inquest was partially held in Cornwall but was adjourned, and subsequently handed to a circuit judge by the chief coroner. Judge Lickley explained this was done as a \"judge can be given more information about matters of national security than a coroner\". This had enabled him to investigate further and establish there were no non-allied submarines in the area at the time of the sinking, he said. Oliver Hyams, counsel for the families, argued that there is \"credible expert evidence\" consistent with the submarine theory and that the issue should \"remain live\" for consideration in the inquest. Edward Pleeth, for the Ministry of Defence, said: \"There is no arguable evidence that a submarine made any contribution to the sinking of the vessel.\" The judge will decide whether to include the submarine theory in the inquest, and also whether a jury should be appointed as the relatives would prefer. A further pre-inquest review will be held later in the year, with the full inquest scheduled to start on 4 October.

It called for all detained children to be released immediately. PM Tony Abbott has called the report a blatant attack on his government. Mr Abbott said the commission \"should be ashamed of itself\" for being so partisan. Under his government the number of children in detention has fallen. Mr Abbott questioned why the HRC did not launch an inquiry when the Labor government was in power and there were almost 2,000 children in detention centres. Successive Australian governments have been criticised over their harsh asylum policies, under which asylum seekers are detained for long periods in offshore camps while their applications are processed. Opinion polls show that such policies are popular with voters concerned about asylum seekers arriving in Australia by boat. 'Cruel and illegal' The long-awaited report, entitled The Forgotten Children, was completed late last year and released by the government on Wednesday. It argues that there is no sensible explanation for the prolonged detention of children which is \"in clear violation of international human rights law\". \"The overarching finding of the enquiry is that the prolonged, mandatory detention of asylum-seeker children causes them significant mental and physical illness and developmental delays, in breach of Australia's international obligations,\" the foreword says. The report found that: It calls for the closure of immigration detention facilities on Christmas Island, an end to indefinite detentions and the replacement of the immigration minister by an independent person to act as guardian for unaccompanied children. \"The aims of stopping people smugglers and deaths at sea do not justify the cruel and illegal means adopted,\" Commission President Gillian Triggs wrote. \"Australia is better than this.\" Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said many of the recommendations in the report were unnecessary, while others \"would mean undermining the very policies that mean children don't get on boats in the first place\". Attorney General George Brandis said that the government did not accept the commission's conclusions. Australia currently detains all asylum seekers who arrive by boat, holding them in offshore processing camps. Those found to be refugees will not be permanently resettled in Australia. It also has a backlog of cases - about 30,000 - relating to asylum seekers who arrived before the current policies were put in place. Those people live in detention camps or in the community under bridging visas that do not allow them to work.

Among the 200 exhibits are a colour-changing portrait of the star by Michael Craig-Martin, a dove preserved in formaldehyde by Damien Hirst, and a life-size bronze gorilla by Angus Fairhurst, which used to live in Michael's garden. Austin, who rarely gives interviews, was Michael's childhood friend, songwriting partner and manager. He worked closely with the star's team to put the exhibition together, drawing on the times he'd accompany Michael to buy new works of art. \"I remember going down to the White Cube [gallery] one evening,\" he recalls. \"It was closed when we got there and we saw Damien Hirst's Saint Sebastian through the locked doors. \"I remember his disappointment at not being able to see it - but I also remember him buying it. It's such an imposing piece.\" The seven-tonne work restages the death of Christian martyr Saint Sebastian - traditionally depicted as a handsome young man pierced with arrows - using a bull encased in formaldehyde. Over time, the saint has become a gay icon (more through iconography than biography) and his quiet suffering resonated with Michael. The star was frequently drawn to mournful pieces, and the Christie's sale includes a haunting cast iron human sculpture by Antony Gormley, a pink coffin by Sarah Lucas, and an unsettling collage of broken mirrors and eyeballs by Jim Lambie. But Michael also had a love of life and a cheeky sense of humour, exemplified by the triptych Urinal and Sex and Handcuffs, a reference to the star's 1998 arrest for engaging in a sexual act in a public toilet. \"There's a humour about the art,\" agrees Austin. \"In actual fact, there's a quote of George's that we use in the exhibition where he sums it all up: 'I guess I'm just not afraid of being laughed at.'\" Generosity Austin accompanied Michael throughout his career, playing in his first band The Executive and joining Wham! for their Top of the Pops debut in 1982. After a brief attempt at his own pop career, he co-wrote songs including I Want Your Sex and You Have Been Loved, and latterly became the star's manager, \"although I hate that word because George really managed himself\". The art sale is the first public project since the star died as a result of heart and liver disease on Christmas Day 2016, aged 53. \"It does feel very personal walking around it, because George was such a private person,\" says Austin. All the money raised will go to charity, continuing the philanthropic work he started in his lifetime. After his death, it emerged that Michael had worked anonymously at a homeless shelter and donated millions to Childline - including the royalties from Jesus to a Child. \"He was a wonderful person,\" says Austin. \"A caring, kind, giving man. \"It never stops amazing me how he touched people and how much love there is for him.\" He remembers Michael's final months fondly. They would spend the days working on a documentary before retiring to Michael's home in Goring-on-Thames to play records or going out for dinner. \"I remember sitting in a restaurant one evening and people were looking across thinking, 'Ooh, it's George Michael!'\" he recalls. \"I got up to go to the toilet, and when I came back he was having a cup of tea with two women at the next table. They were just talking about life and their problems, and I was like, 'What is going on here?' \"That was a small moment, but it was important - because that's exactly who he was. Everybody warmed to him, from Princess Diana to those two women in the restaurant.\" After Michael died, Austin found himself unable to listen to his music until his phone accidentally started playing a live version of Praying For Time. \"I was in shock.

This December will also see the release of a film, Last Christmas, featuring nine of the musician's most famous songs. Starring Game of Thrones' Emilia Clarke and Crazy Rich Asians actor Henry Golding, the rom-com has been written by Emma Thompson and is directed by Paul Feig (Bridesmaids, Ghostbusters). \"I did the deal with Emma Thompson because I knew it would be a family film, I knew it would have absolutely massive reach, and we'd be rolling out year after year to a new demographic that would be listening to his music,\" says Austin. \"It's really taking a note out of George's book. He hated going around selling his wares and this film will do that job.\" Austin denies rumours of an all-star tribute concert but says there are other, secret projects in the works. \"There will be lots more happening in the future. Beautiful and significant stuff, too,\" he says. \"My job is just to make sure everybody hears that music and his legacy continues.\" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

As the sun goes down on this year's Love Island, we look back at the series' defining moments. 1. Hayley's Brexit chat A major political summit took place earlier this summer, featuring heavily in the news. There has been plenty of reporting on who's in, who's out and what aspects of trade and travel will be affected. No, not Theresa May's Chequers meeting, but the Love Island girls chatting Brexit. An early series highlight came when Hayley Hughes admitted she \"didn't have a clue\" what Brexit was. Trying to explain, Georgia says: \"Welfare, and like things we trade with would be cut down.\" Confused perhaps by the cutting down comment, Hayley responds: \"So does that mean we won't have any trees?\" \"Cheese?\" says Samira, adding to the general farce of the conversation. \"Why wouldn't we have trees?\" chimes in Dani. Things finally take a serious turn for Hayley when it's mooted that it may become more difficult for Brits to travel abroad. \"So it would be harder to go on holidays?\" says Hayley. \"Oh, I love my holidays!\" This Brexit thingy is serious stuff indeed. 2. Rosie confronting Adam One of the first truly explosive scenes came when Rosie Williams confronted Adam Collard over the way he had treated her following the arrival of newcomer Zara McDermott. After spending 10 days coupled up, Rosie told Adam he had \"hurt her\" and broken her heart, after ignoring her all day. Adam denied he'd done anything wrong and generally looked smug during the whole conversation. Cue Adam becoming public enemy number one - even prompting charity Women's Aid to issue a warning about his emotional abuse and gaslighting behaviour towards both Rosie and Kendall. 3. Georgia: she's loyal, babe If you didn't know after the (approximate) 2,643 times she mentioned it, Georgia is loyal. Babe. She even mentioned it four times back-to-back, so it must be true. Speaking - as she's cracking on with Idris - she says: \"Obviously I am very loyal. I'm a very loyal girl. Very loyal. And when I am with someone, I am completely loyal unless I am honest with them, tell them how I feel, then I crack on.\" Got it? Even during one of the other biggest moments of the series, when she may or may not have planted THAT KISS on Jack Fowler, she was - of course - still loyal. And that cheeky little peck went on to cause more trouble than it could possibly have been worth. Laura broke up with Jack (for not being loyal); Georgia and Laura fell out (over Laura questioning G's loyalty); and Ellie and Georgia had a bitter kitchen exchange (with Ellie claiming Georgia was, in fact, NOT loyal. Gasp!) In the words of Dua Lipa: One kiss is all it takes. 4. Dani shown footage of Jack at Casa Amor One of the biggest - and most complained about - must-see moments on television this year was the moment Dani saw footage of boyfriend Jack in Casa Amor with his ex Ellie. Dyer burst into tears at the video and took to the Love Island beach hut to share her agony. \"I just knew it was too good to be true,\" she sobbed. But the scenes sparked more than 2,600 complaints to Ofcom, as many thought the video Dyer was shown was misleading. In reality, Jack had also taken his bedding outside into the garden because he refused to share a bed with another girl, and told Adam he was in love with Dyer - but these excerpts had not been shown to her. Safe to say, they were happily reunited and it all turned out right in the end. 5. Megan: 'Kiss me' Megan played with fire when she entreated Wes to kiss her while he was still coupled up with Laura. In so doing, all manner of rules from the girl code could be heard smashing. To his credit, Wes didn't cheat on Laura, but told her he'd be \"getting to know Megan a whole lot more\" following the conversation. Understandably, Laura and Meg never really saw eye to eye afterwards. 6. The impressions In a scene that could have come straight from Emmerdale, the boys offered some light relief from all the drama when, out of nowhere, they all pretended to be from Yorkshire for a whole conversation. A sign of cabin fever perhaps, but it had us in hysterics. Likewise, Jack proved he was a dab hand at doing impressions of his fellow Islanders - with his and Dani's take-off of Eyal a real highlight. 7. Samira's shock exit Hitherto unlucky-in-love Samira finally found her Prince Charming in Frankie, but was left bereft when he was voted off the show. She told her fellow Islanders: \"So, these past couple of days I haven't been myself and I've struggled to be happy in here and have fun and I had a taste of what I've wanted and it's gone.\" So off she skipped out of the villa's front door in a tiny fuchsia bikini with her enormous suitcase. Wonder what airport security made of her outfit? 8. Charlie asking Ellie to be his girlfriend There was a lot of asking to be each other's significant others in the series. But the hands down most inventive example goes to Charlie Brake, who pulled off a master plan in cahoots with Wes, Jack Fincham and Alex. Operation Chellie involved derring-do in the guise of covert use of a lipstick, strategic spillage of red wine and copious usage of the word \"muggy\". One \"I've never been so shocked in my life\" and a \"yes\" later from Ellie and they had all jumped in the pool. Romeo done. 9. Dr Alex's Daddy day care disaster When tasked with the baby challenge, Dr Alex showed he wasn't quite cut out for fatherhood yet. During the task, in which the Islanders were given a baby doll to care for, the A&E doctor catapulted himself and his baby onto the floor during an impromptu buggy race with Jack Fincham. It left the 27-year old sprawling and the baby with (presumably) multiple serious injuries. Meanwhile, Josh proved to be the worst dad ever after pulling his baby's arm off. Fatherhood should definitely be put off a few years for this lot. 10. Dr Alex gets a grilling from Alexandra's mum After a rocky time together, Alexandra's mum showed her true sass when she came into the villa and called out Alex for his treatment of her daughter. \"He thought he could just drop you and pick you up at a whim, and that's not how life works,\" she fired. \"What did you expect a girl to feel like after she'd been rejected and then you deigned to bring her back to your side? I thought, 'hey young man, I'll have words with you!'\" Mother always knows best. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

He wants the Welsh Government to ban any new plants from being developed here, except for burning medical waste. It said they were a \"transitionary step\" but the long-term solution was to move away from single-use plastics. And others have argued more incinerators are needed if Wales is to achieve its ambition of becoming a \"zero waste\" nation by 2050. Mr Hedges, who has campaigned in the past against a proposed incinerator in his Swansea East constituency, said his main concern was around emissions. \"Some of it will be carbon dioxide which is very bad for global warming, some of it will be nitrous oxide and dioxins which we know are bad for health.\" \"Hospitals need them, they have to get rid of pathogens in some of the medical waste but there's no reason why domestic waste needs to be incinerated.\" \"Can we get on with reduction rather than looking for ways of getting rid of more and more waste?\" In the meantime, he said landfill was \"a slightly less bad option\". \"As long as you have it in an area that's secure it will stay there, instead of putting it out into the atmosphere that may do us harm.\" Another senior AM, Plaid Cymru's Dai Lloyd, chair of the assembly's health committee, also told BBC Wales he supported a ban on new incinerators. \"We must do everything we can to avoid more air pollution,\" Dr Lloyd said. \"The answer is to invest in specialist plants to recycle plastics in Wales, which we can't do at the moment.\" Conservative environment spokesman Andrew RT Davies repeated his calls for a moratorium on new large-scale incinerators until there was a national plan to deal with them. \"We believe there should be no development of large-scale incinerators in communities where there is no history of large waste businesses, or without comparable large scale industry and suitable infrastructure,\" he said. How many incinerators are there in Wales? There are two incinerators - or \"energy from waste\" plants - already operating in Wales and two more have been built. Crymlyn Burrows in Swansea opened in 2002 to deal with waste from Neath Port Talbot and Bridgend, although it has been forced to close on occasions in past years for breaching the emission limit for dioxins. Trident Park, operated by Viridor near Splott, Cardiff, deals with 172,000 tonnes of waste a year from five councils - and generates 250 GWh of electricity for the National Grid. The developers behind a controversial incinerator at Barry Dock hope to be up and running by the end of the year. Meanwhile the \u00a3800m Parc Adfer plant on Deeside is expected to be operational by the end of 2019 and will process 200,000 tonnes of waste a year from Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Gwynedd and Anglesey, that would otherwise end up in landfill. A Wheelabrator Technologies spokeswoman said once fully operational the plant would generate enough renewable energy to meet the needs of more than 30,000 homes and businesses. \"In addition Parc Adfer will enable recycling of valuable materials and has already created opportunities for a wide range of local suppliers and supply chain companies,\" she said. Six more proposals are at various stages on the road in the planning process. They include revived plans for a plant on the site of the old Llynfi power station near Llangynwyd, Bridgend, controversial proposals which have been rejected by planners for Llansamlet, Swansea and a \u00a3150m plant at Wentloog on the outskirts of Cardiff. What are the arguments in favour? Recycle for Wales, a national campaign funded by the Welsh Government, argues that improvements in technology and regulation mean incineration emissions have fallen significantly in recent decades, and the plants also turn waste into renewable electricity and heat. It claims landfill is not a sustainable option for dealing with our rubbish as space is running out, and it also creates methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. Robin Latchem, a former editor of trade journal Materials Recycling World said incineration played \"a key part in making sure nothing goes to landfill\". More plants would be required, he predicted, as the commercial and industrial sectors are weaned off sending their waste to be buried. \"We don't want to stick it in the ground or send it abroad, so until you and I get much better at recycling, and the manufacturers and all the people in the supply chains make their packaging easier to recycle and make less of it - you have to incinerate.\" \"It's a stop-gap, a shock absorber.\" The \"bad press\" incinerators have received could be addressed, he suggested, if developers and local authorities were \"a lot smarter about what the plants do once they're installed\" such as providing affordable heating for communities so they see the benefits \"in their pockets\". The Welsh Government has set a limit on the amount of household rubbish that can be sent to incinerators until 2025. \"As a responsible nation, we want to deal effectively with our non-recyclable waste in a way which prevents it from either polluting the environment or sees the problem being exported,\" a spokesman said. \"For this reason we have invested in infrastructure to extract electricity and heat from this material and dispose of it safely, to the highest environmental standards.\" Councils are allowed to send up to 30% of household waste to be turned into power or heat, in order to encourage efforts to recycle the rest. 'Last century's technology' Plans to expand a private gasification plant in the Usk Valley have led campaigners to present a 1000-signature petition to Monmouthshire council. David Morgan of Trostrey Court near Llancayo hopes to turn waste wood and non-recyclable plastics, into electricity for his farm and the National Grid. Lindsey Williams, who is coordinating the campaign group's efforts, said it was worried about air pollution and carbon emissions from the site. It comes at a time when the council has declared its own \"climate emergency\". \"It's ridiculous for the council to try to reduce its emissions on the one hand and then think of approving a plant like this on the other,\" Mrs Williams said. \"That's even before we start to think about traffic and the visual impact of an industrial plant in the valley.\" \"We think gasification is last century's technology and involves bringing waste long distances.\" Mr Morgan told BBC Wales his planning application was simply for a storage building for the fuel. The generator itself has already been built, with all relevant consents in place. He claims the site has been operational for the last four years, though the campaigners dispute this. An environmental report prepared on his behalf and submitted to the council concluded emissions were likely to be \"negligible\" and the effect of production processes \"well below\" relevant critical levels at nearby sensitive ecological sites.", "output": "Waste: Landfill a 'better option' than burning, says AM", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

It was the first time an entire joint surface had been regenerated with the return of functions, they said. The research could benefit patients with damaged hips, shoulders or knees. The team removed the limbs from 10 rabbits and replaced them with an artificial limb-shaped skeleton. This was soaked with chemicals which attract bone and cartilage stem cells. Four weeks later the rabbits had regrown their joints and were able to move normally. \"This is the first time an entire joint surface was regenerated with return of functions including weight bearing and locomotion,\" said Professor Jeremy Mao of Columbia University Medical Center, New York. \"Regeneration of cartilage and bone both from the host's own stem cells, rather than taking stem cells out of the body, may ultimately lead to clinical applications. In patients who need the knee, shoulder, hip or finger joints regenerated, the rabbit model provides a proof of principle,\" he said. Researchers have artificially grown a range of tissue on scaffolding using stem cells for many years, but these have been grown in laboratories. The lab grown tissue has been quite small and has had no veins or arteries to supply them with blood. More recently, however, several groups of researchers have successfully grown tissue inside animals, where blood vessels naturally form as the tissue grows. The US group is the latest to have shown that this is a promising technique - and is the first to have grown a large amount of good quality bone and cartilage into successful working joints. 'Too old' According to Professor Patrick Warnke, a stem cell researcher and plastic surgeon at Bond University in Australia, there is technically no reason why trials should not begin on human patients, for example as an alternative to hip replacements. But he said there were ethical issues to be considered before beginning clinical trials. \"A hip replacement would definitely cure any potential recruit to any clinical trial. On the other hand you have an experimental treatment that may turn out to be a better option - but may not work at all,\" he said. If human trials were to be approved they would not be suitable for very old patients, according to Professor Warnke. \"It would take months of movement, physiotherapy and bed rest for the joint to grow which would be much too long for older people. They would be better off with a normal hip replacement when they can walk out of the hospital after the procedure.\" Professor Molly Stevens of Imperial College London said: \"Growing large areas of tissue is a massively important clinical goal. \"This is the latest study to have shown that there are stem cells in the body that can be harnessed to grow bone and tissue if they are given the right sort of signals.\"", "output": "Hip hope from stem cell technique", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

No representatives from any other political party appear to have attended his funeral in Glasgow. Newspaper tributes were hostile and unforgiving, with one saying he was one of the most hated men of his time. Keir Hardie died virtually penniless and a public appeal had to be launched to help his family. However, by 1956 a statue of him was placed in the House of Commons. At the time, Clement Atlee, the post-war Labour prime minister, said: \"Mr Speaker, I think this is the first time that a bust has been placed in the House of Commons of a member of the working class. \"Hardie was not only born of the working class, he remained of the working class.\" Atlee added: \"Few members of parliament had a greater effect upon the House of Commons than Keir Hardie. \"Before the end of the 19th Century parliament consumed itself very little with the life of the common people of our country. \"The turning point came at the end of that century and Hardie symbolised that change.\" Hardie's life began in great poverty. He was born illegitimate on 15 August 1856, near Newhouse in Lanarkshire, the son of Mary Keir, a domestic servant, and William Aitken, a miner who wanted nothing to do with him. Soon Mary Keir married David Hardie, a ship's carpenter, and James Keir took his stepfather's name and became James Keir Hardie. The family had to move from place to place as his stepfather failed to find regular employment and their poverty forced young Hardie out to work at the age of eight - first as a message boy, then at a bakery, then heating rivets in a shipyard where the boy next to him fell off a scaffold and was killed. In desperation, his father returned to work at sea. His mother moved back to Lanarkshire and at the age of 10, Hardie went down the mines where he worked as a \"trapper\", operating the ventilation doors deep underground. \"I am of the unfortunate class who never knew what it was to be a child,\" Hardie wrote. \"For several years as a child I rarely saw daylight during the winter months. \"Down the pit by six in the morning and not leaving it again until half past five meant not seeing the sun.\" Hardie had no formal schooling but his mother spent evenings patiently teaching him to read and write. And because of his stepfather's drinking, his mother steered the young Hardie towards the temperance movement. In his teenage years he was a member of the evangelical union in Hamilton, an organisation with strong links to the temperance movement. His preaching helped him learn the art of public speaking and the mine workers of the area soon co-opted him to speak for their grievances. \"He described himself as an agitator,\" says Melissa Benn, writer and honorary president of the Keir Hardie Society. Bitter strike His agitating got him banned by mine owners from working in the pits in Lanarkshire and Ayrshire but instead he turned his attentions to organising the miners in a trade union. He led a bitter strike in Lanarkshire which failed, but then accepted a call to relocate to Cumnock in Ayrshire to organise miners there. Hardie had been a supporter of the Liberal Party but when in 1887 a miners' strike in Lanarkshire was broken because the iron companies imported the police into the coal field he decided radical action was needed. Warwick University lecturer Fred Reid says Hardie was \"absolutely furious\" and realised the Liberal Party was not going to deliver fundamental social change. In a series of editorials in the Miner, a magazine that Hardie set up, he declared his new vision. Reid says: \"Hardie says we need a Labour Party, pure and simple.\" \"He says in the same editorial it should have two aims. \"The first is it should aim to replace the historic Liberal Party and the second thing is he lays down a programme for this new party. \"It includes the legal minimum wage and the legal eight-hour day and it includes the nationalisation of the mines, minerals and railways.\" He tried to get elected to parliament in a Scottish seat but instead he finally succeeded in becoming an MP in West Ham in London in 1892. He became known as the member for the unemployed and helped create the Independent Labour Party in 1893. Keir Hardie caused consternation by entering parliament in a \"cloth cap\" at a time where everyone else wore a top hat. A year later he became even more controversial when, after a mining disaster in Wales, he tried to amend the statement following the birth of the prince who would become Edward VIII with a message of condolence to miners families. No-one would second his motion and the speech made him deeply unpopular and may have contributed to him losing his seat in West Ham in 1895. He re-entered parliament as MP for Merthyr Tydfil in 1900. Hardie became increasingly disgusted by the behaviour of fellow MPs. He wrote: \"More and more the House of Commons tends to become a putrid mass of corruption, a quagmire of sordid madness, a conglomeration of mercenary spiritless hacks dead alike to honour and self-respect.\" So determined was Hardie to deliver a Labour Party in parliament that in 1904, he and Ramsay Macdonald, the future Labour prime minister, made a secret electoral pact with the Liberal Party and, as a result, 29 Labour MPs were elected in 1906. The parliamentary Labour Party was formed and Keir Hardie became its first leader. He toured the country campaigning for the new Labour party but years of travel round the country had taken its toll. Hardie suffered a breakdown in his health and resigned as Labour leader in 1908. He continued to support causes such as votes for women. The disappointment of the outbreak of World War One had a great affect on him, destroying his ideas of a universal brotherhood of men in Europe. Within a few days of Britain going into the war he was speaking at his own constituency and he was shouted down by the crowd who supported the war. He died on 26 September 1915, aged only 59.

Mrs May told MPs if any of them had British visas, they would be revoked. The PM said the claim the journalist had died in a fight was not credible and there was an \"urgent need\" to establish what had happened. Two senior officials have been removed from their posts after the Saudi authorities admitted that Mr Khashoggi had died during an incident in its consulate in Istanbul. Mrs May told MPs that the Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, was taking action against all suspects to prevent them entering the UK. This follows a similar move by the United States. The PM also confirmed that no UK minister or official was attending the so-called \"Davos in the desert\" conference currently taking place in Riyadh. The event was intended to showcase Saudi Arabia's attempts at domestic reform and attract foreign investment to the country, but has been boycotted by leading politicians and companies. Downing Street has declined to comment on the number of individuals to whom visa restrictions would apply, but said it was speaking to the US and other allies about its response. Later on Wednesday, the prime minister spoke to King Salman, the head of Saudi Arabia's ruling family, by telephone to reiterate the UK's \"grave concerns\" about the murder of Mr Khashoggi, Downing Street said. A spokeswoman said: \"The prime minister said the current explanation lacks credibility so there remains an urgent need to establish exactly what happened \"She strongly urged Saudi Arabia to cooperate with the Turkish investigation and to be transparent about the results.\" Labour has called for much stronger action against the Saudi authorities, including a ban on all UK arms sales to the desert kingdom and an end to the UK's backing for the Saudi-led bombing campaign against Houthi insurgents in Yemen. A spokesman for its leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Khashoggi's killing was \"a shocking act by a dictatorial regime involved in multiple human rights abuses at home and abroad\".

Claim: India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, says waiving loans for farmers is not really a solution, comparing it to handing out \"lollipops\" at election time. But the Congress opposition says its proposed loan waivers would be an effective means of helping farmers in need. Verdict: The evidence from loan schemes implemented in the past suggests they don't address the deep-rooted problems facing farmers. Governments of all colours - both at the national and state level - have written off loans. Between 2014 and 2018, loan waivers were announced in 11 states, by both BJP and Congress administrations, at a total cost of more than a trillion rupees (\u00a310bn). What problems do farmers face? Over 40% of India's workforce is employed in agriculture. Farmers sometimes borrow heavily to buy seeds, equipment and other essentials but then struggle with debt. Poor harvests due to bad weather can devastate crops, leading to financial disaster and in some cases to farmers killing themselves. One report last year said levels of debt in rural India had been rising in recent decades, notably in those households engaged in farming. In recent years, farmers have also seen relatively small increases in real wages and stagnant or falling crop prices. Does writing off debts work? But it's far from clear whether debt relief schemes actually help farmers in distress. For one thing, the link between indebtedness and farmer suicide is far from straightforward. Suicide is often higher in wealthier states. And within those states, the wealthier farmers rather than the poorest with the most debts are more likely to kill themselves. There are other questions too about the effectiveness of debt relief schemes. After a nationwide loan waiver in 1990, evidence emerged of a decline in the rate of recovery of non-waived loans by financial institutions. It suggested that loan waivers created expectations of future write-offs, leaving borrowers with little incentive to pay back existing loans. In one state, the loan recovery rate fell from nearly 75% to just over 40% in the year after a loan waiver had been announced. A further nationwide scheme - worth 515bn rupees - was announced in 2008 ahead of general elections the following year. But a subsequent government audit concluded that it had been poorly implemented. This included money being given to farmers who were ineligible and some farmers who were eligible not receiving anything. Critics of these schemes have also pointed out that many famers borrow informally from family, friends or local money lenders and do not therefore benefit from the loan waivers. Supporting the rural economy Some farmers' groups and lobbyists have been calling for a one-off write-off of all farmers' debts, and then a rethink of how best to support the agricultural economy. But waiving all loans could turn out to be hugely expensive. One estimate - by former Agriculture Secretary Siraj Hussain - puts the cost of a one-off nationwide debt relief payment as high as 3bn rupees. \"This amount could only be freed up at the expense of other welfare programmes,\" he told BBC News. Other ideas for relieving farmer distress are now being implemented. One example is in the southern state of Telangana, where all farmers owning at least an acre (4,000 sq m) of land receive a guaranteed subsidy each growing season. Other states have implemented similar projects and in February this year the federal government announced a plan to support small-scale farmers across the country with a guaranteed annual income support of about 6,000 rupees. Tens of millions of farmers have received the first instalment.

But he also said he believes decisions were correct based on the information available at the time. There have been 4,775 deaths with Covid-19 in Wales since March 2020. There have also been 192,912 positive cases recorded. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said objections were raised to decisions taken at the start of the pandemic. Wales went into its first lockdown on 23 March and the Welsh Government came under fire early on for the speed of care home testing, as well as contact tracing. \"Looking back, if we had the opportunity to do this all again, we would have made different choices on borders definitely,\" Mr Gething said. \"We would almost certainly have entered lockdown a week or two earlier, and we would have probably saved more lives if we had done that. \"I think that actually on the really big and serious choices we have learned lots. \"So if we have the knowledge we have now I would definitely have made different choices at various points in the pandemic. \"We'd have been able to get a jump-start on our testing capacity. \"We'd have been able to make different choices about testing around care homes earlier. \"We did manage to get ourselves into a good position on PPE so we never ran out, but it was really tight at various points in time.\" He said the Welsh Government's scientific advisors all agreed the advice given at the time was the correct advice based on the information they had. However, if they had the information they now possess, the advice would have been different. Mr Gething admitted being at the sharp end of decision-making at such a critical time had taken its toll. \"If you're having conversation with needing to plan for the potential for mass burial as we were at the start of the pandemic, then you know that really sobers you up very quickly about the scale and the enormity of the challenge we're facing,\" he said. \"I never really thought that I would have to make decisions that have this sort of consequence. \"We often talk about making life and death decisions but actually the choices we make have an impact on the whole population.\" 'Awful lot more pressure' \"During the pandemic making the right choice can mean that you're saving lots of lives, and making a different choice means that you can end up thinking that, that choice I made may not have been the right one. \"So there's an awful lot more pressure. \"We've lost well over 4,000 Welsh citizens to the pandemic. But it could have been much, much worse. \"Without the action we have taken I'm confident that we'd have lost more people.\" The Welsh Government had received praise over its slower approach to easing lockdown restrictions than England but drew criticism in other areas such as easing restrictions too quickly after November's firebreak. It was also criticised early into the vaccine rollout because of its pace, but the vaccination rate is now higher than other parts of the UK, and 416,306 first doses have been given. \"To make decisions in government has been an extraordinary period of time as well and you learn not just by getting things right,\" said Mr Gething. \"You also learn by making mistakes as well.\" As well as mistakes on decisions during the pandemic, Mr Gething has also faced a couple of difficult personal moments including being accused by a newspaper of breaking lockdown rules when he ate chips on a park bench with his family. He also came under fire while grappling with new online meetings when he left his microphone on and was caught swearing about a Labour colleague. \"We shouldn't try to pretend that everything has been perfect,\" Mr Gething said about the Welsh Government's overall response to the pandemic. \"But no one's had to do this before. I just think that sort of honesty is really important for people.\" In response to the interview, Mr Price tweeted: \"Being too slow into lockdown and coming out of the firebreak without a gradual approach has undoubtedly cost lives. \"Early abandonment of test and trace and the failure to test properly in care homes were avoidable and costly mistakes. \"It's not enough to argue, as the PM does, that government acted on the best evidence at the time, as many of us raised objections to these policies at the time.\" Your story Travel is currently limited to essential purposes in Wales, such as for work and caring responsibilities, and international travel is barred. But, after a tough year with the pandemic, many people will be dreaming about a holiday in 2021. While bookings for UK staycations are \"coming in thick and fast\", some people are gambling on a foreign trip in the hope restrictions will ease later this year.

It will also allow children to create a profile so that clinicians know things such as their favourite colour. Later, it may be used to offer insights into treatments. Watson is an AI platform that is already advising doctors on treatments in a dozen cancer hospitals in the US, trawling through data - it can read 40 million documents in 15 seconds - to offer insights into possible treatments. It may eventually do similar things at Alder Hey but is starting with a more simple patient/doctor app, designed to make hospital visits run more smoothly. The hospital is working with the UK's Science and Technology Facilities Council's (STFC) Hartree Centre on developing the app. For the next few months, hundreds of Alder Hey patients and their parents will be asked a range of questions on everything from parking, to what they would like to eat, to their favourite games and films, and what they want their bedroom to look like. They will also be asked what questions they have about clinical procedures, general anaesthetic, and surgery. A team of experts from the Hartree Centre and IBM, will use this information to train \"Watson\" to anticipate and respond to questions from patients and families before they come into hospital. Mr Iain Hennessey, a paediatric surgeon and director of innovation at Alder Hey, told the BBC: \"Helping our patients and their families prepare properly for coming into hospital will really reduce their anxiety and could mean we can get them better and home faster. \"So much of medicine is about looking after people. It is roughly a third of what we do and it is a neglected part. How we communicate with patients hasn't changed much over the last 100 years. A leaflet is seen as cutting edge and a website of patient information is award-winning.\" He said that later, the platform may offer \"more hardcore diagnostics\" but said governance around using patient data was \"a nightmare\". \"I wanted to get this off the ground quickly and using patient records takes time, is costly and can cause controversy. Alder Hey is famous for caring and that's what I wanted to build on.\" Future applications could include summaries of patient notes, spotting trends across the hospital and the AI could even be used to offer treatment and care options. IBM's European director for Watson, Paul Chong, commented: \"I'm thrilled to see IBM Watson technology applied to help doctors and their patients in the effort to improve the lives of children and their families.\"", "output": "AI patient app launched at Alder Hey hospital", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Labour had called on peers to block new regulations that \"let the privatisation genie fully out of the bottle\". But ministers won a key Lords vote. Peers voted by 254 to 146, a government majority of 108, in support of the new regulations. 'Massively changed' As the upper House debated the changes on Tuesday, Labour health spokesman Lord Hunt of Kings Heath warned: \"These regulations are vital. \"The problem is that they hold open the door to a competitive, marketised service in which I am afraid that, despite the wording that has been used tonight, the interests of patients will be not first but last.\" They removed the discretion of commissioners to decide when to offer services out to tender, he claimed. \"We face the prospect of NHS services being placed in the middle of a costly bidding war with private companies, discrete services cherry-picked for profit while the NHS is left to run the more complex and expensive services but with less money,\" the Labour peer added. \"How can that possibly be in the best interests of patients?\" Former cabinet minister Lord Owen predicted that the rules would leave the NHS \"massively changed\". He explained: \"It will take five, 10, 15 or maybe 20 years, but unless we pull back from his whole attitude there will be no NHS that any of us can recognise, and tonight I feel one feeling only: overwhelming sadness.\" But Health Minister Earl Howe said: \"There is no government agenda to privatise NHS services - quite the contrary.\" He added: \"The basic purpose of the regulations is to prevent commissioners failing to think about how the needs of their patients can best be met.\" Crossbench peer Lord Walton of Detchant, a former president of organisations including the British Medical Association and the Royal Society of Medicine, told peers: \"I am satisfied, after the most earnest and careful consideration, that these regulations do not produce the prospect of privatisation of the NHS.\" The coalition government's reforms to the NHS, dubbed the \"most radical\" in the organisation's history, came into force this month. 'Market tendering' More than 200 new organisations were created, including a network of GP-led commissioning groups, to manage the budget, and NHS England, the national board that will oversee the revised system. In March, Health Minister Norman Lamb announced that the government had decided to amend the National Health Service (Procurement, Patient Choice and Competition) Regulations. The coalition said these changes would help \"ensure that commissioners' decisions on buying clinical services are transparent and fair, and that they improve the quality and efficiency of health care services for patients\". But Labour argues that the regulations \"mandate market tendering on the medical profession in all but the most exceptional circumstances\". Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: \"NHS privatisation is already proceeding at an alarming pace. If passed, these regulations will let the privatisation genie fully out of the bottle.\" He had called on peers \"to stop this relentless march of privatisation to the heart of the NHS. \"The prime minister needs to be reminded that he does not have permission from the British people to put their NHS up for sale.\" On Monday, Labour leader Ed Miliband said \"massive increases\" in spending on the NHS \"won't be available\" were his party to win the next general election.", "output": "Peers support government on NHS despite Labour 'privatisation' warnings", "category": "Title Generation 475.json"}]
