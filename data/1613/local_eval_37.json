In Europe, where primogeniture governs succession to all monarchies except those of the Papacy and Andorra, the eldest son or eldest child of the current monarch fills the role of crown prince or princess, depending upon whether females of the dynasty enjoy personal succession rights. The eldest living child of a monarch is sometimes not the heir apparent or crown prince, because that position can be held by a descendant of a deceased older child who, by \"right of representation\", inherits the same place in the line of succession that would be held by the ancestor if he or she were still living.Cassandra:;Type: Opera Character. ;", "output": "Who is the sibling of [Cassandra] that is a [Crown prince]?, [Cassandra] has which sibling that is a [Crown prince]?, Which brother of [Cassandra] is a [Crown prince]?, What sibling of [Cassandra] is a [Crown prince]?, Who is a sibling of [Cassandra] and is also a [Crown prince]?, Which sibling of [Cassandra] is also a [Crown prince]?", "category": "Question Rewriting 1030.json"}, {"instruction": "Compose a new way to ask the same question.

All CGS mechanical units are unambiguously derived from these three base units, but there are several different ways of extending the CGS system to cover electromagnetism. The CGS system has been largely supplanted by the MKS system based on the metre, kilogram, and second, which was in turn extended and replaced by the International System of Units. In many fields of science and engineering, SI is the only system of units in use but there remain certain subfields where CGS is prevalent. In measurements of purely mechanical systems, the differences between CGS and SI are straightforward and rather trivial; the unit-conversion factors are all powers of 10 as 100 cm = 1 m and 1000 g = 1 kg. For example, the CGS unit of force is the dyne which is defined as 1 g\u00ac\u2211cm/s\u00ac\u2264, so the SI unit of force, the newton, is equal to 100,000 dynes.
