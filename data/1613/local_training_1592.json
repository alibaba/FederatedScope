The recombinant plasmid pVAX-M was transformed by electroporation into attenuated S. typhimurium SL7207, and the expression and translation of the pVAX-M delivered by recombinant S. typhimurium SL7207 (pVAX-M) was detected both in vitro and in vivo. BALB/c mice were inoculated orally with SL7207 (pVAX-M) at different dosages to evaluate safety of the vaccines. The bacterium was safe to mice at a dosage of 2 9 10 9 CFU, almost eliminated from the spleen and liver at week 4 post-immunization and eventually cleared at week 6. Mice immunized with 1 9 10 9 CFU of SL7207 (pVAX-M) elicited specific anti-TGEV local mucosal and humoral responses including levels of IgA, IgG, IL-4, and IFN-c as measured by indirect ELISA assay.

Objectives: To assess the proportion of influenza-like illness (ILI) attributable to influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and picornavirus infection during the winter season. To compare the influenza PCR data with serology of paired blood samples. Study design: Combined nose and throat swabs, from patients with ILI attending 15 general practices across Scotland, were submitted to the laboratory in virus PCR sample solution (VPSS). The extracted nucleic acid was tested using a multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Serological analysis was performed on paired serum samples using complement fixation assays. The rate of influenza virus positivity was compared with reports of ILI obtained from the SSGP network. Results: Of 240 samples received at the laboratory, 132 (55%) were PCR positive for influenza A virus. There were nine (3.8%) picornavirus and three (1.2%) RSV PCR positives, two (0.8%) were dual influenza A/picornavirus infections. Ninety four (39.2%) were negative for all viruses tested. Results on paired sera from 89 patients showed a rising titre to influenza A in 48 of the 57 PCR positive samples (84.2%). One PCR negative patient displayed a significant rising titre to influenza A. Virological data paralleled the SSGP data but was available at least a week earlier. Conclusions: Influenza A infection was detected in the majority of patients with ILI; picornavirus infection was also shown to be an important cause of illness. PCR is a rapid and sensitive method for respiratory virus surveillance. Serology is slow, insensitive and difficult to interpret at low titres.", "output": "1 - background, 2 - background, 3 - purpose, 4 - purpose, 5 - purpose, 6 - method, 7 - method, 8 - method, 9 - method, 10 - method, 11 - method, 12 - finding, 13 - finding, 14 - finding, 15 - finding, 16 - finding, 17 - finding, 18 - finding, 19 - finding, 20 - finding, 21 - finding", "category": "Section Classification 980.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a paragraph (from a research paper) and your task is to classify each sentence of the paragraph (assume n sentence) into the following categories: Background, Purpose, Method, Finding/Contribution, or Other.

A synthetic peptide whose linear sequence is identical to the 24 a.a. carboxy-terminal portion of the spike protein (S-CT24) elicited a strong antibody response in BALB/c mice that had specific reactivity against the S-CT24 and PEDV. These antibodies were shown to have a specific affinity to the GPRLQPY motif, as demonstrated by non-reactivity with a peptide that lacks this motif. In addition, antiS-CT24 antibodies exhibited neutralizing activities against KPEDV-9 in focus reduction neutralization tests suggesting that the GPRLQPY motif induces neutralizing antibodies against PEDV.", "output": "1 - background, 2 - method, 3 - finding, 4 - finding, 5 - finding, 6 - finding", "category": "Section Classification 980.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a paragraph (from a research paper) and your task is to classify each sentence of the paragraph (assume n sentence) into the following categories: Background, Purpose, Method, Finding/Contribution, or Other.

Editor: Edmundo Calva ABSTRACT A distinct difference between veterinary and human medicine is the routine use of antimicrobial mass medications (prophylaxis, metaphylaxis) to healthy individuals. The need for antimicrobial mass medications is based on beliefs that group/s of animals will contract a bacterial disease (i.e. morbidity) and/or die (i.e. mortality). Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) represents the major indication for cattle antimicrobials worldwide. The objectives were to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) for naturally occurring BRD investigating antimicrobial prophylaxis/metaphylaxis to prevent morbidity/mortality. In total, 58 publications met the inclusion criteria summarizing 169 individual RCTs, spanning 50 years . Antimicrobial prophylaxis and metaphylaxis demonstrated moderate, yet highly variable relative risk reductions in BRD morbidity. These were dependent on the antimicrobial classes used, dependent on metaphylaxis definition, BRD attack rates and duration of the RCTs. Best relative risk reductions were from broad-spectrum critically important antimicrobials, or combinations. BRD prophylaxis/metaphylaxis represents major antimicrobial consumption for highly variable short-term gains in absolute risk reduction of morbidity/mortality. Despite widespread use of prevention products, the need for antimicrobial mass medications should be re-evaluated since the underlying problem is more likely the segmented infrastructure of the feedlot and veal calf industries compared to the disease itself.", "output": "1 - background, 2 - background, 3 - background, 4 - background, 5 - purpose, 6 - method, 7 - finding, 8 - finding, 9 - finding, 10 - finding, 11 - finding, 12 - finding, 13 - finding, 14 - finding", "category": "Section Classification 980.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a paragraph (from a research paper) and your task is to classify each sentence of the paragraph (assume n sentence) into the following categories: Background, Purpose, Method, Finding/Contribution, or Other.
