Would it be better to cook it in a 170 degree oven since the steam pressure raises the temp to perhaps something just under boil?", "output": "If braised meat is cooked at 200 degrees in a perfectly sealed pouch in the oven, does the temperature rise above boiling?", "category": "Question Generation 733.json"}, {"instruction": "Given the background description of some cooking related query, summarize the question into a title", "input": "I'm making a tomato sauce cold from tinned tomatoes and I was going to add tomato puree to thicken the sauce.
