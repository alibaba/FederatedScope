He said that the move doesn't just send a message, but amounts to a \"significant degrading\" of Assad's ability to carry out chemical attacks.Rubio said Russians had put themselves into harm's wayHe said the strikes indicated a firm US stance against Assad's reign \n Question:\"I'll let them speak for their policy, but tonight's actions show that the days of being able to act with impunity are over when it comes to _-Assad,\" Rubio said.", "output": "Bashar al", "category": "Question Answering 967.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be presented with a passage and have to answer a question based on your understanding of the events inferred from the passage.
