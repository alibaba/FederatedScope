The Forest Health Initiative in 1993 alluded to the fact that during the Pot Hole lake fire the spruce Bark Beetle trees actually slowed the path of fire.  It declared the cure is worse than the disease.\nThe Timber Task Force and the State foresters on the other hand pushed hard using scare tactics to open logging as fast as possible.
