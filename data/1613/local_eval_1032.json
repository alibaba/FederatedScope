ATL head Mary Bousted said some pupils had a \"total disregard\" for school rules. They were as likely to be \"overindulged middle class\" pupils as disadvantaged ones, she added. The teaching union surveyed 814 teachers and support staff at UK schools on the issue, and heard tales of violence in the classroom. More than half said they felt behaviour had worsened in the past five years. One teaching assistant at a state primary in England said: \"A pupil once hit me in the back totally unexpectedly, because I asked her to put a book away. I was so winded and hurt that I couldn't carry on that day.\" Another, at a school in Wales, said: \"I had a female student threaten to kick the smile off my face, in front of the whole class.\" While a teacher at an English state secondary recalled \"six boys refusing to work, throwing glue, pens, fighting and throwing books\". When teachers were asked about the root cause of poor behaviour, three-quarters (72.9%) blamed a lack of positive role models at home. And nearly two-thirds (62.7%) said that breakdown of relationships within a family was a main cause. 'Lack of respect' Some 73% said pupils behaved badly because they were seeking attention from their classmates and 42% blamed neglect at home as a factor. A member of a school management team in England said: \"A change in pupils' behaviour is not helped by the lack of respect that parents show towards staff in school - there is no wonder that some pupils are rude when this is what they see as a role model.\" Dr Bousted said: \"A minority of children are very aware of their rights, have a total disregard for school rules and are rather less aware of their responsibility for their own learning and how to show respect to staff and other students. \"This can apply as much to overindulged middle class children as those from challenging families. \"It is not surprising to see that poor behaviour is often attributed to problems at home. \"Teachers need to work with parents to encourage good behaviour and parents should be acting as good role models by supporting staff and helping them create a more positive learning environment for their children.\" A Department for Education spokesman said: \"Unless there is good behaviour in schools, teachers cannot teach and students cannot learn. We want to put teachers back in control of the classroom. \"That is why we are toughening up discipline powers so that teachers are better able to deal quickly with bad behaviour. \"Schools can now issue no notice detentions, we have clarified the guidance on use of force and we are giving teachers more search powers.\"", "output": "Poor parenting and family breakdown is fuelling a rise in violent bad behaviour in UK schools, a survey says.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "Channel 4's Dispatches highlighted the thousands of tickets, for acts including Coldplay and Take That, sold in this way for inflated prices. Viagogo said it aimed \"to ensure that if you buy a ticket you get a ticket in time for the event\". It earlier failed in a High Court bid to stop the programme airing. The company had sought an injunction on the grounds of breach of commercial confidence. The High Court held the material was not commercially confidential and even if it had been, it would have been in the public interest to report. The issue of reselling concert tickets is a divisive one, with opponents complaining that desperate fans often have to pay over-inflated prices. 'Premium partner' On Thursday night's Dispatches programme, fans were shown complaining that tickets were resold at higher prices on secondary ticketing websites within minutes of events selling out. They also complained that they had believed they were buying from other fans, rather than promoters, and said they had less chance of buying tickets at face value. Dispatches alleged that Live Nation, which works with artists including Madonna and U2, and SJM Concerts, which works with One Direction and Jessie J, had allocated large numbers of tickets to Viagogo. Viagogo UK director Ed Parkinson told the BBC News website its business model was to \"guarantee that buyers get their tickets and sellers get paid\". \"We allow anyone to sell on our marketplace and the overwhelming majority of our sellers are individuals but it also includes larger sellers which can include concert promoters. \"We don't discriminate. We allow anyone to sell on our market place as long as they deliver the tickets that they sell.\" Music fans on the Dispatches programme also complained that some desirable tickets at concerts, including for front row seats, were put straight onto ticketing websites. Mr Parkinson said that, as a \"premium ticketing partner\" to a number of promoters and organisations, \"this will mean that certain premium seats will be made available to us\". Viagogo makes money by taking a cut of a ticket's selling price. A spokeswoman said the same rate applied to tickets sold by major concert promoters as those sold by individual music fans. But she could not comment on any further deals made with partners. Neither Live Nation nor SJM Concerts have commented on the practice but the Concert Promoters Association (CPA), of which both are members, said some promoters \"at least in part, operate in the secondary market\". It said this was because the last government had failed to outlaw the resale of concert tickets, despite lobbying from the CPA. \"If promoters put tickets into the secondary market then the result is that prices are brought down whilst also ensuring that some of the tickets available in the secondary are actually genuine ones,\" the CPA said in a statement. The secondary market was \"effectively being used as a premium price primary market for those fans who wish to use it for convenience\", it added. Those fans would be happier that a premium paid \"went to the artist via the promoter rather than went to a tout\", it said. The CPA said \"the real problem\" facing fans was that \"tickets that touts put onto the secondary market don't actually exist and those that do are not in their possession to sell on\". Earlier this month, Jon Webster, chief executive of the Music Managers Forum, called for a cap on resale values. He told the BBC: \"It reflects badly, at the end of the day, on the artists - probably more so than anyone. \"Punters don't know who the promoters are most of the time so, in the end, the fans blame the artist.\"", "output": "Secondary ticketing website Viagogo has defended the practice of gig promoters selling tickets on its website saying \"we don't discriminate\".", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "Naguib Sawiris, chairman of Orascom Telecom, Egypt's largest mobile phone network, told World Business News that the demonstrations would not stop until Egypt moved towards democracy.

From that point on maskirovka was a part of his life. All human history can be portrayed as the history of deception.\" Vladimirov quotes liberally from the Roman general Frontinus and the ancient Chinese philosopher Sun Tzu who described war as an eternal path of cunning. But it's Russia, he tells me, with unmistakable pride, that has over the centuries really honed these techniques to perfection. One of the most famous examples is the Battle of Kulikovo Field in 1380, when the young Muscovite, Prince Dmitry Donskoy, and 50,000 Russian warriors fought against 150,000 Tatar-Mongolian soldiers led by Khan Mamai. It was the first time the Slavs were fighting as a united army - Russia against the Golden Horde. \"The fighting was very tough, but we eventually triumphed thanks to one regiment hiding in the forest,\" says Vladimirov. \"They attacked ferociously and unexpectedly and the ambushed Tatars ran away.\" But that was just a start. Vladimirov reels off some more recent legendary battles in which Russia outfoxed its enemies, with flair and cunning. There was the Jassy-Kishinev operation of August 1944, which featured dozens of dummy tanks as well as whole Red Army divisions sent in false directions to throw the Germans off the scent. And that came just after Operation Bagration in Belorussia had dealt Hitler's troops a devastating blow. \"It was clear the military skill of Soviet leaders outclassed the Germans,\" Vladimirov says. \"Our generals decided not to go the easy way along the road but through the swamps! That way they attacked the rear of the German forces. That's mastery for you! All throughout Bagration, there were colossal examples of maskirovka involving thousands of tanks and troops. After that the war was practically over.\" Out of 117 divisions and six brigades, half were destroyed and the rest suffered 50% losses - half a million Germans died there. Surprise is a key ingredient in maskirovka and the clandestine forces which occupied Crimea last February certainly delivered that. Pyotr Shelomovskiy, a Russian photojournalist, was there as they arrived. He had rushed down to Crimea expecting tensions to arise after Ukraine's Russian-backed president, Viktor Yanukovych, fled the country - and on 24 February he watched local pro-Russian activists building a small barricade on the square outside parliament. \"They started brewing tea and distributing drinks. Some journalists, myself included, were allowed to take pictures,\" says Shelomovskiy, \"and that was it for the night.\" Or so he thought. But in the small hours, unmarked military trucks drove up filled with heavily armed men. \"They ordered those demonstrators to lie face down on the ground - until they realised they were on the same side,\" says Shelomovskiy. Then they made them carry ammunition into the parliament. He was told this story by the activists the next morning. \"They didn't really understand themselves what was going on,\" he says. The troops which had arrived in the dark, as if by magic, with no insignia on their olive-coloured uniforms, were soon nicknamed \"little green men\". \"We know now these guys were Russian special forces,\" says Shelomovskiy. \"But no-one said so at the time.\" Denial is another vital component in maskirovka. At a press conference a few days later Vladimir Putin coolly batted away awkward questions about where the troops came from. \"There are many military uniforms. Go into any shop and you can find one,\" he said. But were they Russian soldiers? Poker-faced, the president said the men were local self-defence units. Five weeks later, once the annexation had been rubber-stamped by the Parliament in Moscow, Putin admitted Russian troops had been deployed in Crimea after all. But the lie had served its purpose. Maskirovka is used to wrong-foot your enemies, to keep them guessing. Maj Gen Gordon 'Skip' Davis, in charge of operations and intelligence at Nato's military HQ in Belgium, admits it took him and his colleagues some time to figure out the \"size and the scale\" of the troop reinforcement which was \"continuously denied by the Russians\". But if Nato was taken by surprise, the historian and journalist Anne Applebaum was not. \"I knew immediately what it was because it reminded me of 1945. It looked so familiar,\" she says. \"With Crimea I got a bizarre sense of deja vu, because bringing in soldiers who weren't really soldiers - that was what the NKVD did in Poland after the war. They also created fake political entities which nobody had seen before, with fake ideologies already attached to them\u2026 It's a game of smoke and mirrors.\" After Crimea came the war in eastern Ukraine. Officially there are no Russian troops or little green men fighting there either - only patriotic volunteers who have gone to the region on holiday. But there is growing evidence of Moscow's intervention in the separatist conflict including a mounting toll of Russian soldiers killed in action. In August Russian TV showed footage of water and baby food being loaded on to lorries heading for Ukraine's war zone. The Russian government called this humanitarian aid but many were more than a little suspicious. Nato already had plenty of intelligence about Russian air defence and artillery forces moving into Ukraine. Maj Gen Davis calls the first convoy \"a wonderful example of maskirovka\" because it created something of a media storm. TV crews breathlessly followed the convoy, trying to find out what was really inside the green army trucks which had been hastily repainted white. Was this a classic Trojan horse operation to smuggle weapons to rebel militias? And would the Ukrainian authorities allow the convoy in? \"All the while at other border crossing points controlled by the Russians - not by the Ukrainians - equipment, personnel and troops were passing into Eastern Ukraine,\" says Davis. He sees the convoy as a clever \"diversion or distraction\". The fog of war isn't something which just happens - it's something which can be manufactured. In this case the Western media were bamboozled, but the compliant Russian media has also worked hard to generate fog. Ukrainian novelist Andrei Kurkov says he is constantly amazed by what he calls \"the fantasy and imagination of Russian journalists\". One of the most lurid stories broadcast on a Moscow TV channel claimed that a three-year-old boy in Sloviansk - a town in eastern Ukraine with a mostly Russian-speaking population - was crucified... for speaking Russian. The TV report is still online. A blonde woman, her voice choked with emotion, tells a serious-looking Russian news reporter that the three-year-old child was nailed to a wooden notice board in front of his mother and died in agony. The mother she alleges, was then tied to a tank and dragged through the streets until she died. She adds that she is risking her life by talking but wants to protect children against Ukrainian soldiers who behave like beasts and fascists. \"The lady claimed she'd witnessed this horrible story in Sloviansk,\" says Kurkov. \"But then she mentioned the name of the square where it happened and this square doesn't exist in Sloviansk. There's no such place.\" As Kurkov says, the story doesn't stand up. It emerged that the woman eyewitness had a history of filing false police reports and her own parents said they thought she'd given the interview for money. The elements of maskirovka TV and the digital world are awash with similar reports. A group of Kiev journalism students who set up a website to expose fake stories say some approaches are more sophisticated than this, mixing truth and falsehood to produce a report that appears credible. But even an incredible story may serve to confuse, and create uncertainty. Peter Pomerantsev, who recently spent several years working on documentaries and reality shows for Russian TV, argues that Russian state media are not just distorting truth in Ukraine, they go much further, promoting a seductive nihilism. \"The Russian strategy, both at home and abroad, is to say there is no such thing as truth,\" he says. \"I mean, you know, 'The Americans are bad, we're bad, and everyone's bad, so what's the big deal about us being a bit corrupt? You know our democracy's a sham, their democracy's a sham.' \"It's a sort of cynicism that actually resonates very powerfully in the West nowadays with this lack of self-confidence after the Iraq War, after the financial crash - and that's what the Russians are hoping for, just to take that cynicism and then use that in a military environment.\" Of course, every country uses strategies of deception. Churchill famously said: \"In wartime, truth is so precious she should always be accompanied by a bodyguard of lies.\" The Americans call such tactics CC&D - concealment, camouflage and deception. So what sets Russia apart? Maj Gen Skip Davis argues Western forces are sometimes economical with the truth but says they don't tell outright lies: \"We are talking about denial of information - in other words, not confirming facts - versus blatantly denying. Saying, 'No that's not us invading, that's not our forces there, that's someone else's.'\" But what about the false information that propelled Britain and the US into war with Iraq? Few would now deny that the facts on WMD were massaged in a maskirovka-type way. The word Davis keeps coming back to is \"mindset\". He insists maskirovka has become a modus operandi for Russia itself. \"I think that there is an alignment between what probably started out as military doctrine, but now is much more a part of state policy and there's an alignment between the strategic down to the tactical level in terms of the mindset of maskirovka.\" This perception is nothing new for Russia's neighbours. A decade ago Andrei Kurkov predicted recent events in Ukraine in his book, The President's Last Love. He writes in Russian and most of his books are on sale there but this one was stopped at the border. \"Putin is one of the main characters,\" he says. \"In this book he promises the Ukrainian president that he will annex Crimea and cut the gas supply and lots of other things that later became reality - this is the reason why the book is banned.\" Isn't it uncanny that he managed such accurate predictions? \"I don't think it was difficult - somehow when you live in a not very logical world, when the logic of absurdity prevails and the players don't evolve - it's actually quite simple.\" Maskirovka: Deception Russian Style was broadcast as part of the Analysis series on BBC Radio 4 - listen to the programme on BBC iPlayer or download the podcast.

Claim 1 \"The United States has done far more 'testing' than any other nation, by far!\" Mr Trump said this on 25 March, when the latest official data showed that a total of 418,810 people had been tested in the US. Figures from South Korea for that date show a total of 357,896 tests. Before that, South Korea had conducted more tests than anyone else. So the US has carried out more tests in total, but what's important is that South Korea has a population of about 51 million, compared with the US which has about 328 million. Therefore, by 25 March the US had tested around one in 780 people, compared with South Korea which had tested more than one out of every 150 people. That's far fewer per capita in the US than in South Korea, and both countries detected their first case of Covid-19 on the same day in late January. In early March, the White House conceded that the United States did not have enough testing kits and some health centres have also reported difficulties using them. However, testing in the US has significantly ramped up recently, with the total number almost doubling in late March. Claim 2 When asked about WHO data on the virus's death rate: \"I think the 3.4% is really a false number... Personally, I think the number is way under 1%.\" In a telephone interview on Fox News, President Trump said a WHO figure of 3.4% for the coronavirus death rate was \"false\". The WHO reported this figure on 3 March and said it was based on all the confirmed coronavirus cases that had resulted in death. Mr Trump said he thought the true death rate, based on \"my hunch\", was \"way under 1%\". He said the death rate appeared higher because many people who caught a mild form of the virus did not report it to the doctor and therefore did not end up as confirmed cases. At the moment we don't know how likely you are to die from coronavirus, mainly because of the lack of data on infections. However, scientists' current best guess is about 1%. Claim 3 On 9 March: \"Last year 37,000 Americans died from the common flu. Nothing is shut down, life and the economy go on... Think about that.\" This statement from the president requires context. We don't know exactly how many American deaths there have been linked to flu. But estimates from the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) give a range between 26,339 and 52,664 flu deaths last winter (between October 2019 and February 2020), with a best estimate of 34,157. So a lot of people die from flu each year, as Mr Trump points out. However, unlike most strains of flu, the spread of the new coronavirus has not yet been contained by vaccines or immunity from previous outbreaks, and scientists (including those from the WHO) believe it has a significantly higher death rate than that of seasonal flu (which, on average, is about 0.1%). Claim 4 On 7 March: \"Very soon, we're going to come up [with a vaccine].\" Currently there is no vaccine for this new coronavirus, although scientists in many countries are working hard to develop one. Scientists say realistically, one won't be ready until at least the middle of next year. Testing of vaccines on animals has already started. There's also been a test on human volunteers of a vaccine against coronavirus, but it will take many months before we know if this works. Claim 5 On 29 February: \"We've taken the most aggressive actions to confront the coronavirus. They are the most aggressive taken by any country.\" The US has now imposed sweeping restrictions and some quarantine measures. But other countries have also taken aggressive measures to counter the virus - in some instances, more than the US.

Organisers said \"challenging ground conditions\" had been compounded by \"people not following directions\", causing tailbacks on local roads. However, they said the event had had a \"great first year\" at Strathallan. There were 54 arrests during the four days the festival's campsites were open, on a par with figures from the previous year, and a 36-year-old man was found dead in the toilets on Saturday. The suitability of the local road network for the high volume of festival traffic was one of the issues raised during a planning battle over the choice of Strathallan following the event's move across Perthshire from Balado. After lengthy delays which saw some fans unable to leave the site until 02:00 on the first night of the festival on Friday, bosses apologised and said they would \"review the situation\". Event manager Colin Rodger said approximately 500 people had attempted to walk three miles back to an unofficial campsite \"in an unsuitable location\", restricting access to pick-up points. After a second night of long queues and delays on Saturday, festival director Geoff Ellis said his team were \"working hard\" to rectify delays. Wet conditions left many vehicles needing to be towed from one car park, and Mr Ellis said the current team \"don't have the benefit of 18 years of infrastructure that we did at Balado\". He also hit out at a \"high volume of people\" attempting to walk from the site, causing tailbacks. A further statement was released on Monday as queues again formed, reading: \"Due to challenging ground conditions, there have been a number of vehicles in ditches this morning and this compounded with people not following directions and going to the wrong exists which has resulted in these delays.\" Scottish Conservative MSP Liz Smith said it was \"not unexpected\" that there had been delays on the \"narrow country roads\". She said: \"It is very clear that a large number of people who attended the event were very frustrated by what they encountered when they were trying to enter and leave. This led to significant numbers of people walking along dangerous roads. \"There has to be a major review of what happened this year.\" 'Great year' Mr Ellis admitted the event had \"not been perfect\", but said it had been a \"great first year\" overall. He said: \"We know traffic queues have left some people frustrated and we apologise for this, because obviously we want the experience to be positive for everyone from start to finish. \"We'll take learnings from this year and will work on improving the times for the future. \"Overall it's been a great first year at Strathallan - the bands were brilliant, the site looked wonderful and we know that the majority of people have had a fantastic time.\" Another concern raised in advance of the festival was for the well-being of a pair of ospreys nesting near the site, but RSPB Scotland said the event had gone off without disturbing the protected birds. A spokesman said the birds had been \"closely monitored\", and that they had stayed in place behaving normally throughout. Supt Colin Brown of Police Scotland thanked festival-goers for \"behaving responsibly\", saying that while some of the 54 arrests had been for \"more serious offences\", the majority of them had been detected or had positive lines of inquiry. More than 200 acts played across the weekend, with headline performers including The Libertines, Avicii, Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds and Kasabian well received by the crowds.

As many as 800 migrants are feared drowned after the boat they were travelling in capsized in Libyan waters south of the Italian island of Lampedusa on Sunday. The IOM believes the number of migrants dying in Mediterranean Sea crossings could hit 30,000 this year if the current rate continues. Federico Soda, IOM's Italy director, said the Italian maritime forces were doing \"incredible work\" trying to rescue as many people as possible, but that the rising number of deaths was \"unacceptable\". \"Search and rescue efforts must be more comprehensive and supported by the European Union and its member states. This is a humanitarian emergency that involves us all and responses to it must be more holistic.\" Perilous journeys By far the largest number of migrant deaths internationally have taken place in the Mediterranean, according to the IOM. The figures are striking. Not including Sunday's sinking, nearly eight out of every 10 deaths have taken place there this year. By comparison, the second highest number of migrants died in the Horn of Africa where fewer than one in 10 deaths occurred. Of those migrants who die in the Mediterranean, the vast majority of them began their journey in Sub-Saharan Africa. Most dangerous routes Within the Mediterranean, the Central migration route from North Africa to Italy and Malta is the deadliest. So far this year, 910 people have been killed as a result of attempting the journey. The 800 potential victims of Sunday's sinking are also likely to join their number. A much smaller number of migrants died travelling along the Mediterranean's other routes - to its east and west and towards Apulia and Calabria, Italy. Last year, a total of 3,279 migrants were killed as a result of their journey across the sea to Europe. Again, by far the majority died along the Central Mediterranean route. Death rate Some 912 out of 954 of this year's deaths have been on routes towards Italy, as of 17 April. The IOM estimates that 21,191 migrants have reached the Italian coasts alive during the same period. This makes the rate of death en route to Italy so far this year 4.13 per 100 people. By comparison, some 26,644 migrants had made it alive to Italy by 30 April last year - an increase of 5,000 more than this year - according to data provided by the Italian Ministry of Interior. Who are the victims? Looking back to 2014 as a whole, the African nations with the most migrants reaching Italy were Eritrea, Mali and Nigeria.

Icann will begin taking applications next year, with corporations and cities expected to be among the first. \"Icann has opened the internet's addressing system to the limitless possibilities of the human imagination,\" said Rod Beckstrom, president and chief executive officer for Icann. \"No one can predict where this historic decision will take us.\" There will be several hundred new generic top-level domain names (gTLDs), which could include such addresses as .google, .coke, or even .BBC. There are currently 22 gTLDs, as well as about 250 country-level domain names such as .uk or .de. Costly process It will cost $185,000 (\u00a3114,000) to apply for the suffixes, and companies would need to show they have a legitimate claim to the name they are buying. Analysts say it is a price that global giants might be willing to pay - in order to maximise their internet presence. The money will be used to cover costs incurred by Icann in developing the new gTLDs and employing experts to scrutinise the many thousands of expected applications. A portion will be set-aside to deal with potential legal actions, raised by parties who fail to get the domains they want. The vote completes a six-year negotiation process and is the biggest change to the system since .com was first introduced 26 years ago. Icann said it was beginning a global communications programme to raise awareness of the new domain names. Applications will start on 12 January. High standards Companies and organisations seeking one of the new gTLDs will have to meet high technical standards, according to Bruce Tonkin, chief strategy officer at Melbourne IT, a domain registry service. \"You need IT robustness and you need intellectual property protections beyond what is available in the dot com space. \"You have to have 24/7 abuse team. You have to have mechanisms where a trademark holder has first right to get their name,\" he said.

Mr Marshall said he is \"astonished\" at the failure to nominate any member of the unionist community to the Republic of Ireland's upper chamber. The Irish government has been asked for a response to Mr Marshall's criticism. The 11 extra seats were filled by nominations on Saturday. They were taken by representatives from the three new parties of government Fianna F\u00e1il, Fine Gael and the Green Party, as well as Eileen Flynn, a Travellers' rights activist. \"This a huge missed opportunity and sends a very clear message to the unionist community that they have no role play down south,\" said Mr Marshall. \"How can you have a shared island if you only talk to yourself? \"The three party leaders all talked about change and renewal and yet they turn their backs on unionists and any talk of a shared island is just a farce.\" Fianna F\u00e1il leader Miche\u00e1l Martin was elected taoiseach (Irish prime minister) on Saturday. He now leads a three-party coalition government consisting of Fianna F\u00e1il, Fine Gael and the Green Party. Mr Marshall served two years in the Seanad after being nominated by the former Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar. He sat as an independent and received support from Sinn F\u00e9in in his first election but he lost his seat in the election earlier this year. \"This is not about me,\" he said. \"For two years I was there representing the unionist voices, trying to build bridges at a time when relations were strained because of Brexit. \"I had hoped the parties would have recognised the real need to have that voice in the chamber but sadly not. \"In fact, there were no nominations from Northern Ireland which is a real backward step at a time of great political flux. \"For all their faults, at least the parties at Stormont are trying to make progress but it seem that is not the case when it comes to politicians in the Republic where they are happy to pay lip service to a shared island. \"I am very worried about the message that this sends out to the unionist community.\" It is not just unionists who have criticised the taoiseach's selection - several people from Northern Ireland have pointed out that there are no nominees from that side of the Irish border. Sinn F\u00e9in Senator Niall \u00d3 Donnghaile, from Belfast, expressed his \"disappointment and frustration\" on Twitter over the lack of northern representation. \"So much for \"the Republican Party\", so much for \"the United Ireland party\" and so much for the Greens actually supposed to be an all-Ireland party!\" he tweeted.

But he added it was difficult to make Teslas with their new and developing technology as cheaply as conventional cars, and the firm's cars were still \"too expensive for most people\". Tesla employs more than 45,000 people, indicating it will cut about 3,000. Shares in the car manufacturer opened more than 6% lower as trading began in the US on Friday. Mr Musk said 2018 was Tesla's \"most successful\" yet, in which it delivered almost as many cars as it had in all the previous years of its existence combined. However, while it ramped up production of its mid-market Model 3 car, Mr Musk said its products were too pricey for the average driver and its profits too low. \"This quarter will hopefully allow us, with great difficulty, effort and some luck, to target a tiny profit,\" he wrote. \"However, starting around May, we will need to deliver at least the mid-range Model 3 variant in all markets, as we need to reach more customers who can afford our vehicles. \"Moreover, we need to continue making progress towards lower priced variants of Model 3.\" He said Tesla had \"no choice\" but to reduce full-time employee headcount and retain \"only the most critical temps and contractors\". He added the firm would need to make these cuts while \"increasing the Model 3 production rate\" and making many \"manufacturing engineering improvements in the coming months\". It's been a tough few years for the electric carmaker and its high-profile founder. The firm has repeatedly failed to meet its own production targets, leading many investors to bet against it. Analysis: Theo Leggett, business correspondent Tesla is in a race against time. It's already well established as a niche producer of upmarket electric vehicles. But that isn't where the company sees its future. Electric cars at the moment are in many ways a lifestyle choice. But in future, ever tighter emissions regulations and restrictions on \"regular\" cars are expected to drive them into the mainstream. It's potentially a huge market - and Tesla is targeting a significant share. That's the rationale behind its brand new Model 3, billed as an \"affordable\" electric car. But the Model 3 isn't actually that affordable yet - the cheapest versions have yet to go on sale. And it needs to make a lot more of them, in order to benefit from economies of scale. Meanwhile established manufacturers will soon be flooding the market with brand new EVs of their own. Last year the priority for Tesla was simply to boost production as quickly as possible, to meet ambitious targets. It took on a lot of new employees to make that happen. Now, it needs to make even more cars, more cheaply - and it will have to do so with fewer staff. That certainly won't be easy, but according to Elon Musk, \"there isn't any other way\". Mr Musk was also caught up in a number of scandals, including being sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission after tweeting that he planned to take Tesla private. Some analysts have speculated that Tesla will turn the ship around this year, but earlier this month it fell short on quarterly deliveries of the Model 3. It also had to cut prices in the US to offset lower green tax credits. In his email, Mr Musk noted the firm was cutting the jobs after expanding its headcount by almost a third in 2018. \"Tesla has only been producing cars for about a decade and we're up against massive, entrenched competitors,\" he said. \"The net effect is that Tesla must work much harder than other manufacturers to survive while building affordable, sustainable products.\"", "output": "Electric carmaker Tesla has said it will cut its workforce by 7% after the \"most challenging\" year in its history.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "ScotRail said a signalling fault at Perth affected 12 services to Aberdeen and Inverness from Glasgow and Edinburgh.

Reporting the threat, the French magistrates' union appealed for calm. Mr Sarkozy denies receiving illegal donations from L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt in 2007. The former conservative president has been placed under formal investigation, accused of accepting thousands of euros from the 90-year-old widow, the country's wealthiest woman, whom experts consider to have been in a state of dementia since at least 2006. On Monday, Mr Sarkozy went public for the first time about the investigation, saying he had never betrayed his public duties and pledging to clear his name. \"I will devote all of my energy to prove my probity and honesty,\" he wrote on Facebook. \"The truth will prevail eventually. I have no doubt about it.\" Mr Sarkozy won the presidential election of 2007 comfortably, only to be defeated last year by Socialist candidate Francois Hollande. 'Intolerable escalation' Mr Gentil is the most prominent of the three judges conducting the investigation. The magistrates' union said the threat had come on Wednesday after \"unworthy if not insulting remarks by certain politicians following the placing under investigation of Nicolas Sarkozy and questioning of the impartiality of one of the magistrates (Mr Gentil)\" by Mr Sarkozy's lawyer, Thierry Herzog. \"Today this magistrate was sent a letter to which blank cartridges were attached, clearly making a threat of death to him, those close to him and members of the magistrates' union,\" the union said on its website. Rejecting attempts to \"discredit\" magistrates, it said: \"Everyone should demonstrate the utmost responsibility in their words and we firmly condemn this intolerable escalation of violence.\" Mr Herzog questioned Judge Gentil's impartiality in an interview with Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche. The judge was among those who signed an opinion column in Le Monde newspaper in June accusing Mr Sarkozy and his predecessor Jacques Chirac of \"wishing to protect the corrupt\", Mr Herzog pointed out. \"Five days after signing this column, the same judge ordered four raids on Sarkozy's home, his office and his secretary's house,\" the lawyer said. Judge Gentil unexpectedly summoned Mr Sarkozy for a face-to-face encounter with Mrs Bettencourt's butler, Pascal Bonnefoy, in Bordeaux last week. The judge wanted to determine how often the politician had met Mrs Bettencourt in 2007. While Mr Sarkozy has maintained he only saw her once during that year, the butler gave a different account.

Niger and other countries in the Sahel have been facing a growing militant threat from several Islamist groups. The Islamic State group has said it was behind the ambush but there has been no confirmation of this claim by the authorities. Militants belonging to affiliates of al-Qaeda are also active in the region. They are most active in neighbouring Mali, where French troops intervened in 2013 to prevent them from advancing on the capital, but they often stage cross-border raids. How did the attack happen? The soldiers were in pursuit of militants who attacked a high security prison 50km (30 miles) on Tuesday outside the capital, Niamey, a government spokesman told the BBC. \"One of the soldiers' vehicles drove into a landmine and then the assailants started firing at our soldiers,\" Mr Zakariyyah told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme on Tuesday. It was initially reported that 17 soldiers had been killed in the ambush. Without providing any evidence, the Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the attack via its news agency Amaq. According to the statement, 40 were killed and injured, although for now the government has said that the death toll was 28. Mr Zakariyyah did not identify the perpetrators of the attack but said it happened near where US troops and five Niger soldiers were killed two years ago. A search operation, aided by French and American troops, who have a base in Niger, continues. Niger is part of a five nation anti-insurgency force operating in the Sahel. It includes Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali and Mauritania. The G5 Sahel, as it is called, is backed by a 3,000-strong French force. Call to attack French allies By Louise Dewast, BBC West Africa correspondent This was the deadliest attack recorded in western Niger, where government troops and their international allies are fighting affiliates of al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group. Authorities say it was a complex attack in which the militants planted improvised explosive devices. Despite years of heavy deployments of French, US and UN forces, the region - including Niger - remains a tinderbox. The group called the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS), which has claimed responsibility for the attack, has recently been subject to counter-militancy operations, mainly led by the French, making large-scale attacks against government troops difficult. For one expert on the region, H\u00e9ni Nsaibia, a researcher at The Armed Conflict Location and Event Data group, this attack could be the result of French forces shifting its focus to central Mali, and to the recent hostage-release operation in Burkina Faso which required attention and assets. He adds it could also be that militants are heeding the call of Islamic State group leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who in a recent audiovisual speech explicitly called on them to intensify attacks against France and its allies in the Sahel region. The statement released on Thursday was issued by the central Islamic State but is being attributed to its affiliate in the region.

The average cost of a funeral has increased by 87% since the survey was first conducted in 2004. SunLife described a 39% jump in estate administration fees as a \"significant\" factor in this year's increase. The figures are set out in SunLife Direct's annual Cost of Dying report, which said that hiring a professional such as a solicitor now accounts for more than a third of expenditure associated with a person's death. The report found that saving money was a key motivation for the increased number of people who choose to manage their loved ones' affairs without professional help. 'Complex process' Responding to the survey's findings, a Law Society spokesperson said that enlisting a solicitor \"may save time and money in the future by ensuring things are done right the first time\". Another factor influencing how much people spent was the type of funeral, since cremation tends to be less expensive than burial. The average burial cost is now \u00a33,982, a rise of 2% since last year and 89% since the survey began in 2004. Dr Kate Woodthorpe, a sociologist from the University of Bath and author of the SunLife report, said the costs of funerals were rising \"on numerous fronts\". Funeral directors' fees reflect the costs of \"staff salaries, the expense of running a business, but also the costs recovered by local authorities\", she explained. \"Local authorities are trying to preserve land by removing subsidies for burial, and in the case of cremation trying to recover the costs of meeting mercury emissions targets,\" she said. 'Funding slashed' A spokesman for the Local Government Association responded that local government funding had been \"slashed\" over the past three years which meant \"councils have been forced to examine all their services carefully\". \"Where services have been subsidised by council tax payers previously, as has been the case with some cemeteries and crematoriums, councils have had no choice but to review the fees they charge,\" the spokesman said. Cost also varied widely across different regions. The average funeral cost in the London area was \u00a310,498, compared with \u00a35,893 in Northern Ireland. The cost of a funeral will not always be met by families. When a person dies without relatives or the relatives are unable to pay, local councils or the NHS can provide a public health funeral. Dr Woodthorpe argued that \"we don't have a culture of talking about death, which means we often don't plan properly, and we need to address that\".", "output": "The \"cost of dying\" is more than 10% higher than it was this time last year, according to a report.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "Mike Coupe said supermarkets were \"over the hump\" of inflation driven by the fall in the value of the pound. He made the prediction as Sainsbury's reported rising food sales in the last three months, including over Christmas. The UK's second largest supermarket chain said grocery sales rose 2.3%, helped by higher food prices. Food prices have gone up, as the drop in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote made imports more expensive. \"We've done everything we can as a business to mitigate that but we can't get away from the fact that food prices are going up,\" Mr Coupe told the BBC. But with that effect wearing off, food price inflation should \"gradually reduce over the next six to nine months\", he said. Christmas shopping Sainsbury's, which also owns Argos, sold 1.1% more in the last three months, as higher grocery sales made up for a 1.4% fall in general merchandise and slower clothing sales. Argos's Fast Track delivery and collection grew strongly over the period, but that was not enough to stop a slide in Argos's sales. \"The general merchandise that Argos sells may be a millstone around the group's neck right now, but longer term the appeal of combining Christmas grocery and gift shopping in one location is clear to see,\" said Laith Khalaf, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

But when Wycombe Abbey, a girls' boarding school in Buckinghamshire, opens its doors in China in September, it will be not be launching a replica. Wycombe Abbey International in Changzhou near Shanghai will be co-educational, and will teach a hybrid of the Chinese and English curriculums within an English-style boarding school environment. Alongside international GCSEs and A-levels, pupils will follow a Chinese curriculum in mathematics. And it won't be serving international students or UK families in China. Around 90% of the students will be local Chinese. \"We're catering to the insatiable demand in China for an English-medium education,\" said Wycombe Abbey's headmistress Rhiannon Wilkinson, who has also taught in Hong Kong and Brunei. \"But we are also responding to a need for an English-style education system and Chinese methods,\" she said. \"They don't want to be westernised but they want to apply to western universities.\" International schools were once a virtual foreign enclave within the host country, a preserve of internationally-mobile expatriate families working for multinational companies. Now more local families are using international schools, where they study A-levels and International Baccalaureates from the UK and Advanced Placement programmes from the US, as a springboard to getting places in UK and US universities. Some parents also want their children to rub shoulders with an international elite and build contacts for a future career. More stories from the BBC's Knowledge economy series looking at education from a global perspective and how to get in touch Another motivation is to escape the relentless drudgery and ferocious competition of a local school system based on rote learning and geared only towards exams. \"Families are worried about the pressure of the system on their children,\" said Ms Wilkinson. There are now about 8,000 international schools around the world, teaching 4.26 million students, according to research by the International School Consultancy. Nowhere has growth been faster than in Asia. From less than a dozen such schools in each country a decade or so ago, Thailand now has over 172 international curriculum schools, half of them following England's national curriculum. Malaysia has 142, Japan 233, and Singapore - which makes it difficult for foreigners to enrol in local schools - around 63. Myanmar could also become a hotspot - Dulwich College will open there next year. Hong Kong which had 92 such schools in 2000 now has 171. Demand, particularly from local wealthy families is such that virtually all the leading international schools in Hong Kong have waiting lists, says ISC director Richard Gaskell, who is based in Bangkok. Only South Korea has seen a retraction, with some international schools struggling to fill places. But the big story is China. From a dozen schools 15 years ago, China has some 530 English-medium international schools, catering for 326,000 students. According to ISC Research, between 2010 and 2014 the number of international curriculum schools in Shanghai alone increased almost 40%, currently educating over 71,000 pupils. From a concentration in Beijing and Shanghai which together account for half the international schools in China, schools are spreading to other cities. Malvern College is in Qingdao and Chengdu. Dulwich College has expanded from its flagship schools in Shanghai and Beijing, to Suzhou and Zhuhai. Wellington has set up in Tianjin. \"A local authority such as Jiangsu province knows that if they put in a top brand school like Wycombe Abbey, they can attract more people into the area,\" said William Vanbergen, chief executive of BE Education, an education consultancy which brokered Wycombe Abbey's entry into China. There are less than a million foreigners in China. \"But the market size for the local, growing, middle-class Chinese is huge,\" said Mr Vanbergen, based in Shanghai. \"China loves brand names,\" said Mr Vanbergen. But these schools also boast fantastic sporting and other facilities unheard of in local schools, which are more focused on exams. He estimates there are \"100 UK schools looking to go into China.\" Dulwich College International with six schools in China, runs two types of school. It has four international schools which can only admit foreign nationals. But its two joint-venture high schools operated with a Chinese partner school in Suzhou and Zhuhai predominantly admit locals. Both types of school teach IGCSE and A-levels. The Chinese authorities keep strict controls on younger children studying an overseas curriculum. \"They do not want children getting a wrong view of history, and they are quite paranoid about the humanities,\" said ISC's Mr Gaskell, who believes these restrictions will continue. But the authorities are more relaxed about over-15 year olds following a foreign curriculum. It allows these students to improve their chances of getting into top overseas universities and it helps to attract prestigious schools. At the same time they are reining in so-called \"international streams\" in local schools which have burgeoned in recent years with variable quality. \"In China the need to get into top 100 universities is more intense than even 10 years ago and an international school is seen as a secure track for a very good education,\" said Laurence Cook of Dulwich College International (DCI) in Shanghai. \"The British boarding schools that have set up in China and elsewhere in Asia have an extremely high placement rate and are respected for being very well run.\" China's new wealthy are also looking at international schools for a different kind of education. Campbell Douglas, head of Dulwich in Zhuhai, a boarding school close to Hong Kong and Macau, says parents want something more than preparing for the competitive national college entrance, the \"gaokao\". \"There is a slow awakening in China that the gaokao does not allow for any other development of the child beyond the academic,\" said Mr Douglas. But it is often a leap of faith, requiring an early decision to abandon the local system, often with no easy way to return if they change their minds. And while parents want English immersion, they want to retain their own culture. \"Chinese parents want the best of both worlds, but fundamentally that their children remain Chinese,\" said Mr Vanbergen. It is creating a new hybrid trend, mixing eastern and western. Dulwich Colleges in China and in Singapore are teaching in English and Mandarin, responding to the demands not just of local families, but from families in other Asian countries such as Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia. Wellington College says that its new outpost in Shanghai will teach a dual-language curriculum. Mr Cook, from Dulwich College International, said parents realise that the future is going to be increasingly global, and if they are going to succeed \"their children are going to have to cope with English and they can do that without sending them overseas\".", "output": "Another top boarding school in England is setting up a school in China, travelling the path taken by schools such as Harrow, Dulwich College, Malvern and Wellington.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "Prime Minister Borut Pahor's centre-left coalition was defeated amid opposition accusations of corruption and economic mismanagement.

A current bishop said it would be \"too much of a headache\" to appoint him, he claimed. The Church in Wales \"strongly denied\" the accusations of homophobia. Dr John said he had been told appointing him would be difficult because he was in a civil partnership, although celibate in line with Church teaching. 'Unsettling publicity' He wrote to the Bishop of Swansea and Brecon - the Right Reverend John Davies, who is currently the Church's senior bishop - after an electoral college of bishops, clergy and lay people failed to reach a decision about who should replace Dr Barry Morgan as bishop. It is understood Dr John received a majority of the votes, but not the two-thirds required by Church rules. He said homophobic remarks had been made at the electoral college meeting. \"Much more importantly, the only arguments adduced against my appointment - in particular by two of the bishops - were directly related to my homosexuality and/or civil partnership - namely that my appointment would bring unwelcome and unsettling publicity to the diocese,\" he wrote. Dr John said he had been told by a bishop by telephone they were \"'just too exhausted' to deal with the problems they believed [his] appointment would cause.\" \"I put it to you that this is not a moral or legal basis on which to exclude me,\" Dr John wrote. Under the Church's rules, the decision has passed to its bench of bishops, who failed to reach a decision when they met last week. A Church in Wales spokeswoman told BBC News: \"At the recent meeting of Electoral College no one candidate secured the necessary two-thirds majority to be elected Bishop of Llandaff. The appointment will now be made by the Church's bishops. \"After a process of consultation, they have drawn up a shortlist of names which is confidential. However, the Bishops strongly deny allegations of homophobia.\" Dr John, who was born in Tonyrefail in Rhondda Cynon Taff, was nominated as Bishop of Reading in 2003, but was asked to withdraw from the role by the then-Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams. He entered a civil partnership with Grant Holmes in 2006, but said at the time he had remained celibate, in line with Church teaching. He is a public supporter of same-sex marriage, writing in the Church Times in 2012 that \"theologically, ethically, and sacramentally, there is no difference between a gay couple and a heterosexual couple who cannot have children\". \"So, yes, same-sex marriage can be as holy and sacramental as heterosexual marriage. Yes, God is in favour of gay marriage and so should the Church be,\" he added. Gay rights campaigners have previously called for him to be made a bishop in Wales. Dr John's nomination as Bishop of Reading caused controversy in 2003 when Dr Williams summoned him to Lambeth Palace and asked him to withdraw from the post. Some conservative Anglican leaders had warned they would split from the communion if Dr John's consecration went ahead. Friends of Dr John told the BBC last year that he had \"painted the house, finished the episcopal training sessions, and been given the keys of the official car when the job was taken away\".", "output": "A gay clergyman has accused the Anglican Church in Wales of homophobia after he was rejected for a job as a bishop.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "By Tim MastersEntertainment correspondent, BBC News The classic Stones LP was named reissue of the year at the Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards in London on Wednesday.

There's no point to these awards if you were actually on it.' \"But I have played these songs for the last 30 years and it's about time that I collected,\" he added. \"So thanks a lot!\" Wood joined the Rolling Stones in 1975, three years after the release of Exile on Main Street. The reissued album was a UK number one in May, giving the Stones their first chart-topper in 16 years. Prior to this, their last number one album was Voodoo Lounge in 1994. AC/DC's Brian Johnson sent a video message from Australia for the group's band of the year accolade \"We never take any of this for granted,\" he told the audience. \"Have a drink on us.\" Guitarist Slash said his award for his eponymous solo album was \"a huge honour\". His debut collection features guest vocalists, among them Ozzy Osbourne, Lemmy from Motorhead and Fergie from Black Eyed Peas. Elsewhere tributes were paid to the late heavy metal singer Ronnie James Dio, who died in May at the age of 67. His widow Wendy collected the Tommy Vance inspiration award for the former Rainbow and Black Sabbath vocalist.

Other recent arts sponsorship controversies Analysis by Will Gompertz, BBC arts editor Life has never been easy for arts fundraisers. Typically sport takes the lion's share of corporate sponsorship, with arts organisations feeding off any scraps of company cash that might be left over. There is not a history of companies queuing around the block to financially support exhibitions and gallery refurbishments. It is a small pool in which fundraisers have to fish, and it's now in danger of evaporating altogether. The public scrutiny museums, theatres, orchestras and other arts bodies now find themselves under is unprecedented. The effect is two-fold. Firstly, corporate sponsorship deals nowadays must be able to withstand forensic examination by stakeholders and the media, which Turner Contemporary's deal with Stagecoach could not. Secondly, the negativity surrounding arts sponsorship - from the Sackler Trust controversy to BAE Systems withdrawal from supporting the Great Exhibition of the North - is extremely off-putting for companies that might be thinking of entering the arts arena. What has also become absolutely clear over the past 12 months is that arts organisations have to up their game when it comes to basic due diligence before accepting a sponsor's money. It is no longer good enough to check the credentials of the sponsoring company. They now have to make sure the personal values of those who run and own it are compatible with their own charitable objectives. A quick Google search won't do. Twitter feeds, Instagram posts and other platforms for public comment all have to be rigorously checked. All of which means more work for already hard-pressed fundraising departments operating in arts institutions that are still feeling the chill wind of austerity. Theirs is a difficult and thankless job that has now become much, much harder. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

But for young people with learning disabilities and their parents, it can be a time of stress, sadness and anxiety. A new BBC documentary, Special Me, looks into the world of young teenagers with a disability as they close the school door behind them forever. The programme introduces us to Gareth Knox whose life is about to change beyond recognition. He has Down's Syndrome and autism and attends Kilronan school in Magherafelt. When he turns 18, he will move from child to adult services. This will automatically trigger a change in health and social care arrangements including new social workers, new respite arrangements and a fundamental alteration of routine. All that change can be traumatic. His mother Claire speaks about the dreams and hopes she had for her new born son. She knew his life was going to be more difficult than most, but they were as proud and as happy as any new parents could be. \"In my head, Gareth was going to be the first Down's Syndrome prime minister, you know, he was going to be the best thing ever,\" she said. \"We began filming with Gareth seven weeks before he reached his milestone 18th birthday and followed his journey as he made the transition from child to adult services,\" said documentary director Eimhear O'Neill. \"Reaching 18 was a poignant moment for the family who were delighted to see their son come of age, but they were also fearful of this move as it meant his respite arrangements, a life saver for the family, changed,\" she said. \"Gareth has not had an overnight stay since leaving children's services in July though his family are hopeful that some overnight respite under adult services may begin later this month.\" The film also follows Phoebe Dalrymple, 19, on her last week at school. We meet her at the school leavers' party which is a highly moving experience, both for the students, staff and parents. Over the course of the documentary, we rejoin her as she begins part of her next chapter at Alternative Angles in Ballymena - a scheme that teaches new skills to adults with learning difficulties. David Skelly, 32, who has Down's Syndrome, also features. Since he left school 13 years ago, he has worked in both paid and voluntary employment. David is very proud of what he has achieved since leaving school. We join him as he volunteers at The Avenue, a cafe run by Stepping Stones in Lisburn. The charity gives adults with learning disabilities the opportunity to take part in accredited training and gain skills for employment. For director Eimhear, this subject was very close to her heart. \"When I was growing up, I was surrounded by the special needs community in Magherafelt as my mum worked at the local special school,\" she said. \"Every summer, I volunteered in their summer scheme and I was introduced to an incredibly loving, thoughtful and vibrant community. At the end of each academic year, I would ask my mum: 'Who is leaving this year and what will they do when they leave?'\" she said. \"I felt it was very important to invite viewers into the lives of these three very special people and also to the lives of the many individuals with special needs featured in the documentary. \"Like everyone they are confident, scared, hopeful, nervous, funny and brave.

Although no official figures exist, Dr Cox said there could be up to 100,000 au pairs in the UK, with about 75% based in London and the South East. She said the system had become a \"free-for-all\" since 2008. Home Office legislation that required non-EU au pairs to have visas meant all such workers used to have more protection, Dr Cox said. But now no visa system exists, she said no-one was taking responsibility for au pairs' safety. The government has defended its position, describing the \"au pair programme\" as a chance for people to \"experience cultures abroad while carrying out childcare or light domestic work\". Most au pairs in the UK are from Europe and tend to find families through agencies or on websites - but there is no regulation in place to police the system, and some au pairs allege they have been mistreated and overworked by their host families. \"By accident, by deleting the visa, they created this non-regulation of au pairs. It was an oversight,\" Dr Cox said. She said that under the current set-up, both au pairs and their employers were at risk because neither were required to have background checks. \"You could be on the sex offenders register and you'd still be allowed to host an au pair in your house,\" the academic said. Dr Cox believes the authorities need to create a clear definition of what an au pair is and set up regulations for au pair agencies. \"They need to take responsibility for the situation they've created,\" she said. 'I felt really uncomfortable and unsafe' Ellie (not her real name) had her first experience of au pairing in the UK came when she worked for a family in south-east England. She says she found herself in a home where \"the kids were violent because they saw their mother be violent with their father\". Ellie said: \"I felt really uncomfortable and unsafe... the mother was screaming all the time.\" She said she was given tasks far beyond an au pair's duties and also had to work weekends, despite being told she would have them off. Ellie said she was supposed to work 30 to 40 hours a week but in fact did 70 hours each week, starting at 6am and finishing at 8 or 9pm. She added: \"When you are an au pair you want the family to welcome you as a part of the family, not just a domestic slave.\" 'She scared me so much' Isabella (not her real name) said she also had a \"really bad\" first experience of au pairing in the UK. She moved into a home in London where she carried out work such as cleaning and looking after the family's children. \"The mother said 'you are part of the family, don't worry'... but after two weeks they say 'I pay you too much, you don't do anything,'\" she said. Isabella said she found herself working more than 12 hours a day and also at weekends, but found little sympathy from the mother when she was struggling. \"She told me, 'I'm a mum I understand you, you want to speak with your mum, but you can't when you work for me'. \"She scared me so much... after two weeks, I escaped from this family and I went into a hostel.\" 'They are always asking me for cuddles' Of course not all au pairs have bad experiences. Anna Souto, 25, found her family on a website and came over from Spain in September after a series of chats with them online. \"From the first minute I arrived [in London] I felt like a member of the family... they are really nice with me.\" Anna added that she is given plenty of free time. She said: \"They are such lovely kids so for me it's really easy to be with them. \"They are always asking me for cuddles.\" 'They're so vulnerable' Maggie Dyer runs an agency that places au pairs with families. She believes many young women do not not realise the risks of going to live with a family they have never met. \"They're on their own when they come over here. They're so vulnerable,\" she said. \"I know of a girl who came over thinking she was going to be in London for a couple with some kids and a guy picked her up from the airport, took her right out into the country. \"There was no woman around, just him and the kids... she was totally isolated.\" Ms Dyer said many candidates contact her to find a new family after finding themselves in difficult situations. \"Some of them are working all hours. They get completely bullied by families. \"I know someone who was locked in, and wasn't let her out for her language course.\" Government guidance on au pairing in the UK: A spokesman from the Department for Business said: \"The au pair programme is an international scheme offering people the chance to live and experience cultures abroad while carrying out childcare or light domestic work.\" He added: \"If an au pair is a victim of modern slavery, which includes forced or compulsory work, slavery, servitude and human trafficking, this should be reported to the police immediately.\"", "output": "A leading expert on the employment of au pairs in the UK has described the way in which they are recruited as \"like the Wild West\".", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text.", "input": "The service has helped more than 2,600 school children as part of its Young First Aider Scheme.

Governments whose citizens abroad have been unlucky to be caught up are weighing up the dilemmas of repatriation and isolating those who may be carriers of the virus once home. Some countries have closed their borders to Chinese nationals altogether. And, in some quarters, there has - perhaps inevitably - been an unpleasant and quite unfair stigmatisation of China and the Chinese. The immediate economic impact of the crisis is also apparent. In the first place those industries that depend upon the movement of goods and people - tourism, airlines, the operators of cruise ships and commercial shipping lines - are already suffering. The crisis has thrown into stark relief the global supply chain behind many of the products we take for granted. The supply of mobile phones, microprocessors, spare parts for the motor industry may all be interrupted. Even the service sector, for example foreign universities who have set up off-shoots in China, will find its income threatened. How long this will all last is impossible to say. So too its ramifications for Beijing. It depends upon how the epidemic plays out. As Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Washington think-tank the Center for Strategic and International Studies, notes: \"The impact on perception of Xi Jinping at home and abroad will depend on the duration of the virus and its impact on the Chinese economy.\" \"If the Chinese Communist Party can control the spread of the epidemic and end the crisis,\" she argues, \"few people inside China will continue to criticise the party for its initial slow response and efforts to cover up the outbreak.\" Many countries who have sought investment from China as part of its Belt and Road initiative will continue to do so, she told me. \"They'll continue to want Chinese loans for infrastructure projects since there aren't other sources of financing.\" But what may be the lasting impact of the crisis? To what extent could it change perceptions of China and especially of President Xi Jinping himself and indeed the whole direction in which he is taking his country? How could the fallout from the coronavirus impact the key relationship between Beijing and Washington? And with clear signs of a technological \"cold war\" already developing between the US and China - the battle over 5G and artificial intelligence - could the tensions surrounding the virus outbreak make things worse? So first of all what does the crisis tell us about China itself? Elizabeth Economy, director for Asia Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, says that inside China there are essentially two distinct narratives. \"The first, which is already being advanced by China's diplomatic corps, is that China has taken extraordinary measures to contain the virus - both for the sake of its own people and as a gift to the rest of the world,\" she says. These actions, they say, \"are enabled by China's particular top-down authoritarian model\". But then there is a second narrative, Economy argues, that says, \"China lost precious time in addressing the crisis because of its political system and its determination to silence independent voices.\" \"Also under Xi Jinping, local officials have become more afraid to acknowledge that things are not going well. This too has hampered an effective response.\" As a long-time China-watcher, Elizabeth Economy told me that what she found especially concerning was \"that even in the wake of Dr Li Wenliang's death, the Communist Party continues to hunt down independent voices\". Dr Li was seen by many in China as a whistleblower and hero; the man who first highlighted the threat posed by the Wuhan virus outbreak. He himself succumbed to the disease. \"One might have hoped,\" says Economy, \"that his death - and the popular response to it - would have signalled to the Chinese leadership the value of transparency and a more open civil society in mounting an effective response to a nationwide crisis.\" So much for perceptions inside China itself, but what about the rest of the world? Elizabeth Economy says that she does not think that the coronavirus will change perceptions of the Chinese government, rather she argues, \"it will simply feed into pre-existing beliefs. Supporters will stress the impressive mobilisation of resources, while detractors will focus on the lack of transparency and concern over the accuracy of Chinese information.\" On the economic front though it could be significant, even just by throwing into stark relief things that we already know. The disease outbreak has underscored the significance of China to the global economy and the importance of diversified supply chains. And this, according to Elizabeth Economy, \"will perhaps encourage more companies not to place too much of their manufacturing in China or rely too heavily on the Chinese consumer market.\" At the recent annual security conference that I attended in Munich, the shadow of the coronavirus and its likely impact upon the medium- and long-term relationship between Washington and Beijing overshadowed much of the debate. Ian Bremmer, founder and chief strategist of Eurasia Group, the leading political risk and consulting firm, told me that the crisis had the potential to significantly re-shape the US-China business relationship, though not exactly for the reasons that many people might think. \"US companies,\" he told me, \"have long been thinking about reducing supply chain exposure to China given increasing trade hostilities, in addition to a Chinese labour force that is increasingly expensive and inefficient.\" With coronavirus, he explains \"US companies may now have the excuse they need to actually make that move. That's obviously an extreme example, but it's a very real prospect down the line, the longer coronavirus continues to cause mayhem.\" At the very least, he argues, \"the coronavirus makes it highly unlikely that China will be able to fully implement the 'Phase One' trade deal it just signed with the US, further intensifying the trend of decoupling between the US and China.\" Bonnie Glaser agrees that China will have difficulty meeting the commitments it made in the \"Phase One\" deal. But, she argues, \"the US will likely cut Beijing some slack\". \"With his eye on re-election,\" she notes, \"President Trump will celebrate his achievement and seek to preserve good relations with Xi, while pledging to make more progress in 'Phase Two'. 2020,\" she says, \"is going to be a year of treading water.\" Here we see the crucial inter-section of economics, diplomacy and domestic politics. Each has a part to play in the relationship between Washington and Beijing, but the salience or relative weight of each factor varies depending upon the circumstances. As Ian Bremmer notes, \"for the time being, Trump has been quite positive about President Xi's handling of the situation\". But, he argues, \"that's largely been the result of Trump being relatively shielded from the fallout of the coronavirus crisis himself\". All this could quite easily change, Bremmer asserts. \"Should the coronavirus start having real economic impact in the US - and in an election year no less - we're more likely to see President Trump go after Xi much more aggressively. \"And this won't just be empty rhetoric. Given the bipartisan hawkishness on China that already exists more broadly in the US these days\", he concludes, \"a Trump decision to turn on Xi would have real impact on the relationship between the world's only two economic superpowers.\" This bipartisan hostility to China was clearly in evidence at the Munich conference. The Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, headed a large congressional delegation and she was outspoken against the Chinese, especially concerning technological rivalry. But to my ear this wasn't just about business or technology. There was a clear ideological element to the debate. Mark Esper, the US defence secretary, preferred to refer to the actions of the \"Chinese Communist Party\" rather than \"China\". Thus the coronavirus crisis has the potential to dramatically worsen the already deteriorating climate between Washington and Beijing. And this could have much broader consequences, not least for the Europeans (or indeed for Washington's Asian allies), who will be caught in the middle. I asked Ian Bremmer if what we saw in Munich - bullish interventions on China from Nancy Pelosi, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defence Secretary Esper - amounted to the declaration of a new global \"high-technology cold war\" between the US and China. \"Close to it,\" was his answer. But he stressed that the Europeans had no interest in getting caught in the middle of this brewing high-tech cold war. \"Indeed,\" he noted, \"it's the first time in the transatlantic relationship you've ever seen the Americans and the Europeans in such disagreement over what their respective top national security concerns should be.\" This in turn could have a profound impact on the already somewhat strained relationship between the US and some of its Nato partners. \"As much as the Americans may be gearing up for a 'cold war' vis-\u00e0-vis China on tech,\" Bremmer told me, \"at the moment it's looking increasingly like a bilateral 'cold war' rather than a global one. And as the Americans begin to actually pivot to Asia on security matters and the Europeans don't, it's also looking likely that there are even rougher waters ahead for the transatlantic relationship.\" Correction 4 March 2020: An earlier version of this article referred to the Coronavirus as a pandemic.

The migrants were among the first to be recruited to rebuild post-war Britain. But there continues to be concern over a scandal which saw some of the generation wrongly face deportation. As the music played in the abbey, Baroness Floella Benjamin was applauded as she briefly danced in the nave. The Liberal Democrat peer and patron of the Windrush Foundation said that she felt \"joy\", adding: \"I was floating, like a bird, free.\" Prime Minister Theresa May, Home Secretary Sajid Javid and London Mayor Sadiq Khan attended the service, along with shadow home secretary Diane Abbott. Among the guests was Baroness Doreen Lawrence, mother of murdered black teenager Stephen. At the scene By Helena Lee, BBC News Under the warm June sun the guests, more than 2,000 of them, queued outside the abbey ahead of the service. They shared stories with each other. They wanted to celebrate. Many of them were families of the Windrush generation. Karen Gibson's mother came to Britain from Guyana in 1962. She said her mother heard stories of \"gold on the streets\" of the UK. There was a heart-warming moment too. A handshake between two men, in their nineties, who unknown to each other, had both been on the Empire Windrush ship 70 years ago. At the service, a short drama telling the story of how Caribbean migrants were invited to \"The Motherland\" to help rebuild post-war Britain was performed by actors. Addressing the congregation, the Reverend Canon Joel Edwards said: \"Settling down hasn't been plain sailing. \"The children of Windrush have experienced over-representation in Britain's prisons and mental health institutions. Knife crimes. \"Underachievement in education and the job market. Settlement has meant racism, sometimes too much policing and not enough protection. And Stephen Lawrence.\" But he added: \"Windrush resilience arises, supremely.\" He described the Windrush as having \"gifted\" Britain with leaders in the worlds of politics, business, education, music and sport and acknowledged the influence of the Caribbean on British cuisine, including \"rice and peas, jerk chicken and Levi Roots sauce in our supermarkets\". Mr Edwards also referenced the scandal that has seen some Windrush members wrongly face deportation. He said: \"In recent months the word 'Windrush' has evoked a great deal of emotion and even anger across our political landscape. In this service of thanksgiving, Windrush means more than migration.\" The service included the first performance of a specially composed anthem entitled Psalm To Windrush: For The Brave And Ingenious. The Very Rev John Hall, Dean of Westminster, wore a robe decorated with a photo montage of aspects of black history in Britain since the arrival of Windrush. John Richards, 92, who came to Britain on the Windrush aged 21, said the service was \"great\". \"It brings back memories, yes, but I'm too old for the emotion,\" he said. Alford Gardner, a member of the Windrush generation, has lived in Leeds most of his life, but said that was not his intention when he arrived. The 92-year-old said: \"The plan was to come to England, get a good job, work for about five years, go back... but it wasn't to be. \"Within five years I had started a family and married. I had bought me house, working hard and settled down.\" Mr Khan said it was a \"moving\" service in honour of a generation that \"contributes so much to our capital\". But Glenda Ceasar, who was born in Dominica in the 1960s, said she never got a British passport and lost her job recently because she could not prove her legal status. She said: \"So many years down the line... we're faced with this. \"The ship to me, the Windrush, it seems as if it was... we were just slaves being brought over here to be punished later on in life. That's the way that I feel.\" Nearly 500 Caribbean migrants from countries including Jamaica, Bermuda and Trinidad exited the Windrush on 22 June 1948 when it docked at Tilbury in Essex. They had applied to job adverts after World War II with the hope of finding long-term employment in the UK, having gained a type of citizenship under the British Nationality Act of 1948. The Westminster Abbey service commemorates the contribution the migrants and their families have made to the UK. Meanwhile, a celebration of Caribbean culture marked the anniversary at Tilbury Docks. The government has also announced Baroness Benjamin is to lead a commemoration committee overseeing the creation of a \"fitting legacy\" to the Windrush generation. A statue celebrating their achievements is among the ideas for the permanent tribute. Baroness Benjamin, a former children's television presenter and Lib Dem peer, was born in Trinidad but emigrated to the UK with her family in 1960. She said: \"This a significant step in recognising the contribution made to Britain by Caribbean people and this committee will make sure the work and sacrifices of the Windrush pioneers will live on in the hearts and minds of future generations.\" The right to remain in the UK for Commonwealth migrants who arrived before 1973 was supposed to be legally guaranteed. But it emerged this year that some migrants from the Windrush generation - many of them who arrived as children - had faced deportation. They were being refused healthcare and access to jobs because they did not have the paperwork to prove their status following a tightening of immigration rules in 2014. The government has since apologised for the crisis and says a dedicated taskforce has now provided documentation to over 2,000 people demonstrating their right to live in the UK.

Egypt is run by its army. Libya has all but disintegrated. But in the midst of all the Middle Eastern chaos, Tunisia has somehow kept its democratic development on track. Since the overthrow of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in 2011 the country has held two competitive and peaceful general elections. Strong forces oppose Tunisian democracy. In March this year jihadists killed 22 people in Tunisia's National Museum. Three months later 38 were murdered in the Sousse beach massacre. But while the jihadist challenge has been both deadly and spectacular, those using violence have enjoyed little popular support. Arguably, a greater threat to political reform has come from the divisions between three powerful elements of Tunisian society: All three groups have had good reason to fear each other. Mutual mistrust In the post-Ben Ali period the Islamists in Ennahda, Tunisia's version of the Muslim Brotherhood, had genuine anxieties about being thrown back into the prisons from which thousands of their activists emerged during the Arab Spring. For their part, the secularists feared that, whatever the Islamists said in public, secretly they wanted to create an Islamic state in which European lifestyles would become impossible. Meanwhile, the elite families who benefited from decades of cronyism in the Ben Ali era, worried about being held accountable for their ill-gotten gains. Some Tunisians have accused the old elite of wanting to defend their economic interests by restoring paternalistic, authoritarian rule. Anti-terror legislation, for example, has been used to close down civil liberties. And yet, somehow, despite all the problems and obstacles, Tunisia has remained in the vanguard of democratic development in the Middle East. Peace Prize The Nobel Committee has given the credit to the National Dialogue Quartet. Drawn from four civil society groups - unions, lawyers, employers and human rights activists - it became active at a crucial moment in 2013 when the assassination of two prominent, left-wing politicians threatened to spill over into a broad civil conflict. The murders were taken as a sign that the Islamists in the country would stop at nothing to achieve political dominance. The anti-Islamist opposition walked out of the constitutional assembly. It was at this point that the Quartet set about the business of solving Tunisians' differences through politics not violence. Tunisia's National Dialogue Quartet The surprise winner of this year's Nobel Peace Prize has played a key role in mediating between the different parties in the country's post-Arab Spring government. The Quartet is credited with creating a national dialogue between the country's Islamist and secular coalition parties amid deepening political and economic crisis in 2013. Tunisia's revolution - also known as the Jasmine Revolution - began in late 2010 and led to the ousting of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011, followed by the country's first free democratic elections. Kaci Kullman Five, the chair of the Nobel peace committee, said the Quartet's role in Tunisia's democratisation was \"directly comparable to the peace conferences mentioned by Alfred Nobel in his will\". Nobel Peace Prize winners through the years Africa's Nobel Peace Prize winners New constitution The mediators only succeeded because of the commitment of other Tunisians to pluralism and the democratic process. Unlike its counterpart in Egypt, for example, the Tunisian army has never had political ambitions. And during the political crisis of 2013, the Islamists, disproving all their critics' predictions, set aside their election victory. After protracted negotiations managed by the Quartet, Ennahda gave up power so as to achieve a broader political settlement. Tunisia's transitional period culminated in 2014 with agreement on a new constitution and the election of a coalition government that included all the major political forces in the country. Challenges ahead The Arab Spring began in Tunisia when a street vendor, Mohamed Bouazizi, became so angry at being unable to make even a modest living that he set himself alight. Many in Tunisia's relatively well-educated population remain deeply frustrated that they cannot fulfil their potential and provide for their families. Tunisia's Islamist and secular politicians are both learning that, for many in the electorate, the question of what role religion should play in politics is a second order concern. For most voters the most pressing issues are the poor provision of basic government services, the uncertain security situation and, most crucially of all, the lack of jobs. The economic and political challenges ahead are real. But for the moment Tunisians can look back at the last four years - and at their Quartet's Nobel Prize - and celebrate the fact that, so far, compared to everyone else in the region, they have managed to keep the ideals of the Arab Spring alive.", "output": "A group of civil society organisations in Tunisia has been awarded the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize .

The charity had previously opposed all forms of so-called mandatory reporting. New inquiries into child abuse could consider possible law changes. Mr Wanless, the chief executive of the child protection charity, is heading a review looking at concerns that the Home Office failed to act on allegations of child sex abuse contained in a dossier handed over in the 1980s by former Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens. Another independent inquiry, looking at historical sexual abuse and institutions' protection of children, will be led by retired senior judge Elizabeth Butler-Sloss. Meanwhile, a former West Mercia Police officer has told the BBC he saw documents in the 1990s suggesting the existence of a paedophile network involving public officials and clergy. Terry Shutt was involved in the 1992 arrest of Peter Righton, a founding member of the Paedophile Information Exchange who was convicted of importing child pornography. Mr Shutt, a former detective constable, told the BBC that five suitcases of letters found when Righton's home was raided pointed to a paedophile network but he was \"confident that the main link into the establishment\" was not followed up. The Metropolitan Police said it could not comment on the case but a police source from the time said it was \"nonsense\" to say the investigation was closed down. Mr Shutt's comments are among a number of claims relating to the alleged activities of child abusers dating back to the 1960s. Home Secretary Theresa May has said Baroness Butler-Sloss's review will examine the case for mandatory reporting. Historical child abuse claims: Key questions answered Why has this come up now? Labour MP Simon Danczuk last week called on Leon Brittan to say what the then home secretary did with documents he was passed in the 1980s containing allegations about powerful figures and paedophilia. What happened to the files? Lord Brittan passed them to Home Office officials and a 2013 review found the minister had acted appropriately. What did the papers allege? The allegations, compiled by Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens, were set to \"blow the lids off\" the lives of powerful child abusers, the MP's son has said. The late Mr Dickens said he planned to expose eight such figures. Read more: Historical child abuse claims explained 'Priority' Mr Wanless told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"If someone consciously knows that there is a crime committed against a child, and does nothing about it because they put the reputation of the organisation above the safety of that child, that should be a criminal offence.\" The NSPCC would be open to discussions about what form the new law should take, he added. Alan Wardle, head of policy at the NSPCC, told BBC Breakfast its priority is to criminalise the \"act of cover up\". \"What we've got to do is find a way that people protect children first and ensure that their reputation is not the primary concern,\" he said. \"That's a problem we've seen in some of these institutions, the institutional cover up where child abuse has been swept under the carpet and not dealt with. \"People have been quietly moved on to abuse children in other institutions.\" Alan Wood, president of the Association of Directors of Children's Services said he would like a system which is \"much more open\". He said: \"We're against anything that makes the system more complex, we have to give much more confidence to people in the system. \"I'm not sure the first step is to move towards mandatory requirement for reporting because people need to be confident that they can report effectively, people need to be confident that they're reporting the right thing.\" Timeline: Historical child abuse claims 1982-84: Conservative MP Geoffrey Dickens says he plans to expose eight prominent figures as paedophiles. He also gives files to then Home Secretary Leon Brittan, who passes them to officials August 2013: The Home Office says copies of Mr Dickens's material were \"not retained\" but that Lord Brittan acted appropriately in dealing with the allegations 7 July 2014: Lord Brittan dismisses claims he failed to act appropriately. Meanwhile, Home Secretary Theresa May announces two reviews of historical child sex abuse allegations - one into the way public bodies handled claims and the other into the Home Office's handling of paedophilia allegations Full timeline 'Growing consensus' In many other countries, including the US, Australia and France, people can be prosecuted for covering up abuse. In Britain, child protection organisations - including the NSPCC - have traditionally felt there was no need for such a law. The charity said boarding schools, residential care homes and hospitals should have to pass information on to the police or the local authority, rather than just investigate themselves. Liz Dux, a lawyer with Slater & Gordon, which represents 176 victims of serial abuser Jimmy Savile, said the NSPCC's turnaround is \"welcome and significant\". Last year Sir Keir Starmer, the former director of public prosecutions for England and Wales, became the first senior legal figure to call for a law which would require all institutions to report allegations to an outside body. He said: \"There is now a growing consensus that mandatory reporting should be introduced. This shift in position is significant. The real challenge now is to devise a model that works in practice.\" Peter Saunders, chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said \"I think this is a really significant U-turn for the NSPCC and hugely welcome - it's a big step in the right direction.\" In the last year churches and the children's commissioner have expressed their support for mandatory reporting. Education Secretary Michael Gove was opposed to it but said victims had made a compelling case for it, and he is currently reviewing the law.

He said the UK would leave the EU on 31 October \"no ifs, no buts\". Mr Cairns has now served under three prime ministers. He is the only minister who has served in the same job under David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson.

The High Street Innovation Fund, launched a year ago, was part of the government's response to Ms Portas' review of the High Street. Results have been mixed. Shop vacancies have gone down in seven towns, but more shops overall have closed than opened. The Department for Communities and Local Government says the pilots are breathing new life into the towns. The 12 pilot areas are Bedford, Croydon, Dartford, Greater Bedminster, Liskeard, Margate, Market Rasen, Nelson, Newbiggin-by-the-Sea, Stockport, Stockton-on-Tees and Wolverhampton. Struggling stores Launched a year ago, the \"Portas Pilots\" were created to showcase innovative ways of getting people back into their local shops. But exclusive research commissioned for BBC Radio 4's You and Yours shows that in 10 of the 12 towns, more units closed than opened in the past year, with a loss of 95 units in all. Only two towns showed signs of improvement, with Bedminster and Margate adding units in the past year. In total, about 700 units closed, while fewer than 600 opened in their place. Units include cafes, banks and pubs as well as shops, while vacancy rates apply only to shops. In Stockton-on-Tees, one of the pilot areas, local traders said the funding was not being spent quickly enough and their businesses could be gone by the time it is. Cath Pillar, of Balloonatics, a party supplies shop, said she was now using her own savings to keep it afloat, adding: \" It's like nursing a baby. We don't want to lose it.\" The research was carried out by the Local Data Company. Director Matthew Hopkinson said: \"If more shops close than open, then that's when you start to see the decay of the High Street and also a rise in vacancy rates.\" The figures suggest rapidly changing environments on the High Streets, presenting problems for shoppers confused by constant change, which makes them reluctant to return. Cathy Parker, of Manchester Metropolitan University, says this churn can be healthy when innovators come in, but only when units are replaced and towns are not experiencing the kind of net loss outlined in the figures. Mixed picture The shop vacancy rates in the 12 pilot towns show improvements in some areas and decline in others. In Newbiggin-by-the-Sea, Liskeard, Bedminster, Margate, Dartford, Bedford and Wolverhampton, the number of vacant shops has fallen, suggesting new businesses have arrived and populated previously empty ones. This may be due to prolonged use or temporary usage, such as a pop-up store. The research also revealed that Market Rasen, Nelson, Stockport, Croydon and Stockton-on-Tees all had more vacant shops, which can be seen as boarded-up or empty units. The Minister for Local Growth, Mark Prisk, said the intention of the scheme was to harness the energy of local people. Mary Portas told You and Yours: \"There is no simple solution to the crisis on our High Streets. There are no quick fixes but 400 towns up and down the country are working on different plans to try and reinvigorate their High Street. \"Let's celebrate their achievements so far and learn and share ideas. Real change will take time.\"", "output": "Ten of the 12 government-funded \"Portas Pilot\" towns have seen a fall in the number of occupied retail units.", "category": "Summarization 476.json"}]
