And what I saw simply lacked comedic value.    He's often compared to Dave Chappelle, but Dave Chappelle's racial remarks are made in a very smart, interesting, and often unique manner, and Chappelle show didn't need to be racist to be funny (like the Rick James skit)    Mind of Mencia is very formulaic and often breaks down into: White people do _________, while Mexicans do _________.

This movie is not for those with queasy stomachs for there are a number of scenes which could make the average person puke. That is providing they are not edited out for this upcoming release. One being where Baron Frankenstein says, \" to know life, one must F... the gallbladder\" which he does after cutting open the female Frankenstein monster.

Rita Vogt (Bibiana Beglau) is one of a group of West German terrorists who spring fellow terrorist, Andrea (Harald Schrott) from jail. Several people are shot during the jailbreak, and the group goes on the lam to Paris. While in Paris, Rita kills a policeman, and the terrorists are once again on the run--this time they slip into East Germany with the help of Stasi officer Erwin Hull (Martin Wuttke) who befriended Rita when she was recognized upon entering East Berlin before. Since the heat is on the group, Erwin makes an offer--the terrorists can accept a new life--with new identities in East Germany, or they can be flown out to Beirut. While everyone else elects Beirut, Rita decides to stay in East Germany.     Rita assumes a new identity in East Germany, and her adjustment to her environment is at the heart of \"The Legend of Rita\" from director Volker Schlondorff. The plot places Rita in some interesting situations. Her first job, for example, is in a factory where she befriends Tatjana (Nadja Uhl). Tatjana loathes East Germany, and would love to live in the West. She can't understand why Rita (now living under an assumed name) would give up Western freedoms and chose to live under Communist rule. In the meantime, Rita's former rebelliousness against the state has simply disappeared, and she's become a drone--speaking the party line and accepting whatever she's told to do. When Rita's new identity is threatened, she has little choice but to move on--leaving Tatjana and their budding lesbian affair.     The film fails to fulfill its promise, however, on several layers. Rita becomes a pawn for the Stasi--every move she makes is watched, and every conversation she has is taped. The film could have chosen to tackle some fascinating complex arguments--Rita's ideology, for example, and the challenge she faces in either rejecting her beliefs or sticking to them in the face of such nauseating, and threatening Orwellian bureaucracy. The plot shows Rita as mindlessly accepting what she is told to do--she doesn't question her freedoms, and by making Rita a drone, she is a far less interesting character. Instead, the film concentrates on Rita's two love interests. Also, if you are expecting to discover something about the Red Army Faction (RAF) here, keep looking. This is not a film about the RAF. There is an excellent book by Stefan Aust on the subject, but it's rare to find a copy in English. I recommend \"How It All Began\" By Bommi Baumann and \"Televisionaries: The Red Army Faction Story 1963-1993\" by Tom Vague. \"The Legend of Rita\" is worth watching for all fans of German film out there. Overall, the film's message argues strongly against aligning oneself with any political ideals.

This film is an artfully crafted vision of the old west.      By any measure one of John Wayne's better movies.   I really can't feature this movie being made with anyone else in the lead.  He fits the character like a glove as a tough gnarled and aging rancher.    Roscoe Brown is another inspired piece of casting as the sagely cook.  His was a Oscar caliber performance.    In my book, this picture has Bruce Dern's best performance as an evil doer.  His psychopathic rustler is a flawless jewel.    And despite these excellent qualities what really makes this film so good and sets it apart is it's concept-      Cowboys herding cattle that are really boys, facing the harsh unforgiving environment of the old west and dealing with it as best they can.    Casting the cowboys they used a mix of Hollywood child actors and kids that grew up on ranches and had riding and roping skills.  This worked out incredibly well.    The script is tight and the movie does not have one flabby moment.    To top it off- the musical score is by John Williams.

As a \"kind of sewer\" of these Italian sexplotation flicks, Capt. Freaky knows a good film when he sees one!  The first of this dual DVD, \"White Slave\" was not worth watching or mentioning for any reason.  Piss poor special effects of beheadings...no sex in the film whatsoever...and nothing to make anyone horny or subsequently enjoy themselves.    On the other hand, the second film, \"Caligula Reincarnated as Hitler\" was way better than what I expected.  Just the exceptional location of Northern Italy's lake district gives it one star.  Furthermore, the young blonde star of the film is gorgeous and someone both men and women would find attractive to sleep with.  There are some five star sexual violence scenes that are unfortunately too brief.  Beatings, whippings, gang raping of women prisoners, dipping naked women into vats of lime, hanging the young blonde star nude and upside down over a box of live rats!  I mean, hey you \"sicko\" Nazi fans, is this something or what?    There are no actual hard core sex scenes, however, there are multiple simulated sex scenes that are quite hot to watch.  I think there is significant sexual tension in scenes throughout this very good storyline.  If you are into the whole \"Nazi sex slave camp\" thing....this is by far, the best of that genre I have come across.  And because I only paid $9.99 for this double feature...it makes it a 5 star film for me by all catagories.

Alex is so charming and funny at the same time, with his ideas of hip hop and the American culture; and wisdom that seems beyond his years.

Alex's grandfather, who insisted that he was blind, yet he drove the tour car that they all rode in, was such a character; a combination of harsh from the years of hardship he'd had in his life, and yet with a soft tender side underneath that showed up every once in a while.

My watching this film resulted from a conversation with a friend beginning with politics and spiraling down to the future of our world. The premise of the film was disturbing to say the least. I have never been a true fan of Charleton Heston who in my opinion always has overacted. However, Edward G. Robinson seemed as comfortable playing this character as he has been in the many different roles he has played. His performance was truly heartfelt, bringing to mind the current debate on \"ending one's own life with dignity\". I shutter to think that this is life as it should be though. But Robinson's character acted on the decision with the counterfeit courage and ultimate hopelessness that accompanied it in such a way that you could very well empathize with him. I found the other actors to be somewhat bland. Perhaps this was acting at that point in time, but some actors can make the most of roles and others cannot. The story line was unique, but the script was lacking. A re-make today by Steven Spielberg might be worthwhile seeing.

Passion's way movie is based on the Novel \"The Reef\" by Edith Wharton. The American novelist Edith Wharton spent most of her professional life in Europe. \"The Reef\" exemplifies her close observation of Americans in France, their inner lives and social conflicts.    On his way to France to see his beloved, the widowed Anna Leath (outstanding perfomance by the always beautiful and talented Sela Ward), Charles Darrow (Timothy Dalton-former James Bond) receives a telegram telling him not to come due to an \"unexpected obstacle.\" As time passes and he doesn't receive an explanation for the delay, he experiences growing feelings of disappointment and humiliation.     As he waits undetermined as to whether to go back to London or to press forward, he encounters Sophy Viner, a recently unemployed servant of a woman whose dinners he once attended. She is on her way to Paris to look up old friends and to pursue a theatrical career. Darrow, who feels sorry for himself and the loss he thinks he is about to suffer, finds himself manipulating Sophy into staying with him to attend the theatre and finally into a short liaison. He is unaware that she has fallen in love with him and his kindness in her hour of uncertainty.    Four months later, Anna Leath eagerly anticipates Darrow's arrival. During the walk they had in the garden, Anna expresses her love for Charles.    Anna: \"I'm not a naive young girl. I know...of course I KNOW...but there are things a woman feels...when what she knows doesn't make any difference. It's not that I want you to explain--I mean about that particular evening. It's only that I want you to know the whole of my feeling. I didn't know what it was till I saw you again. I never dreamed I should say such things to you!\"     Charles: \"I never dreamed I should be here to hear you say them!but now that you have said it.... the only thing that matters is that we are here together and I want you to be my wife.\"    Anna is also excited because her stepson, Owen Leath, wants to do something that they know will upset his aristocratic, old-fashioned grandmother; he wants to marry Anna's daughter's governess, who is none other than Sophy Viner.    Darrow and Sophy's secret is safe with one another, yet Darrow is faced by the uncomfortable fact that the ignorant Anna wants him to support Owen's choice of a woman he knows to be unsuitable but whom he pities. He tries to convince Sophy that Owen is not right for her. \"You'd rather I didn't marry any friend of yours,\" she says \"not as a question, but as a mere dispassionate statement of fact.\" She is a painful reminder that both of them have broken social conventions.    This is a outsanding movie for people who appreciate understanding the complex nature of human behavior. The movie finishes with these lines:    \"What I meant was that when you've lived a little longer you'll see what complex blunderers we all are: how we're struck blind sometimes, and mad sometimes--and then, when our sight and our senses come back, how we have to set to work, and build up, little by little, bit by bit, the precious things we'd smashed to atoms without knowing it.

When I saw so-so actioner 'Belly of the Beast,' I thought Steven Seagal was well on the way to his 'comeback,' finally realizing that authentic-looking martial arts actions are what gave him the stardom, which is however fading away very fast.  Now I saw this film, and know I was terribly wrong.  His next film 'Out of Reach' is a huge letdown, probably the final nail in the coffin.    Don't get me wrong, I really like his films made in the 90s, like 'Under Siege' action-packed escapism entertainment.  In 'Out of Reach' Steven Seagal plays one Billy Ray Lancing, an ex-agent living in the wilds of Canada, where he finds injured animals and bring them to health.  Yet another embironmentally conscious hero from Seagal, but ... doesn't he see that these social messages have nothing to do with making good action films?     Add to that, Billy Ray exchanges letters with a little girl Irena living in an orphanage in Poland.  When it is reported that she is missing, and a nasty businee of 'human traffic' is suspected, he travels there incognito, secures a help from the local policewoman (while he has no ID), speaks a bit of French, and hits a PC keyboard like a pro, better than a Polish technichian, to restore a secretly recorded image.  We meet a hissable baddie (Matt Schultz), but anyway we are sure Seagal will win, because he has taught the little girl how to decode the 'cyphers' (and check out how she uses it, a scene which makes unexpectedly hilarious 'you-gotta-be-kiddin' 0moment).     So, how about the fact-moving kicking and chopping, once Seagal's trademark?  No, these thrilling martial arts actions are gone forever in this new film.  You just don't have actions in 'Out of Reach.'  As I counted them, well, in the first 40 minutes of 'Out Of Reach' you can see only two action set-pieces: in one, Seagal's hero Billy breaks a few arms and legs of the unkind government agents (about 30 seconds), and much later Billy smashes the glass of hotel bathroom and drops an assassin onto a parked car (another 30 seconds).  That's it, that's all.    There are more actions to come, obligatory shoot-outs and sword fights, but not enough to call 'Out of Reach' an action film.  The pace is terribly tedious, the images (when at night) are too dark, and worst of all, not only Seagal but slmost all the Polish cast sleepwalk in the pedestrian story.  Little girl looks bored while she is supposed to be in danger.     Finally, about director Po-Chih Leong (fairly good in Jude Law's brooding thriller with a vampire theme 'The Immortal') who is the least likely choice in Seagal's entire filmography to succeed in staging exciting actions, and the results turned out as we feared.  The slow-paced story is sleep-inducing, and what little action bits in the film are amateurish at best, with poorly-constructed shots in which fast editing attempts to conceal Seagal is no longer moving his bodies like he used to do.", "output": "NEG", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1104.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given product reviews about dvds.

I was expecting a bit more from this movie, but I guess if I had really thought about it, anything starring Joan Crawford at this point in her life, and the always rebellious/troubled/angry John Garfield, could not have risen above what the film ended up being. My dislikes:  the music; often way too loud, way too much, very very annoying to me. Had to continually turn down the volume when the film went musical, which was much too often. Joan's character: well, she was middle aged, married, downing glass after glass of alcoholic beverages constantly, a chain smoker; no decent man would be attracted to that sort of woman. Well, John Garfield wasn't a decent man. I have yet to see a John Garfield role I liked...he always portrays characters who are angry and rebellious, self centered, going against life the wrong way. I didn't like him, I didn't like Joan, and so I didn't really care about them and ultimately the point of the movie. They had one of those uncomprehendable romances where seeminly they are deeply in love, yet they don't show it or speak it and you definitely don't feel it.  At the end, Joan was just over the top as a drama queen and by this time I was so fed up with this whole film I just kept saying, \"okay Joan, we know you are going to take your final swim so please just get on with it already so we can be finished with this boring and aggravating movie!\" But no, she had to walk at least 2 miles down the beach in her evening gown and high heels, and weep and weep, and make faces, and clutch her hair in despair, and on and on she went and all the while the loud music is playing out her \"sorrow and pain\"! What a relief when it was  finally over! There are some films that leave me feeling very upset and agitated, and this was definitely one of them. What helped me get over it was to read some of the great reviews here on Amazon...some were so funny because they were so true about the stupidity of this movie that I laughed and laughed! Laughter is indeed a great healer!  I also did not go for the cynical piano player friend and his constant stream of one liners. Cynical humor isn't humor and it isn't funny; it's pathetic and sad.

One of the great period pieces that the Brits do so well, this is the story of the British bomb disposal squads during World War Two, done by John Hawkesworth, the same guy who produced \"Upstairs, Downstairs.\"  The story is told through a fictional bomb disposal squad commanded by a young engineering student turned lieutenant, Brian Ash.    Fascinating story and technical details when they stick to the actual bomb disposal material, but the personal stories are so much cliched fluff--the main one is that Ash falls in love with the daughter of a scientist working on the bomb disposal effort.  They are temporarily blocked by the fact that she already has a husband who is also doing an important job--he is one of the codebreakers at Bletchley Park working on the Enigma secret.  But not to worry--hubby obligingly kills himself so the lovers can get together with a clear conscience.  As the Church lady would say \"How convenient!\"    Also the one extra is nothing much, a documentary from the History Channel, not on the British bomb disposal effort during the War, but just a general piece on bomb disposal in general.

Yup, not to marginalize the other people who made the show great, but that's basically what it boils down to.  When I saw none of these people in the opening credits, I was concerned.  The people who did make this movie, however, confirmed my fears by making an extremely mediocre film, if not just plain sucky.  I mean seriously, this wouldn't even have passed as an interesting episode of the tv show, let a lone a film.      In one of the extras, the director or someone says that he just wanted to make a \"fun\" film and that they finished the script in no time at all.  Guess what, it shows.  That is except for the fun part, but the lack of thought and vision part is definitely apparent.  The plot is extremely cliched and stupid.  Maybe if any of the 3 girls were interesting at all, it would've been passable.  However, we ended up with an extremely annoying, rebeling daddy's girl who looks like a Hale Berry clone, a Renee Montoya clone, and some girl tied down to a jailed boyfriend.  Yeah, why should I give a crap about any of these chicks?  In the extras they said they didn't want to do something definitive with Batwoman, but I call it laziness and lack of effort.  If Batwoman's secret identity was one good character it might have worked, but instead we get three worthless ones.      I was at least expecting some lesbian subtext to make things somewhat interesting after I heard the idea to bring Batwoman back as a character in the comic was sparked by this movie.  However, any subtext in this film was extremely minimal if even existent.  I did like the fact that they continued the Barbara/Bruce text, but it was only in one short scene.  I guess having Batgirl and Batwoman in the same movie would be too much for some reason I can't comprehend.    The music to this movie isn't that great as everyone else said, especially compared to Shirley Walker's beyond amazing score.  However, I disagree with everyone who said that the animation was good.  It looked like low-budget, digitally colored, corny crap to me.  Definitely no where even close to the amazing, noir-influced film making from the tv show.  I was also a fan of Penguin's voice in the show, but here he's played by the Mad Hatter's voice actor instead.  I don't know if Penguin's voice acotr died or that he was just busy, but Penguin just wasn't the same this way.      Oever all, I can't find much to like in this film.  I did find the inclusion of fan-service including Batwoman's costume a nice gesture, but definitely not enough to save this film.    So yeah, only get this if you're a completest.  If you're just starting to buy Batman for all means get the tv box-sets instead.

Into The Woods is one of my Sondheim favorites.  Having seen the PBS presentation of this, I am thoroughly dismayed at how poorly this DVD is edited.  Rather than allowing one to be engaged by the staging and character interaction, this DVD uses pan and scan to isolate characters and provide sometimes inappropriate close-ups.  This especially detracts from what one wishes to see in a play; the staging.  By forcing the viewer's perspective, this version does a disservice to a very fine play that investigates our relationships with each other through fairy tales and their aftermath.

This is NOT a story about Black River Falls, as the description indicates.

There are very few photographs from the period and the film footage is mostly an attempt at what I can only call \"modern art\".  Cut out about 20 minutes of \"filler\" and this would be a somewhat better film.    Basically, it's a collection of \"strange but true stories\" that have no connection to each other, except they took place around the same period of time and took place somewhere in the state of Wisconsin.

When viewing the same problems, what makes one person call for violence and another person call for understanding?  There are probably many reasons.  The title to this review is an Anais Nin quote that I think suggests part of the answer.    Branford Marsalis comments about Sting's music:  The music is a tremendous social statement.  Musicians are always social critics.  And that's the biggest problem with pop music is that they don't have any more social critics.  They don't have enough people with the intelligence or the balls to stand up and see the world for what it is and say \"This s$!t is out.\"    Bring on the Night is a movie about the launching of The Dream of the Blue Turtles album and the creation of an interracial band.  The songs on the album are protest songs, protesting cold war propoganda, nuclear waste, possessive love, pride that refuses to forgive, and many other things.  For example, \"If You Love Somebody Set Them Free\" is a response to his earlier \"Every Breath You Take\".    Sting's intent was to be disarming, to disarm through the discussion and publication of ideas.  He took a stand by stating his positions.  He did not choose to be silent or abandon the issues he cared about.   In his mind, love is not hidden and not silent.  Love doesn't say, \"I care about this issue, but don't tell anyone what I think.\"   Good protest songs are made to be sung.    One world is enough for all of us.  Love is the seventh wave.  I spent too many years at war with myself.  Doctor has told me, it's no good for my health.      Sting spends time writing a song to his ex, where he laid out both his admission of guilt and an olive branch for reconciliation:  If I built this fortress around your heart, encircled you in trenches and barbed wire, then let me build a bridge, for I cannot fill the chasm, and let me set the battlements on fire.    This movie is the most fluid rock band film I've seen, and both the music and interviews discuss substantive issues.

I initially saw this played on the now defunct TRIO satellite channel.  At the time, I owned a once played copy of Doolittle.  After hearing all of the commentary on the importance of the Pixies to modern music, seeing the powerful (yet physically still) nature of their live performance, and seeing some of the music videos for the first time, I was convinced that Doolittle was worth a genuine try.    Yes, the Brits in \"Gouge\" do some kissing-up, but you can tell (they're not actors, after all), that it is truly sincere.  Bowie and Bono, while neither one is half the artist of B.F., do seem especially informed and heart-felt in their analysis and praise.  How humbling it must be to have so many renowned artists and journalists praise your work !  This is a good primer for further study of the band - it was for me.    I'm in a cover band (as David Bowie says in the DVD - everyone who's heard Pixies, forms a band), since I feel a strong urge to try to cover Pixies' music.  The other members didn't know of their work, so I am going to use this DVD as a seminar on the Pixies' work.  I watch it regularly, for personal inspiration - I can't get enough.  Thom Yorke (of Radiohead) says that you must be \"that good for a start\" - we are going to give it a shot.      I was in high school when the more favored 3 CDs were published, but alas, was never exposed.

I feel that this is a very satisfying DVD, and a DEAL ( no pun intended) for the price of &lt; $20 - a quarter what I paid for my wife and I to see them live.

Coppala was right out of college when he was asked to do \"Finian's Rainbow\". It had been a big hit on Broadway in the 40's but predated the civil rights movement.  Coppala had the task of updating it for 1968.    Fred Astaire is 69 in the title role and this was his last role dancing and singing. This was the first times since the beginning of Astaire's career that he didn't have control over the direction of his musical numbers. Coppala was an inexperienced director and fired Hermes Pan, Fred's chorographer. He admits that it was his fault that  Fred's big number in the film didn't come out the way should.    Petula Clark is wonderful as Astaire's daughter. Tommy Steele who was also in \"The Happiest Millionare\" and \"Half a Sixpence\" plays a part typical of his personality.   There is very little chemistry between Petula Clark and her love interest, Dan Franck.  PLOT:  Finian(Astaire) is an Irishman that steals a pot of gold from Og (Tommy Steele). He heads toRainbow Valley, which is right next to Fort Knox, Kentucky, where he thinks burying the gold will multiply his riches.  He meets some people, Woody and Silent Sue, and gives them money to save their land from the bigot senator (Keenan Wynn).  In return he wants part of their land to secretly bury the gold.  Og follows Finian to get his gold back. He is turning into a mortal because he has lost his pot of gold.  Meanwhile, Finian's daughter(Petula Clark) is falling in love with a local, Woody (Dan Franck).    Nicely restored with great special features.

I'm a fan of the 1999 \"The Mummy\" and was understandably looking forward to this sequel. In the summer of 2001 I went to catch it at the theater with two friends and after about ten minutes we were all bored senseless by the incredible bombardment of action and F/X. We just layed back in our seats for the next two hours in utter tedium.      It's a curious thing that too much action (and F/X) in a film can be boring. It may not seem logical but it's true, and \"The Mummy Returns\" is Exibit A. I recently considered the possibility that my first impression may have been in error so I decided to re-watch it after over five years. Yet, after a mere 10-15 minutes I was again completely detached from the picture, even though there were all kinds of exciting things going on, or, at least, things that SHOULD HAVE been exciting.      \"The Mummy Returns\" has a lot going for it: A great cast, locations, costumes, cinematography, F/X, etc. In addition it has a great Indiana Jones appeal. Unfortunately it all adds up to a cinematic piece of excrement. What went wrong? Simply put, no substance. \"The Mummy Returns\" abandons the characters, and the plot is utilized simply as a flimsy clothesline for action and F/X sequences.    FINAL ANALYSIS: \"The Mummy Returns\" has so many ingredients right, but it somehow utterly fails. It's unadulterated cinematic JUNK. It should be utilized in filmmaking classes as the quintessential example of style over substance -- having all the right elements, including budget, and stupefyingly fumbling the ball.

Let me start by saying that I may need to quit listening to the opinions of some of my co-workers in regards to movies to watch, at least when it comes to the horror genre. Numerous people where I work told me that this movie, \"The Descent\" was absolutely one of the best horror movies ever to be made.  In their defense, my co-workers weren't the only people with this opinion, many critics and other moviegoers said the same thing.  Well, apparently the hype that was built up for me regarding this movie was more than the film could live up to, because I was sorely disappointed, but more on that later, for now I will give you my plot summary for last year's supposed horror spectacular, \"The Descent\"    \"The Descent\" begins with a young woman on vacation with her family and friends, when her husband and her daughter suffer a tragic accident. One year later at the prodding of those same friends, she accompanies them on a spelunking adventure, the problem is none of her friends have ever been to this cave, in fact it's a newly discovered cave that no one has explored as yet.  So as they attempt to explore the unexplored these brave young women become trapped in the cave.  Making matters worse, this cave is not like any ordinary cave, for this one is inhabited by bloodthirsty mutant creatures who have just found their next meal.    At the beginning of watching this movie I was really interested in the developing story, and the shocking opener really caught my attention, giving me a sense that this movie is going to be different than most horror movies by actually giving you the unexpected.  However, once the story gets to the part where the girls are inside the cave, which is actually where the majority of the film takes place, things begin to go awry for the picture.  At first, the filmmakers were doing a good job of using the claustrophobic atmosphere, giving the audience a sense of entrapment and anxiety which served to heighten the suspense regarding the possibility of impending doom.  Then the filmmakers introduce a fact that I felt completely derailed the movie, this is a cave that no one has been in, and these girls are hardly professional.  So, who in their right mind would put all of their friends lives in possible jeopardy just to be the first to explore a newly discovered cave.  It's absolutely stupid, especially when placed viewed in the context of the character's interaction and companionship with each other, none of these girls would do this to each other. After this occurs the mutants show up, a plot point that I was hoping would help put the movie back in the right direction; however, this is where the movie begins to unwind even faster, because it's now just one gory scene after another, and the movie is nothing more than your average monster movie.  A decision I somewhat agreed with, yet still didn't agree with was the decision to keep the mutants origins unknown.  On the one hand this served to add to the mystery of why they are attacking these girls, you just assume they're cannibalistic, but on the other it would have been nice to know how they got there.    Even though \"The Descent\" was hyped as being one of the best horror movies of recent time, by both my friends and many critics and moviegoers, to me it was merely another average addition to a genre that is already full of mediocrity.    \"The Descent\" is unrated and contains violence and language", "output": "NEG", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1104.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given product reviews about dvds.

I suppose if you never read the book, you might think this movie is good... maybe even charming.

They head West together, until Willie Jack abandons her at a WalMart.  They part ways on more than one level - his life goes as low as a life can, and her life rises beautifully.  It's a study in contrasts, and it's done impeccably in the novel, with a plethora of complex characters to richen the journey... but it didn't translate because of Hollywood's froo-froo mentality.    Hollywood cut Benny Goodluck - a main character in the novel - completely out and shaved Moses(another major character) down to a bit part while making Novalee's one-visit-mother a major player.  And they DESTROYED Forney... who is supposed to be eccentric, late-thirties genius, withdrawn and strange... they turned him into a twenty-something easy-going stud type with a crooked smile.  SO. NOT. FORNEY.  I never wanted to jump thru the screen and slap people so badly in my life.  That horrid.

The whole cast is wasted in this movie, and most of which I have seen in movies that I liked better.

If your a Tim Allen fan, please do yourself a favor, and get either the Santa Clause movies, or the Toy Story movies, and avoid this movie at all costs.

Dave Douglas (Tim Allen) is a lawyer, that dislikes dogs, and even has a case against animal activist Justin Forrester (Joshua Leonard).

Carly is not only a is both Forrester's student and a budding animal advocate herself, and her brother is trying out for football like his Dad, even through he secretly hates it, and didn't sign up for the fall musical. And then there is a mad scientist (Robert Downey Jr.), trying to extract the secret of immortality from the shaggy hide of a 300-year-old dog he had kidnapped from a Tibetan monastery. And Carly even kidnaps it from Grant & Strictland, and brings him home, nad even trouble starts when the dog bites Douglas, that gets him starting acting like a dog too, and even looking exactly like him at times. The movie expects us to believe the dog is 300 years old, which would be impossible, since neither dogs or people live that long, all I can say we are in an era of movies being made out of sequels and remakes, and this is one to avoid at all costs.", "output": "NEG", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1104.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given product reviews about dvds.

I saw the preview of this cartoon on Netflix. Seeing the teen characters dancing and having fun on the beach (minus Daria, who sits by herself reading a newspaper - with interruptions), I knew I had to buy this. And I love it!     \"Is It Fall Yet?\" deals with the main characters' experiences during Summer vacation. The highlight: \"The Tom Thing\" -as Trent Lane, Jane's musician brother, nicely puts it.  Daria and Tom have fallen in love, and are dating.  Tom and Jane have broken up.  This situation dents the friendship of Daria and Jane.      The two bonus episodes on the dvd (\"Fire\" and \"Dye! Dye, My Darling!\")  show how \"The Tom Thing\" happened.  It's recommended to watch those two bonus episodes FIRST as they lead up to the emotional turmoil and love triangle of Daria, Jane and Tom that is carried over into the movie.     Adding to Daria's anguish, her mother enrolls her to be a camp counselor at the `OK-to-Cry Corral' summer camp.  Working with her are her teachers, dorky Mr. O'Neill and Anthony DeMartino (with his trademark bloodshot eyeball that widens when he's very irritated).    The other `Daria' characters have their own situations.  Lovelorn Jane goes to a bohemian artist retreat that's out of Lawndale.  Dim-witted lovers Kevin and Brittany provide comic relief as they both work as lifeguards at a local pool.  They only have eyes for each other... and I won't go further than that.  Watch the movie, and see for yourselves!  Daria's spoiled brat sister Quinn and her `Fashion Club' gal pals get tutored due to low scores on their PSAT exams.  (How I remember my high school days!  I was a Junior when I took my PSAT exam - and passed it!)  Lead `Fashion Club' member Sandi (with the deep voice) reminds me so much of Khan from Mike Judge's \"King of the Hill\" series.  Like Khan, Sandi is often sullen-expressioned, and complains a lot!     Mack and Jodie also have their share of the `summertime blues'.  Mack takes a job as an ice-cream vendor, in a truck, and has to put up with bratty kids who aggravate him as they buy ice cream.  His girlfriend Jodie has her share of difficulties as she volunteers at an office, and is up to her neck in work.  The pair doesn't have time to date.      I love the opening 'beach' number with the `Daria' cast frolicking on the beach... and with Daria not participating, of course. It is reminiscent of the \"Beach Blanket\" 1960's movies with Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello. Jane, too, is seen isolated on another part of the beach, painting. Her isolation gives proof of her rift with Daria.  The song \"Turn the Sun Down\", sung by the female band Splendora (who provide the theme song for `Daria'), is playfully catchy! Splendora sounds like the female version of the Beach Boys. The 'beach' segment concludes with the sun going down at the beach at dusk, with the frolickers still dancing...followed, in a dissolve, by the \"Daria\" logo in a similar 'dusk' color, with the film's title; and Splendora's melodic singing as the song concludes. This is a nice effect.      Another nice effect is in the dvd's Main Menu, with a scene taken from the opening of the `Daria' t.v. series.  A somber Daria is at the movies.  Her fellow moviegoers, surrounding her, are laughing at the scenes from the opening `Beach' segment. \"Turn the Sun Down\" is played in the background.       At the film's end, there are `Outtakes', which are cute and amusing involving the `Daria' cast.  There are a few gross outtakes also included.    \"Is It Fall Yet?\" got me interested in the \"Daria\" t.v. series.  To admit, Daria looks much nicer in her own series than when she was on Beavis and Butt-Head\".  I purchased her \"Daria Diaries\" and \"Daria Databases\" books to help me get to know the Lawndale characters.  I'm presently reading her `Diaries'.  And I, too, hope that the complete \"Daria\" series gets released on dvd in the very near future.          But treat yourself to the interesting summer experiences -- as well as the summer fun -- at Lawndale with \"Is It Fall Yet?\"  And savor Daria's sweet smile at the near-conclusion of the opening sequence in the two bonus episodes.  A little girl in the film asks camp counselor Daria \"Do you ever smile??\"       The answer is Yes!  And this movie is sure to make you smile.

As someone who loved this wonderful series during the 50's and in sindication in later years - I still love it today - at age 51. As many have said - it seems that George Reeves was the one and only person to portray Superman. He had the charm,  charisma, the classic fine features, sense of humor, as well as very appealing vocal and acting qualities many actors today I'm sure - wish they had. And of course - that wonderful smile of his that few could resist. I have read that he was a very nice person to work with on the set and was always very sensitive and kind to others.  However - I'm not sure if everyone out there who loved him in the role knew how much he loved children and how much he did for them. I've heard and read many interviews about him and his portrayal of Superman and how he would devote many hours entertaining sick children in hospitals as the man of steel. Many children indeed - looked up to him as their own Superman and the great and wholesome role model he portrayed.  \"Around The World With Superman\" the last episode in the second season dvd, very nicely shows George's sensitivity and love for children as he tries to help a young blind girl regain her sight  and takes her on a once in a lifetime flight around the world - in his arms. When he first visits the girl in her mother's apartment as Clark Kent and as Superman - with the aid of the wonderful background music that made the 50's series so memorable  and enjoyable - one can clearly see George Reeve's love for children in his voice and the things he says to her and way he  looks at the young girl.   Indeed - a very touching and sensitive episode, and in my humble opinion - a very nice and memorable tribute to George.", "output": "POS", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1104.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given product reviews about dvds.

When it comes to the great classics of anime history, there are a few that stand out. Anime like Gundam and Macross, the genre known as Mecha. These shows are known for their drama, romance, intrigue, beautiful animation, classic musical scores, and giant humanoid robots who's pilots fight heroically against a seemingly unstoppable force of evil. Shoji Kawamori's classic Macross is really required viewing for anyone who enjoys Mecha sagas, delivering all the required elements in huge way. Shoji Kawamori is a genius, whose incredible robot designs have been used in many anime classics. Why do I mention this? Because in addition to Macross he created Escaflowne...     What is Escaflowne? It is quite frankly, the greatest television show I have ever seen in my life. It is the classic story of the hero with a thousand faces told from the perspective of the goddess/protector. It is a science-fiction fantasy epic set in a world that's a cross between Medieval Europe and the Asian/Middle Eastern regions. It is a story of an ordinary girl named Hitomi who travels to another world and finds herself its possible savior, her destiny intertwined with its heros. It is the story of small warring kingdoms that must unite in order to stop an evil Empire seemingly bent on nothing less than world conquest and destruction. It is the tale of a bold and chivalrous knight, a young king bent on revenge for the destruction of his kingdom, a cute cat-girl, princesses, merchants, villains with noble causes and villains who are monsters. And of course, the giant stone Mecha that could save the world...or perhaps destroy it...     If there exists such a thing in this universe as a perfectly balanced show, THIS is it. There is character development (like the perfect knight who has a hidden past, or the long-lost brother who works for the enemy but desperately wants to save his brother), an incredible plot (the lost people of Atlantis, an engine which can alter fate, and an evil emperor whos ultimate goal is to create a world-wide utopia of perfect happiness), super-cool technology (like the coolest Mecha I have ever seen ANYWHERE, the Guymelefs), heart-warming (or is it heart-wrenching?) romance (complete with love triangles that will keep you guessing), action sequences to die for (giant stone mechs fighting with broadswords!!! Invisible giant robots with liquid-metal tentacle weapons! Dragons!!!), and characters that are very deep indeed (Hitomi goes through an enormous transformation emotionally through the course of the story).     Although many people prefer Japanese to English in their anime, this show features one of the finest dubs in any anime you will ever watch, with great performances all-around. The standout though, is probably the voice of Folken [played to perfection by Paul Dobson] (the way he said some of the lines left me awestruck, and one scene had me ready to cry). The animation and art is also quite glorious, featuring a gorgeous watercolor style slightly reminiscent of Gundam Wing, but with better use of color and FAR more complex and beautiful backgrounds. I must say that the soundtrack of Escaflowne is one of the finest soundtracks to anything ever crafted. I currently have 3 CDs of the music (and I plan to buy the others one day), and I listen to it A LOT. Yoko Kanno's score for this anime could best be likened to some of John William's best (as it has hints of John Williams' influence through the use of horns to denote action and strings to show emotion, as well as choral chants for key moments). Take the piece \"Dance of Curse\" for instance. It reminds one a lot of \"Duel of the Fates\", but it came out first, and personally I think it's better. Played only twice during the entire show, it's one of the most thrilling pieces of music ever crafted. And I havne't even mentioned the awesome opening song or the INCREDIBLE theme that ends the last episode. In the end, Escaflowne completely transcends its genre to become a true classic. It's directed as well (or better) than the best movies of Hollywood history (using dramatic angles and the like), and doubtless fans will be eager to return to its world again and again. One of the few negative points I can think of for this series are that the main character and the cat-girl Merle can be a little annoying at times (especially toward the beginning of the series). But by the end of the series, I don't think there was a single character that I didn't love. I also really hate the song that plays at the end of every episode \"mystic eyes\". It doesn't go with the whole theme of the series, and after a few listens it really started to grate on my ears.     Believe it or not, for all its glorious ideas and execution, this show also has NO FILLER! Originally, it was to be a 36 episode show like Macross. So when it was cut down to 26 episodes, the filler had to go or there would be no time for the huge story that's told. And ultimately, it's the story that matters most. As I watched this show for the first time I found myself addicted to its world, in love with its characters, awestruck with it's beauty, and enraptured with its music. The ideas though, were what made me decide this is the greatest TV show I have ever seen. In this show you will see fate altered, armies nuked, people who are half animal, creatures that can shape-shift, and even an incredible sequence where Hitomi travels into the mind of a character to stop his journey into death and bring him back to the mortal realm. When I had finished Escaflowne my mind was full of questions. What if people and events were attracted to each other and fate was something you could measure and manipulate? Does the pursuit of a perfect world justify any means? And what of the Escaflowne Guymelef? Why was it built? Just how powerful could it ultimately become? To this day I am fascinated by the transformation that Van goes through, and I keep asking myself if the Escalfowne itself was a living thing capable of turning its master to evil. Maybe someday I'll know. Until then I'll have to satisfy myself with...Escaflowne.", "output": "POS", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1104.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given product reviews about dvds.

Bully featured mundane acting, the most UNLIKABLE characters  ever to put on screen, stupid characters, a \"twist\" that  aint really a twist, awful camera shots and angle and  a \"gay bull\". Nuff said.    *Teenage Caveman-Subpar sci-film.    Now we get to Ken Park, probably the most revolting   story of Clark's kids trilogy if you will.    These kids special? Please give me a break. I don't  call killing your neighbors or grandparents, special.    Doing drugs makes you special? Funny I thought that made  you a druggie and a loser.    There is no smoothness or observation or anaylsis of  the kids from any sort of rhetorical view. Anyone who  who seeks to compare this to classic shows like Family  Ties, or My So Called Life isn't fooling anyone.    One key difference, the kids in so called life, knew they  were troubled, lost and asked for help. The teens in \"Ken Park\"  could give a crap if they live or die, their days are spent  on drug binges, fornicating with the friends and in some  cases, their friend's mother.      Really it doesn't get anymore revoling that Larry Clark.    None of the characters in the movie can be considered,  weak, inept, pathetic, loony comes to mind but far  from being strong.    Softcore and hardcore pornograpy seem to be what the filmmaking  is echoing nothing else, the other reviews even the most  positive ones can ignore that.    There is no reality with these kids, they live in their  violent world and heaven forbid if you try to take them  out of it.    Clark is not anybody's master of art, if you're art is  hardcore pornography, mixed in with convulted storyline  , with no rolemodels, no point and weak characters then  people need to pick up a dictionary or read actual  definitions of art.    The movie is nothing more than tour de force of obscene garbage  that should be flushed down the toilet.

I don't know how familiar I can say I am with Krzystof Kieslowski. I've seen 2/3 of \"The Decalogue\" his ten-hour masterpiece and now I've seen the first film in his three colors trilogy \"Blue.\" I think anyone who sees a film by Kieslowski will have a hard time disputing that he was one of the great directors. He's not credited as being one of the great directors, but he is credited as being a great director. Hopefully, in the years to come, his brilliance will become acknowledged. \"Blue\" is a strange film...It doesn't follow the typical rules of storytelling. It has a plot, but the images it uses play as big a part in telling the story as the plot does. Then there's the music. Rarely has the music been as important to a film as it is to \"Blue.\" Juliette Binoche (who won a French Oscar for Best Actress for this role) plays Julie, a young woman whose husband and young daughter are killed in a car accident. Julie was in the car, but made it out alive. Once she heals up, she finds herself being badgered by friends and composers for her husband's last composition (her husband was a famous composer). The movie's turning point comes when Julie calls an old friend that she knows is in love with her. After they do their thing, she moves into an anonymous little apartment building in the hopes of escaping everyone she knows. She fears being hurt again and decides to have no friends, no acquaintances, and no family. Then, in a Kieslowski-like turn of events, she meets her husband's pregnant mistress. There are a lot of movies about people losing loved ones and trying to deal with it. In Kieslowski's hands, however, this formula seems fresh and new. There's no denying that Kieslowski and his co-writer Krzystof Piesiewicz understood the human condition and humans in general. None of the scenes in the film feel artificial or unneeded. Kieslowski doesn't waste time filling the screen with pointless scenes, but has it shaved down to the essentials. As I said, this film is very different. Unique would sum it up quite good. While I'd be lying if I said I understood the significance of this, there is something he does in the movie that I was quite fond of. In certain scenes, while Julie is talking usually, loud music will begin playing and the screen will fade to black. After a few moments, we fade back into exactly where we were. While I haven't seen the other films in the trilogy quite yet, I'm looking forward to them. Any fan of foreign cinema should see this film...If you haven't yet discovered Kieslowski, you need to.

This was one of those mythological films that I speak so highly of in other reviews. This was a gem hidden in the darkness. Looking at the cover, you would never guess that this would be such a powerhouse of a film, but let me be the first to say that it was.     Berenger and Winger are amazing in their roles.  Winger giving the best performance that I have ever seen her do, while Berenger takes a character riddled with evil and makes him human.  When I first began this film, I was expecting a very true Hollywood production.  One that would be dark at first, but all of the sudden create this happy world at the end.  This film did nothing close to that.  What was amazing about this film was that it let the audience make it's own decisions.  Not much was handed to you on a silver platter.      Upon the first ten minutes of this film, you would probably assume that it was a love story. It is anything BUT a love story.  It is a crime/thriller/drama film, and quite possibly one of the strongest that I have seen in some time.  There are some scenes in this film that I couldn't believe I was watching.  The sheer brilliance of the director left me wondering if this film was really made in 1988.  The cinematography was outstanding.  There is one scene that stands out the most in my mind.  After Berenger tries to \"put down\" his dying horse, he can't pull himself to shoot a living creature, so he has his side-kick do it. After it is done, he runs out into the rain behind Berenger wrapped in a plastic tarp. The image here is of the devil riding close behind.  It is so vivid and so beautifully done that you can't help to wonder what that may represent.  There are a couple of scenes very similar to this as well.     Now, this isn't a film without some small flaws.  The young girl was annoying. Perhaps I find young children in these types of films always to be annoying, but in this case it was especially bad.  Also, there were some dopey scenes to this film. There were some parts that I felt I was the director of the film watching some bad lines happen between Berenger and Winger ... but it was only a couple.     Betrayed ends like an open-ended question.  It tells you that justice has been served, but not eliminated.  It does not paint a pretty picture of our society. Be prepared if you see this for some embarrassing, yet disturbing images of ethnic hatred in this film.  Some scenes that you will not believe ever happens in our country, but in the back of your mind you know certain evils do exist.  But then also be prepared to see John Mahoney (of Say Anything... fame) do his best work ever.  The war took his son, the bank took his land, why shouldn't he fight in this battle of supremacy?

Alyssa Milano's mother (who is also her manager) has made a crusade of tracking down nudie pics of her daughter on the internet.  She's denounced such websites' \"exploitation\" on national TV, and has even developed a side business as a cybercop, lending her web-busting skills to other stars.  Milano's mother/manager could have saved herself the trouble had she instead steered her daughter away from doing this film.    Embrace of the Vampire is softcore horror porn, and the source for many of those Milano skin pics.  After TV's Who's the Boss was canceled (but before Charmed returned Milano to star status) Milano was just another unemployed former child actress, so maybe this porn film seemed like a good career move at the time.     Milano has stated in interviews that she wanted to demonstrate that she was not the goody-two-shoes girl she'd played in Who's the Boss.  In other words, she wanted to \"grow\" as an actress.  So she did Embrace of the Vampire, in which she goes topless in several scenes, engages in a lesbian romp with Charlotte Lewis, and participates in orgies with characters tonguing various parts of her nude body.    Mission accomplished.    Actually, Embrace of the Vampire uses Milano's virginal image from Who's the Boss by casting her as ... a virgin.  A virgin whose boobs are straining against her too-tight blouse and who undresses before her boyfriend (albeit asking him not to look), but still, a virgin.  A virgin who dreams of orgies and fondles lesbians and doesn't know why.    Here's why: Milano is the reincarnation of Martin Kemp's true love.  Some 300 years ago, a pack of scantily clad vampresses turned Kemp into a vampire during a blood orgy.  Now that he's rediscovered Milano, he has three nights to rekindle her love for him.  If so, they will live forever as vampires.  If not, he dies and loses her forever.    Why the sudden three-night deadline?  Why not.    The plot and motivations are paper thin, as is typical of porn.  Milano wanders around campus, wondering why she's having so many sexual dreams, even daydreams.  Her boyfriend wanders about, wondering if she's so pure.  Kemp wanders about, seen by Milano but often not by others.  Lewis wanders about for some bisexual action.  Other collegiates wander about their parties and campus back alleys for some hetero action.  Amid all this wandering there's much carnal action, and more carnal dreaming.  Occasionally, Kemp kills someone for dissing Milano.  John Stanley (in his Creature Features movie guide) correctly refers to it as a \"meandering, almost formless script.\"    Kemp has the best lines.  Like many vampires, he agonizes and suffers a hyper-romantic vampire angst over a lost love.  His appearance is a touch effeminate (too much eyeliner), but it lends an appropriate sinister element to his character.  He is part romantic vampire, part bloodthirsty beast.  Lewis's small part is pointless to the \"story.\"  All that's required is that she undress, and when she does, it was worth the wait.  Rachel True (The Craft) has an even smaller role, the fate of all the characters who keep their clothes on.    All of the above three are more interesting, more charismatic, than Milano or her boyfriend.  At film's end, Kemp's tearful bloodthirsty angst, and Milano's tearful rediscovery of her love, the \"tragic\" star-crossed ending, and the Christian iconography, all mirror Coppola's Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992).  One senses that director Goursaud was trying to rise above her porn material.    However, this is no poor woman's Bram Stoker's Dracula.  Milano is no Winona Ryder and Kemp is no Gary Oldman.  For that matter, none of the other talent on this film compare to their counterparts.  And the budget just isn't there.  The strength of low-budget horror is a gritty authenticity, which this film tries to hide rather than utilize.    How low was the budget?  Listen, I was an extra on both Bram Stoker's Dracula and Embrace of the Vampire.  (In both instances, I kept my clothes on.)    I worked one day on Embrace of the Vampire.  Don't look for me, I ended up on the cutting room floor, and extras are rarely mentioned in credits.  But let me tell you an \"inside story\" on the making of this film:    We were shooting in a nightclub on the Sunset Strip.  The extras were divided into three camps: union, nonunion, and Modesto extras.  Union extras earn the most, especially once overtime kicks in, so they were wrapped after eight hours (they were only hired in the first place to fill a union quota).  This was during my nonunion days (I'm in SAG now), so I put in a full 14 hours, after which we were paid in cash and wrapped.  The Modesto extras were still working when we left.    Now what, you may ask, is a Modesto extra?  I also wondered, and so I asked one.  I was told they were from an acting class in Modesto, California.  They had been bussed in to work on the film as part of a \"class assignment.\"  In other words, they were PAYING to come to work.    There's not a whole lot to learn about being an extra.  It's neither glamourous nor difficult.  And nonunion extra jobs for twentysomethings are VERY EASY to come by.  The lampposts in Los Angeles are covered with flyers seeking cattle, ehr, extras.  I did it for the cash, and because if you do it often enough, you increase your chances of getting into the union (which I did, after some 13 grueling months).    NEVER PAY for the \"chance\" to be an extra, not in Los Angeles.  I made the mistake of volunteering to be an extra a few times, but wised up after a few months.  My guess is the producers of Embrace of the Vampire paid this acting teacher to bus down some cattle, and far less than even nonunion extras cost.  I know this teacher was getting paid by the students, and that they were not getting paid to be on the film.    Another inside story: Someone stole a silver pin belonging to a crew member.  She was near tears because it had sentimental value.  Never leave anything of value lying around on a set.    And some trivia: John Stanley says this film was \"originally conceived as The Nosferatu Diaries,\" but on the set, we were told the working title was The Collector.    Embrace of the Vampire is a decent time-killer ... barely.  If you're looking for horror, there are hundreds of better films.  Dozens of better vampire films.  Even many superior erotic vampire films -- Vampyres (British, 1975) comes to mind.

It is the story of infatuation, jealousy, deception, grief, murder, and true love lost forever. The film tells of an unattainable beautiful courtesan named Garance (unforgettably played by Arletty who was over 40 and seemed not to care at all if she looked her age) and four men who love her - the famous mime Baptist (Jean-Louis Barrault is matchless), the actor, Frederick LeMaitre, the criminal Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Lacenaire, and the aristocrat Comte de Montray. She loved one of them and the affair was doomed. The film is so much more than just a romantic story (which is absolutely beautiful and compelling) - it is a love song to the Art of Theater where art imitates life and vice-versa and the hidden symbolism of freedom and despotism (the film was made in Paris during the Nazi Occupation under immensely difficult circumstances).     Jacques Prevert wrote the brilliant and ironic scenario and dialog; Marcel Carne superbly directed the film.

How do you separate a socially important film from a great film? Sure this film tackled the AIDS/homosexuality issue head-on but that doesn't automatically make it a great film. I'm not knocking this film, of course not. But there's a lot of parts in it that I didn't like which maybe made it appear to be a lesser film than what it wants to be, it is or what everyone makes it out to be.    Andrew Beckett works for a prestigious law firm working on a big account. His health declines a little bit nothing overly serious until he's fired for apparently botching the case. Turns out not only is he a homosexual but he has AIDS so he figures that's why he was fired. He needs representation so he hires Joe Miller, a top and famous attorney who is, rather bluntly, very intolerant of gays. So they form an unlikely duo to battle a top firm while dealing with gay bashers to closet gays.    One small nitpick: it seemed like anyone that is in Andy's family or friends circle is against him. There was not a lot of normal everyman citizens who supported him. A similar problem in Brokeback Mountain where any scene with the 2 men was gorgeously shot while them with their wives looked rather bland and desolate looking, complete with sad looking wives. It's nothing that derails the film though. And I don't know why but I never liked Jonathan Demme's trademark of looking in the camera. It works for Silence of the Lambs but here it looks...weird, and maybe a bit too on the nose.    Now Tom Hanks did win the award for Best Actor but honestly it should've went to Denzel Washington who manages to be visibly struggling with his less-than-enthusiastic view on gays and the changing perspectives dealing with the case. Hanks, in a way, reminds me of Charlize Theron who put on ugly makeup for Monster. Losing a crapload of weight does not automatically give you an Oscar. No knock against Hanks but it seems funny it went to him instead of Washington.    Is it a watchable film? Of course, it's quite good and performances are excellent.

When Hollywood decided that the classic Christmas cartoon How the Grinch Stole Christmas needed updating, I experienced a quaver of fear. How, I wondered, could anyone bring the classic Dr. Seuss tale and its gnarly green villain to life as vividly as the 1966 animation?    I can give a mixed report. Jim Carrey, in the title role, does a marvelous job recreating the nasty antithesis of Yuletide joy. His actions and facial contortions are near-perfect (although his voice, I must admit, pales in comparison to the cartoon version's Boris Karloff). He dominates the entire film with energy and antics only slightly overshadowed by his prodigious makeup and costume. Anthony Hopkins also did good work as the narrator.    But director Ron Howard didn't do the Seuss story complete justice. Instead of reimagining the original through a new lens, he gave us a completely different story. The Whos of Who-ville are the primary victims here -- where once they were beatific inhabitants of a remote and pastoral village, they've become greedy, materialistic, hard-partying gluttons in a town based solely on marketing and capitalism.    Cindy Lou Who, the innocent tot who discovers the Grinch at his nefarious thievery, is now an older child (Taylor Momsen) bent on redeeming the famous hermit, who boldly braves his mountain fastness to spread her version of holiday cheer. Even the Grinch's pseudo-Santa sleigh has been reinvented, now boasting rocket boosters. And the new back-story, which attempts to explain the Grinch's Christmas loathing, doesn't make a lot of sense. While the cartoon gave us a villain who was evil, rotten to his core and filled with inexplicable rage at the world, this Grinch is simply misunderstood and overly mischievous. Also, should the Grinch's big redemption scene really involve so much heart-thumping pain?    I feel sorry for the children who will grow up associating this movie with Dr. Seuss' marvelous story, rather than the animated feature which still holds up so well after 35 years. A favorite Christmas tradition has been replaced with typical Hollywood glitz and glitter, and the season is poorer for it. Please, if you have children (or a childlike fascination for Christmas), stick with the original.    by Tom Knapp, Rambles edito", "output": "NEG", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1104.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given product reviews about dvds.

Then the camera pans in close for a \"waist up\" scene and Bathsheba and her female helper are washing her breasts and body.   This is diffinetly an R-rated scene. This movie is not biblically accurate as others have claimed. People need to read their bibles before making such a claim. There are many scenes that are accurate, but there are many that are not. One example is that in the movie Bathsheba wouldn't sleep with David while her husband was alive. Not true in scipture. In the bible, David saw her, had her called to the palace and slept with her.

Yes, there is eye-candy in a soft porn kind of way, but not in the way of real cinematography (very crude camera blocking) or production design (the hospital set is awful and as for the rest, they're ok but too few). And it's just too badly written. There's some bad acting too, but that doesn't really hurt this kind of movies.   The second episode is less soft porn and more fantasy and plot-driven, but having to play every scene in the one same street and two or three poorly dressed sets, makes the characters eternally go back and forth between them, which gets tiresome pretty quick and also doesn't allow for really fluid plot development. Also fx or action scenes are sorely lacking. This could be secondary if the script were any good but there is no logic or clear rules in the universe they're creating and it ends up a mess.

For all the dirt and aggravation of working on the chicken farm he gets paid $1 an hour. Now who can't think of other people in our country who have to deal with that in a real-life scenario?

Is that THE ROCK who is in this movie looking malnourished with the rotted teeth and sinister contact lenses make-up? This movie is horrible. But, it is typical for a Van Damme flick. Horrible acting, over-produced with that cheesy waxy feel to it, non-existent storyline and the usual idiotic ending. I have to admit though, that I have most of Van Damme's movies. He is a decent Martial Artist. In my opinion his best movies are \"Kickboxer\" and \"Bloodsport\". These are his only movies that are actually enjoyable to watch and somewhat inspiring. I have a few observations / comments / questions to make that should be humorous for the seasoned Van Damme fan: Isn't it funny that with all his millions of dollars that Van Damme can't find a plastic surgeon who can hide that silly bump on his forehead... Why must every character Van Damme plays speak with a French accent? He tries to play a wide variety of different action hero roles but always the character must in some way originate from France. Isn't this preposterous? You'd think if Van Damme was serious about his \"acting\" career he would have attempted to remedy this flaw. I mean, it's not like his acting roles are all that challenging but it would be nice if he was even partially believable in his roles... Why does Van Damme always have to show his bare rear-end so much? Does he think WOMEN are watching his silly movies? You'd think someone would realize that mostly men watch action films and the majority of men have no desire to see his naked backside so WHY SHOW IT? ... Is it me or does Van Damme need a good hair stylist? His hair is especially stupid in CYBORG. He looks like he should be in the cast for \"Revenge of the Nerds\"... Speaking of style, was it Van Damme himself who invented that stupid tucked in shirt with pleated Dockers pulled up way too high over the waist with a snazzy belt 80's look? If so, for this deed alone he should be reprimanded... Why was Van Damme such a huge action hero? He is so friggin' short that if you saw him in line behind you at a convenience store I don't think he would look all that intimidating. At least Steven Seagal is tall and tough looking although Van Damme is definitely in better shape. You never see Seagal showing his muscles.... Lastly, even though I can laugh about Van Damme I am definitely a fan. That being said, I wonder if any of his other fans share my sentiments about the producers, directors and just about everyone else involved with most of his many films. I think they should be ashamed of the way they have done their work. Van Damme has alot of heart, maybe not so much as Stallone, but more heart than most action heroes like Shwarzenegger, etc. The people involved with most of Van Damme films have truly done a disservice to him and to action film fans everywhere. They should have taken pride in their work.

Third, the specific story of the teenager drove home the importance of having smaller classes in high school. I have 35 kids in each class. I know that for some, that is small. I have 6 classes. It is impossible for teachers, most of us wish we could, to be able to cater to the needs of each individual student. The video showed the importance of not only giving a correct diagnosis for a students problems, but the importance of following through and working with the student, so he or she can really succeed. The real stories showed the emotion that not only the students go through, but the families as well. It is a firm reminder that children need understanding, not labels.

These 3 movies are indeed landmark movies in Chinese Cinema and definetly for Jet li and Movie Kung fu.    However, I watched 10 minutes of te first movie on this compilation which DOESN'T have english Subs ( I don't mind, but every other DVD I have ever seen has this )    Also, in the first ten minutes, there have been 2 incredibly bad awkward translations. For some reason, Cousin Yi is now Aunt 13 and Chu's bird is now Chu's Beard. This is Crap. Do NOT buy this, buy the movies seperately, you can probably find them each for 9 bucks, and they would be more satisfying that way", "output": "NEG", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1104.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given product reviews about dvds.

I ordered this DVD when it first came out and I've been enjoying it ever since. All the performances are enjoyable- some more than others, but they are all wonderful nonetheless. Some of my pesonal favorites include:      Patti Lupone bringing down the house along with Mandy Patinkin and Bob Gunton doing the song \"A New Argentina\" from Evita. This is definately one of my top 5 favorites on this DVD.      Anegela Lansbury providing a hilarious performance in \"The worst Pies in London\" from Sweeny Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street      Carol Channing singing the nothing-less-than inspirational \"Before the Parade Passes By\" from Hello, Dolly!      Yul Brynner performing \"Shall We Dance?\" with his co-star (not sure of her name). This performance is priceless and so is that dress!      John Raitt's beautiful baritone voice soars in this song-\"Hey There\" from The Pajama Game      Paul Lynde delivers a ton of laughs in \"Kids\" from Bye Bye Birdie      Joel Grey and cast perform the spectacle that is Cabaret in the song \"Willkommen\". This song never gets out of your head!      Gwen Verdon and Chita Rivera- two of Broadway's top leading ladies come together and perform two wonderful songs from Chicago: \"All That Jazz\" and \"Nowadays\". Bob Fosse's coreography can never get old and is dispalyed in this performance for your full enjoyment.      Jerry Orbach. His death was a tragic loss to the theater. That's why these DVD's are so remarkable. This is another top performance- the song \"Lullaby of Broadway\" from 42nd Street. It was this performance that inspired me to save up and go to NYC to see my very first broadway show- 42nd Street.      Andrea McArdle and the orphans perform \"Tomorrow\" and \"You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile\" from Annie. This is just superb. There's absolutely no flaws.      Betty Buckley and cast perform two songs from Cats-\"Jellicle Songs\" and the classic \"Memory\". It is stunning to watch.      Any performance with Patti LuPone in it is a gem in itself. This one- \"Buenos Aires\" from Evita shows off her powerful set of pipes and shows the other side of the character of Eva Peron.      Bonnie Franklin and cast are hilarious in the song  \"Applause\" from the show Applause. The whole theme to the song is 100% true and kind of \"hits home\" for every actor. Plus, it has parodies of other classic musicals that will have you rolling on the floor in laughter if you're a big fan of musicals.      All in all, this DVD is totally worth buying! And after you're through with this one and have memorized all the songs, check out Broadway's Lost Treasures II. I have yet to receive III, but I am looking forward to it!", "output": "POS", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1104.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given product reviews about dvds.

The Blu-ray Disc is supposed to have 5 times more memory than standard DVD. So why can't they release ALL the special features (and more if possible) that the standard DVD has? I don't know if it's a product, copyright, or money issue, but this hasn't yet happened on HD DVD. The standard DVD of this movie has full-length audio commentary, 15 minutes of extended fight sequences with optional commentary, a behind-the-scenes documentary, a storyboard-to-film comparison, and a sneak peek at the Making Of the second \"Transporter.\" None of that is on this Blu-ray. So if you're a real movie buff and like special features, get the Standard DVD of this movie", "output": "NEG", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1104.json"}]
