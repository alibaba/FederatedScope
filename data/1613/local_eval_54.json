He  searched out  Cline 's address online  recognizing it as the location of  his  mother's former doctor. Then  he  Googled the doctor's name. When a photo popped up   he  was stunned:  He  looked like  Cline .\n\"It was just too similar to be coincidental \"  he  says. White had long known  he  was a donor baby  but that day   he  had an eerie feeling  he  was staring at the man who was likely  his  biological father.\nAround the same time  Julie Harmon saw a TV news story about  Cline . She'd discovered years earlier that her blood type indicated she was not the child of both her parents. She didn't follow up to find out why  but the report about  Cline   her mother's fertility doctor  was unnerving.\nThe TV story featured Jacoba Ballard  whose mother had also gone to  Cline  and whose complaint to the state helped launched an investigation. Harmon contacted Ballard through Facebook  and they traded photos. There were striking similarities.\nThese two women and White recently crowded into an Indianapolis courtroom to hear  Cline  receive a one-year suspended sentence for lying to investigators when  he  denied wrongdoing; DNA tests determined  he  is the biological father of Ballard and another woman whose mother was  his  patient.  Cline  apologized \"for the pain my actions have caused\" but didn't specify how often  he  used  his  own sperm in procedures \u00e2 court documents say  he  told Ballard about 50 times.\n Cline 's sentencing  though  was not the end of this story. Instead  in an extraordinary epilogue  three one-time strangers \u00e2 White  Harmon and Ballard \u00e2 have forged a kinship as brother and sisters  even as they wrestle with the revelation about their identities. They've also reached out to 21 other men and women  all in their 30s  who've been identified through DNA tests as half-siblings \u00e2 evidence  they say  that  Cline  is likely their father  as well. About a half-dozen of them live in central Indiana.\nMany stay in touch through a private Facebook page  and several gathered last fall for a cookout with their spouses  children and three mothers who'd been  Cline  patients. Others have gone on social outings  shared childhood photos  taken note of similarities (most of the men are over 6 feet tall) and  at times  confided in one another private details of their lives.\nJacoba Ballard was angry when she sat in court in December  describing a three-year ordeal that determined  Cline  is her biological father.\nBallard  37  says  Cline  told  her  mother  he  used donor sperm from medical residents.  She 'd known since  she  was 10 that  she  was a donor child  but in 2014  Ballard grew curious about  her  family history and thought  she  might be able to track down some brothers and sisters.  She  took a DNA test from 23andMe.com  a biotech company that uses saliva samples to determine ancestry and identify distant and close relatives  health risks and physical traits.\nClients can choose whether to be identified in a \"DNA relatives tool\" that connects them to others. When Ballard's results came back  they listed seven half-siblings  all but one identified by name. Ballard and two others got together  assembled a family tree and realized one common thread: Their mothers had gone to  Cline  for fertility treatments.\nBallard and a half-sister arranged to meet with two of  Cline 's adult children. At first   she  says  they denied their father had been a donor  then said he'd done so in a small number of cases. About a month later  Ballard and a group of the half-siblings met with  Cline  himself  and  she  says he told conflicting stories  finally saying he'd donated sperm about 50 times to help unknowing patients who desperately wanted children.\nWhen Ballard filed a complaint with the Indiana attorney general's office   Cline  responded in a letter that anyone accusing him of being a donor \"was guilty of slander and/or libel.\" At his sentencing  he acknowledged using his sperm. \"I was foolish in my actions  and I should not have lied \" he said.\nBallard's DNA match to  Cline  was 99.9997  court records show.\nThe case wasn't the first of its kind. In Virginia  Dr. Cecil Jacobson was convicted in 1992 of fraud and perjury for using his sperm to impregnate patients without telling them.  Cline  was convicted of obstruction of justice for lying to investigators  but a measure pushed by Ballard and others was introduced in the Indiana Senate this year to make it a crime for doctors to treat patients for infertility by using their own sperm or egg without consent. The measure didn't receive a hearing  so it's dead for this session; its sponsor has not yet decided if he'll reintroduce it.\nIf there is any comfort   she  says  it's in the camaraderie that's developed among several half-siblings. They've gotten together for concerts  an occasional softball game for one of their kids and a few Christmas celebrations. White and Harmon attended the high school graduation ceremonies of Ballard's two children  and the two women speak every day. They laugh about their similar tastes; they even prefer the same order at McDonald's \u00e2 no onions.\n\"I went from not having a care to wanting to know everything \" says the 34-year-old White. He tracked down a medical school graduation photo of  Cline  and studied photos of Cline's son online  noticing similar facial traits \u00e2 a round face and high forehead.", "output": "Fertility doctor's secret reveals discovery of at least 23 half", "category": "Title Generation 1046.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, generate a short title of the document.

I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t notice he was gone. I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t conscious of any reality but Titanic  even though I already knew exactly what was going to happen. One of my friends had briefed me on what to expect:  Jack  and Rose fall in love  the ship sinks  and  Jack  finds a piece of wreckage floating in the sea and helps Rose clamber onto it  saving her from the freezing death that claims him before the lifeboats return for survivors. But it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair  my friend explained: It was obvious to her that there was room for them both. It didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter that I knew exactly what was coming. I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think about anything else while the movie played. And even when the lights came up and I realized my father was missing  his absence didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to matter much. I was 9  but I already understood he had a habit of wandering off when he got bored. I was even used to it. What was new was this feeling: that I had to get back to Titanic as soon as possible. The credits were barely rolling as I began to strategize my next viewing. I knew that the movie had completely devastated me  and I knew that all I wanted was to be devastated again. But why? Viewers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 many of them adolescent and preadolescent girls like me \u00e2\u0080\u0094 would go back to Titanic over and over again while it was in theaters. It was the No. 1 movie in the US for 15 consecutive weeks  a feat that has yet to be surpassed  and likely never will be. Well before it was released  James Cameron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s passion project became notorious as the most expensive movie ever made  with a final budget of $200 million. Then it became the first movie in history to earn $1 billion at the box office. And it achieved this success despite months of advance press claiming that the movie was all but doomed; despite the widespread belief that James Cameron  who previously helmed the Alien and Terminator franchises  had no business trying to tell a story about love; and despite the fact that Titanic  in a way that is now all too easy to forget  is an immensely difficult movie to watch. When Titanic was released on video in September 1998  its 3 hours and 14 minutes had to be split across two VHS tapes. The same studio heads who were convinced Titanic could only recoup its budget at best (success was almost mathematically impossible) had seen its gargantuan runtime as just one of its many liabilities. Critics also pointed to its ungainly length as proof of its failure to play by the rules: It was a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbloated leviathan \u00e2\u0080\u009d a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbehemoth \u00e2\u0080\u009d and a tiresome epic that  according to the Washington Post\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Desson Howe  left viewers \u00e2\u0080\u009cthinking the unpardonable thought: \u00e2\u0080\u0098OK  sink already.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s length was also bad news for movie theaters  since it meant they had to schedule fewer showings \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and sell fewer tickets \u00e2\u0080\u0094 than they could with a normal movie. After screening Titanic for a test audience in Minneapolis  however  executives at Paramount and Fox  which had jointly financed the production  began wondering if  Cameron \u00e2\u0080\u0099s folly might not be a disaster of Waterworld proportions. The audience laughed and cheered and gasped at all the right moments  and gave the movie and its characters astoundingly high ratings on the survey cards they filled out after the showing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt went well \u00e2\u0080\u009d a Fox executive said cagily. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot great  but well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When all was said and done  Titanic had cost a little over $1 million per minute of screentime  and it was sometimes hard for studio executives to look at the movie  Cameron  described as a way to honor the disaster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s victims without wondering just how much this history lesson would end up costing them.  Cameron  had been dreaming of Titanic since Robert Ballard located the ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remains in 1985 (\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be goddamned!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ballard exclaimed as Titanic loomed into view  a line  Cameron  later borrowed for  his  own characters). After watching National Geographic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s special on Ballard in 1987   Cameron  made a few notes: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo story with bookends of present-day [wreckage] scene...intercut with memory of a survivor...needs a mystery or driving plot element.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Cameron  had always loved diving and deep-sea exploration  and The Abyss   his  third film as director and sole writer  had been a love letter to both. But that was fantasy; Titanic was real. And when  Cameron  first decided to pursue the project  the prospect of going to the wreck of Titanic might have been incentive enough to pitch the movie. When  he  first met with 20th Century Fox Chairman Peter Chernin to discuss Titanic  in the spring of 1995   he  asked for $2 million to fund a deep-sea expedition. It was an amazing sum of money to the Russian scientists and submersible pilots who took  Cameron  to the wreck. It was nothing compared to Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s final price tag. When Titanic opened in theaters across the US  on the weekend of Dec. 19  1997  it became the No. 1 movie in America by the skin of its teeth  edging out the latest James Bond movie  Tomorrow Never Dies  by a margin of $3.5 million. But to the executives who had nervously overseen Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s production \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and watched its budget nearly double  from $110 to $200 million \u00e2\u0080\u0094 this wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t particularly encouraging news. For Titanic to earn a profit  executives calculated  it would have to attract viewers in utterly unprecedented numbers: Even if it sold more tickets than Dances With Wolves  the most profitable three-hour-long movie ever released  Fox would still be $70 million in the red. And to be a success? It would have to somehow repeat its $28 million opening-weekend ticket sales \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and stay the No. 1 movie in America \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for weeks and weeks in a row  in a way no movie had in nearly a decade. It would have to be more than just a movie. It would have to become a cultural obsession. And it did.  Cameron  had once \u00e2\u0080\u0094 optimistically  as the final budget reflected \u00e2\u0080\u0094 called Titanic \"a $190 million chick flick.\" By Jan. 31  1998  20th Century Fox estimated that 7% of all American teenage girls had seen the movie twice. They weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the only ones going back to see Titanic a second time  and perhaps a third  though they did receive the most press. In 1997  the average return viewer rate for a theatrically released movie was 2%. Meanwhile  Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s was 20%. In February 1998  a survey found that 76% of Titanic's repeat viewers still planned to see it again. It made more money \u00e2\u0080\u0094 $32 million \u00e2\u0080\u0094 during its 11th weekend in theaters than it did during its first. (It helped that this weekend also happened to fall on Valentine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Day.) Theaters that previously worried about losing money on a movie they could screen only two or three times a day started squeezing in showings as early as 8 a.m. and as late as midnight  letting out satisfied viewers at 3:30 in the morning. Adults  people with families  responsibilities  and jobs  flocked to see Titanic. Because for a little while \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for 3 hours and 14 minutes  to be precise \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the rest of their lives disappeared. Titanic gave people a way to make the rest of their lives disappear  and so they kept coming back  and finding that the world  James Cameron  had created for them still felt just as real as it had the first time. What made Titanic not just a movie  but a destination? And what did it take to will such a world into solid reality?\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is the night before shooting starts \u00e2\u0080\u009d Kate Winslet wrote in her diary on Sept. 15  1996  \u00e2\u0080\u009cand here I am  all pin-curled up and hungry  ready to go. Thinking about Rose. She was so young. I need to think about her childhood  her youth  and find my way through the 17 years of her life. I'll never sleep tonight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The next morning  Winslet added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo sleep. This is it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 My life is not my own and probably never will be \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and that's Rose talking.\u00e2\u0080\u009d During Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seven months of production  the line between Kate and Rose would sometimes blur \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but it had been that way from the beginning. After she auditioned for the part  and  Cameron  left her waiting as  he  deliberated casting  Winslet tracked  him  down on  his  car phone  reaching  him  when  he  was on the freeway. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand \u00e2\u0080\u009d she told  him . \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am Rose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And she was. Kate Winslet was 20 when she began filming Titanic  and spent her 21st birthday shooting  Jack \u00e2\u0080\u0099s death scene. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe were lying there on the raft  sort of shivering together \u00e2\u0080\u009d she told Rosie O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Donnell while promoting the movie  \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I said \u00e2\u0080\u0098Leo  it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my birthday today.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And he said  \u00e2\u0080\u0098That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great  sweetie.

In the same Rosie appearance  Winslet said she and Leo had been \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe naughty children on the set \u00e2\u0080\u009d and remembered how  while filming the scenes where  Jack  and Rose waited for the lifeboats to return after the ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sinking  \u00e2\u0080\u009cLeo would sometimes say to me  \u00e2\u0080\u0098Sweetie  sweetie  I gotta pee.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d go  \u00e2\u0080\u0098So have I.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d They would pee in shifts  taking turns swimming over to another part of the tank \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which was about the most romantic gesture anyone could get either of them to recall from Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s set  though people tried. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gorgeous \u00e2\u0080\u009d Kate Winslet told Vanity Fair  around the time Leomania became a bona fide pandemic. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd to me  he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just smelly  farty Leo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t called on to talk about his sex appeal  Winslet sang DiCaprio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s praises as an artist. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gifted from God  as far as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m concerned \u00e2\u0080\u009d she told O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Donnell. In another interview  she mused  \u00e2\u0080\u009cLeo is such a brilliant actor. And he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know it. He really doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHe had started his career with commercials for Kraft cheese (\u00e2\u0080\u009cHands off  the Free Singles are for Daddy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAw  but Mom!\u00e2\u0080\u009d)  Matchbox cars  Bubble Yum (\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly Yum is the fun that never blows out!\u00e2\u0080\u009d)  and Fred Meyer fashions (\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou wanna dance?\u00e2\u0080\u009d a girl asks him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI like your sweater\u00e2\u0080\u009d). He won his first TV roles \u00e2\u0080\u0094 after being kicked off the set of Romper Room  at 3 years old \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in The New Lassie and Parenthood. He was good at playing junior-high heartthrobs and squeaky-clean sons  but the more he got cast in those parts  the less interested in them he seemed to be. By the time he was cast as Jack Dawson  Leonardo DiCaprio had already been nominated for a best supporting actor Academy Award for his role as the title character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s developmentally disabled younger brother  Arnie  in What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Eating Gilbert Grape. Initially  director Lasse Hallstr\u00c3\u00b6m had believed DiCaprio was too handsome for the role \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a judgment born out by the fact that fan mail for him was already streaming onto the set of Growing Pains. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I was doing Growing Pains I had quite a teen following \u00e2\u0080\u009d DiCaprio said in a 1993 interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor a while  I was third in fan mail or something like that. To tell you the truth  I don't like that. Being the hunk-of-the-month annoys me. ... I don't care about being a star. Anybody can be a star with a little makeup and a music video. I'm concerned about being an actor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  James Cameron  knew  he  wanted DiCaprio to be  his  Jack Dawson  but DiCaprio didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be  his   Jack . When DiCaprio auditioned for the role   Cameron  later remembered   he  first refused to read a scene with Kate Winslet  then \u00e2\u0080\u009cread it once  [and started] goofing around.\u00e2\u0080\u009d After that   Cameron  said  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI could never get  him  to focus on it again. But for one split second  a shaft of light came down from the heavens and lit up the forest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d DiCaprio had never played a character like  Jack  before: one who forced  him  to be  so relentlessly  in the light. Instead   he  had spent  his  early career playing roles like the heroin-addicted Jim Carroll in 1995\u00e2\u0080\u0099s The Basketball Diaries  and Arthur Rimbaud (\u00e2\u0080\u009cyoung  gorgeous  and deranged\u00e2\u0080\u009d) in Total Eclipse. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do you do that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d DiCaprio said of  his  role in Titanic  even after filming had ended. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was asking Jim  \u00e2\u0080\u0098Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we add some dark things to  his  character?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And  he  was like  \u00e2\u0080\u0098No  Leo  you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI just wasn't used to playing an openhearted  free-spirited guy \u00e2\u0080\u009d DiCaprio told the Los Angeles Times shortly after the Titanic premiere. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI've played the more tortured roles in the past. It was difficult to be someone closer to 'me' than anyone else.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis character doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go through torment \u00e2\u0080\u009d  Cameron  later said of the role  \u00e2\u0080\u009cand Leo previously  and subsequently in his career  was always looking for that dark cloud. ... [It was] only when I convinced him [this] was actually the harder thing to do that he got excited.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Titanic represented a new challenge for  James Cameron   too. It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t his first romantic movie (try listening to the love theme from The Terminator sometime)  but it was the first movie he had ever made where a love story served as the primary dramatic engine. When he pitched Titanic to Fox Chairman Peter Chernin in 1995  Cameron \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who had cracked into the big leagues after making 1984\u00e2\u0080\u0099s The Terminator  and had seen his sequel  Terminator 2: Judgment Day  become the highest-grossing movie of 1991 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 found himself in the odd position of trying to sell studio executives on exactly the kind of movie they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think he could make. \"They were like  'Oooooohkaaaaaay \u00e2\u0080\u0099\" he later told Paula Parisi  author of Titanic and the Making of  James Cameron . \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098A three-hour romantic epic? Sure  that's just what we want. Is there a little bit of Terminator in that? Any Harrier jets  shoot-outs  or car chases?' I said  'No  no  no. It's not like that.'\" Yet  James Cameron  was  in a sense  a natural choice for the helm of a romantic epic:  He  knew how to translate love into action. From the beginning   his  heroes and heroines had been made powerful by their ability to love  and by love\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to instill in them greater strength than any opponent could hope to defeat. The Terminator ends with Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) speaking gently to her unborn son as she drives into a mounting storm; in Aliens  Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) balances a little girl on one hip and a flamethrower on the other; and in Judgment Day  the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger)  programmed to protect the adolescent John Connor  tells John \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know now why you cry\u00e2\u0080\u009d as he destroys himself to save the future of humanity. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBuilding Better Worlds\u00e2\u0080\u009d is the space conglomerate slogan on display in James Cameron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Aliens  but it could just as easily apply to the worlds  Cameron  builds in  his  movies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or rather  the worlds  he  allows to come into being  by stripping away the rules as they have always previously applied. In The Terminator  Terminator 2  and Aliens  this idea seems to go hand in hand with getting rid of men \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and Titanic follows this example. Even if men aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actively oppressing women  Cameron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movies suggest  they still have a way of holding women back from doing what they need to. Even if all you want is to save John Connor  you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still a product of Skynet. The best protection you can offer the world is to leave it.\nBefore filming even began   Cameron  knew  his  $110 million budget projection was only an educated guess. To begin with  Fox would have to build a brand-new studio from the ground up  something neither it nor any other major movie company had done since the 1930s. No one knew how much it cost to do that kind of thing anymore \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to say nothing of the price tag for conjuring the past with computer-generated effects so brand-new that their final cost was also impossible to estimate. But if anyone could make Titanic work  Fox executives felt  it was  James Cameron . He had made Terminator 2  from script to premiere  in 13 months: He shot the movie six days a week  and on the seventh day  he edited. (Crew members somehow found enough time away from their grueling production schedule to make shirts reading \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t scare me  I work for  James Cameron .\u00e2\u0080\u009d) He liked to say he had won his first directing gig \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for Piranha II: The Spawning  the sequel to a Jaws knockoff \u00e2\u0080\u0094 because he convinced producers he could make mealworms writhe on command. (He had called \u00e2\u0080\u009cAction!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and then electrified them with an AC current.) He had a reputation as a miracle worker  and he encouraged it. How else could you convince a roomful of businessmen to give you the money you needed to project your dreams and nightmares directly into the American mind? The question was just how much this dream was going to cost.  Cameron  asked for $125 million to make Titanic. Fox Chairman Peter Chernin balked  and told  Cameron   he  could make the movie  he  had first pitched as \u00e2\u0080\u009cRomeo and Juliet on a boat\u00e2\u0080\u009d if  he  could have it ready for a July 1997 release  and keep the budget to $110 million.  Cameron   perhaps believing this might really be possible at the time \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and perhaps also figuring it was better to beg for forgiveness than to ask for permission \u00e2\u0080\u0094 said  he  could do it  offering to forfeit $4 million of  his  own salary to squeeze under the line. Almost as soon as Titanic went into production  it began to go over budget. In 1996  shooting a typical action blockbuster \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a Batman Forever or a Tomorrow Never Dies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 cost an average of $100 000 to $150 000 a day. Titanic averaged between $225 000 and $300 000 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and this was after construction ended on the brand-new 40-acre movie studio  Cameron  needed to film it.  He  had considered locations all over the world  and ultimately decided on a spot 15 miles south of the border  in Rosarito  Mexico. Workers needed 10 000 tons of dynamite to blast a hole in the coastline big enough for the 17-million-gallon open-air tank \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the largest ever built \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that  Cameron  needed to hold  his  ship. And in a detail that becomes noteworthy when the movie in question is so concerned with the politics and hierarchies of labor \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and Titanic never for a moment lets you forget that the captain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pleasure in his \u00e2\u0080\u009cunsinkable\u00e2\u0080\u009d ship is powered by the sweat of the stokers in the hold  \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Cameron  shot Titanic in Mexico in part to keep labor costs down. (\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is NAFTA at work!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Fox\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tom Sherak told journalists who visited the set.)\nLess than halfway through its seven-month shooting schedule  the movie had gobbled up nearly three-quarters of its budget  and showed no signs of slowing down \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and  Cameron  seemed unwilling to make it slow down. So  Paula Parisi writes in Titanic and the Making of  James Cameron   the studio did its best to persuade  him . One night in the fall of 1996  20th Century Fox President Bill Mechanic visited  Cameron  onset during his 2 a.m. lunch hour  a schedule necessitated by the movie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s endless night shoots. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom a financial standpoint \u00e2\u0080\u009d Mechanic told him  \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis film is wildly out of control. Nothing is going to change that. All we can do now is contain it. So here are some scenes we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like you to cut from the shooting schedule.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Cameron  studied the list of scenes  and immediately refused to cut any of them. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you want to cut my film \u00e2\u0080\u009d  James Cameron  told the president of Fox  \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to fire me  and to fire me you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to kill me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then he stormed off set. The scenes stayed in the picture. Mechanic had little choice but to relent: No other director could manage all the moving parts Titanic required. When  Cameron  asked Peter Chernin to fund  his  submersible expedition to Titanic   he  wanted not just to see the wreck himself  but to film it in a way that would allow viewers to feel they were there with  him . Doing so would also allow  him  to do Bob Ballard one better: Ballard may have found the ship  but  he  had only been able to capture video of it with  his  underwater remote operating vehicle  Jason. (Ballard had also initially wished to keep Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s location secret.)  Cameron  might not be shooting Titanic first  but  he  was going to do it right.  His  engineer brother  Mike \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the only Cameron boy who finished college \u00e2\u0080\u0094 developed a titanium-encased film camera capable of independently withstanding the pressure of the ocean floor  and of capturing images of Titanic as it had never been seen before. Each dive would cost $25 000  and could record only 10 minutes of film. Some of the footage  Cameron  brought back from Titanic appears in the movie. Some is recreated. But what  Cameron  also seems to have brought back from those dives was a new sense of humility about the task before  him . After  his  second trip to Titanic   Cameron  told Paula Parisi  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI just sat there  and I just started to cry  thinking about the dive and everything I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d seen and experienced.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Later   he  wrote in James Cameron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Titanic: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat night I realized that my project  my film  was doomed to failure if it could not convey the emotion of that night rather than the fact of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d More and more  it seemed to  him  that  he  could only let viewers experience Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sinking by letting them fully experience the ship itself \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and  he  could only do that by recreating it.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wanted to be able to say to an audience  without the slightest pang of guilt: This is real \u00e2\u0080\u009d  Cameron  wrote of Titanic. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is what happened. Exactly like this. If you went back in a time machine and stood on the deck  this is what you would have seen\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Second Officer Lightoller would be over there \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and Wallace Hartley would be leading the band in a lively waltz just there  a few yards away \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 [and] slaloming between these immovable pylons of historical fact are  Jack  and Rose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In this way   Cameron  wrote  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe film comes full circle  from being a film about Titanic  to being a love story that happens merely to be set on Titanic  back to being about the emotional truth of Titanic after all. By feeling the fear  the loss  the heartbreak of  Jack  and Rose  we finally can feel for the 1 500.\u00e2\u0080\u009d After seeing Titanic for the first time  Harry Knowles compared the experience to traveling to the past through self-willed hypnosis  like the hero of Somewhere in Time. Titanic experts who visited Cameron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s set had the same experience in the flesh.  Cameron \u00e2\u0080\u0099s devotion to history was exacting  and at times excruciating: Every possible detail  from the davits used to lower the lifeboats to the carpet in the first-class dining saloon (recreated  all 18 000 square feet of it  by the same company that had manufactured the original)  was identical to what Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s passengers would have seen. When the furniture being artificially aged for a scene recreating the wreck didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look quite right to  Cameron    he  spent a day and a half working on the props himself. ( He  was supposed to be finishing the screenplay at the time.) \u00e2\u0080\u009c Cameron  wanted real wallpaper and things like that \" the movie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head of physical production  Fred Gallo  recalled. \"I said  'Why don't you build the sets and have them paint on the wallpaper? No one will ever know.'\u00e2\u0080\u009d But  Cameron  would. Thousands of props  from ashtrays to teacups to forks  had to be stamped with the White Star Line emblem  even if it was impossible for viewers to see. The costumes alone cost $8.4 million. The chandeliers couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be Lucite   Cameron  decided  because then they wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t chime ominously as the ship began to tilt; they would have to be crystal  just as they had been in 1912. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere should be a little brass sign right here that says \u00e2\u0080\u0098Push \u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Cameron  said apologetically to Ken Marschall  as he led the Titanic expert through a doorway on D deck during a set visit. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was one delight after another \u00e2\u0080\u009d Marschall said of his time on Titanic. But he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to work there.\n\"You don't just join one of his films \" editor Mark Goldblatt said of  James Cameron . \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou sign on for a tour of duty.\" On Titanic  two-thirds of the shoot had to be done at night  and even the cast sometimes worked 20-hour days. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing could have prepared me for it \u00e2\u0080\u009d Kate Winslet later said. Night after night  as Titanic sank again and again  she and Leonardo DiCaprio had to struggle through water pumped in straight from the ocean. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI bet people will think it's heated \u00e2\u0080\u009d she wrote in her diary  \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut it isn't.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The crew watched actors vigilantly for signs of hypothermia. (Later  they would begin heating the water  even though Winslet had believed the cold would make her performance more authentic). \"I chipped a small bone in my elbow  and at one point I had deep bruises all over my arms \" Kate Winslet told the Los Angeles Times once Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arduous shoot was over. \"I looked like a battered wife.\" Filming underwater close-ups  where Winslet had to be weighted in a tank while completely submerged  terrified her.  Cameron   she wrote  \u00e2\u0080\u009cwouldn't have made me do that if I didn't say  \u00e2\u0080\u0098No  I'm okay.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\" But even though it was a highly supervised set  with safety divers everywhere  she sometimes felt like she was drowning. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTake after take \u00e2\u0080\u009d Winslet wrote in her diary  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI reminded myself that I wanted to be part of this. I will not admit defeat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nNo one would. Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s budget continued to swell as  Cameron  continued to fall behind schedule  and its release date was pushed back from July to December. Fox shunted Speed 2 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which some executives had higher hopes for  anyway \u00e2\u0080\u0094 into the summer release slot Titanic was meant to fill. It flopped  and Titanic plunged ahead  its budget once rising by $20 million in the space of two chaotic weeks. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot think of one crew member who didn't say  'I've had it \u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d first assistant director Sebasti\u00c3\u00a1n Silva said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut no one walked.\" As far as  Cameron \u00e2\u0080\u0099s temper went  Kate Winslet said  \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe actors got off lightly. I think Jim knew he couldn't shout at us the way he did to his crew because our performances would be no good.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAny idiot could figure this out!\u00e2\u0080\u009d This  Paula Parisi wrote  was a standard  Cameron  response to crew members who couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make his vision a reality fast enough. He raged at workers and he raged at executives and he seemed sometimes to want  more than anything  to simply be able to do every single job on Titanic himself. When the ice arrived  in hundred-pound blocks   Cameron  picked up an ax and started chopping  preparing it for the scene where it was to splinter off the iceberg and fall onto the deck. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGetting over their initial disbelief \u00e2\u0080\u009d Paula Parisi wrote  \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe crew followed suit. ... Giving up his ax   Cameron  stepped back and watched for thirty seconds  then  he  just couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand it anymore.  He  pushed a puny guy aside  taking  his  ax. It was just too much fun.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Cameron   Parisi wrote  was \u00e2\u0080\u009cshowing that he knew full well the film was going to be hard work  but no one would work harder than he would.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maybe. But Titanic  Parisi also observed  \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas a factory \u00e2\u0080\u009d and it had only one product:  Cameron \u00e2\u0080\u0099s dream. Cameron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recreation of the ship itself contained 300 tons of steel  bolted together  at a breakneck pace  by 30 laborers. The wardrobe department needed 8 000 separate articles of clothing to dress the extras for the Southampton scene alone. Every time  Cameron  sank the first-class dining saloon  and raised it again for another take  crew members spent the next workday drying carpets  righting furniture  collecting 1 800 pieces of flatware off the floor  and recreating Titanic all over again. Titanic had one boss and hundreds of workers  and though it amassed superlative after superlative in terms of monetary costs well over a year before it even reached theaters  its cost in terms of human labor may be yet more staggering. What does it feel like to surrender seven months of your life  for nearly every waking hour of the day  to one man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vision? What does it do to you? What makes you stay?\nFor the laborers and extras hired in Rosarito  it probably had something to do with the pay; for the crew  it probably had something to do with the prestige; for the cast  it probably had something to do with the exposure. But among the cast and crew members who described not just the tortuous process of making Titanic but their own dedication to the film  a shared conviction is always present: They were doing something real  and they could feel it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne thing that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very important to me in life \u00e2\u0080\u009d Kate Winslet said while Titanic was in production  \u00e2\u0080\u009cis [that] through having a relationship with somebody and loving that person and being allowed to feel the whole emotion of love despite all of the risks  you can find out who you are. And when Rose meets  Jack  she cuts through all of the class and money nonsense and connects with something real and alive and passionate in  his  soul. And when I read the script I was in floods of tears  because it takes you to the point where you would do anything \u00e2\u0080\u0094 absolutely anything \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to stop that ship from sinking.\u00e2\u0080\u009d If Titanic felt real \u00e2\u0080\u0094 if it was real \u00e2\u0080\u0094 then perhaps this painfully conjured time travel was the only way to make  Jack  and Rose  and the love between them  become real as well.  James Cameron  spent the summer of 1997 in an at-home editing room darkened by blackout curtains  faceting the dream  he  had now poured years of  his  life into. In late July   he  took a day off to marry Linda Hamilton   his  girlfriend of seven years  in a backyard ceremony. The next day   he  went back to  his  editing suite  and back to Titanic. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTaped to  his  editing machine \u00e2\u0080\u009d Entertainment Weekly reported in November 1997  \u00e2\u0080\u009cis a suicide device \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a razor blade with the simple instruction \u00e2\u0080\u0098Use only if film sucks.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nOn TitanicShack \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one of the many websites and forums that sprang up after the movie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s release as outlets for people confronted by the grim fact that they couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spend every single day in the theater  watching Titanic again and again \u00e2\u0080\u0094 fans wondered why the movie had such a hold on them. Some felt as mystified as the movie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s harshest critics did about just why they couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop themselves from returning to Titanic: I've seen this movie 13 times (and yes  I must go back  if only because 13's unlucky! :-) Why do I  a thirty-something  sane woman keep going back? Because I love this movie \u00e2\u0080\u0094 everything about it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and I know they'll letterbox it when it comes out on video and it just WON'T be the same on my tiny 19-inch tv screen. Someone told me a story about a woman in the States who was kicked out of the theatre for reciting every line with the movie. She had ticket stubs to prove she had seen it 84 times!! Now that's a bit excessive!!!! I can't really pinpoint why I keep going back. All I can say is that this movie gets to me every single time... The life lessons it teaches are many  but there is one theme in particular that all humankind never tires of hearing: love really is the greatest power of all. As it continued its dominance of Americans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hearts and minds  almost anything Titanic touched became a guaranteed moneymaker. The J. Peterman catalog began selling what it advertised as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfairly enormous\u00e2\u0080\u009d $198 Heart of the Ocean necklace  and quickly ran out of stock (disappointed customers could  however  content themselves with a $19 knockoff called \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Jewel of the Sea \u00e2\u0080\u009d at least until Fox sued the company that made it). C\u00c3\u00a9line Dion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy Heart Will Go On\u00e2\u0080\u009d became the world's best-selling single of 1998  and pushed the Titanic soundtrack to the top of the charts  too. ( Cameron  had initially resisted including any song over the closing credits  feeling it was akin to commissioning a pop single for the soundtrack to Schindler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s List. But Horner and Dion cut a demo in secret  and won him over.) Even \u00e2\u0080\u0094 maybe especially \u00e2\u0080\u0094 after the movie was gone from theaters  any piece of media that summoned its world would suffice for fans.  James Cameron \u00e2\u0080\u0099s Titanic  a glossy coffee table book detailing the movie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s production  shot to the top of the New York Times best-seller list  and candy-hued unauthorized biographies of Leonardo DiCaprio began appearing in bookstores  and in smitten girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 backpacks. \"There's a lot of me in Jack  definitely \"  James Cameron  told Rolling Stone in 1998  in an interview in which  he  also discussed  his  recent separation from Linda Hamilton. She had been  his  fourth wife  and  his  Sarah Connor. \"Actually \u00e2\u0080\u009d  Cameron  clarified  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI shouldn't say that. Jack is the guy I wished I could have been. I wished I had the courage and the openness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nReading the Titanic screenplay  it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to tell which character  Cameron  wished  he  could have been: Even the simplest descriptions of Jack find a way to be adoring. One of Jack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sketches \u00e2\u0080\u009ccaptures [Cora and her father] perfectly  with a great sense of the humanity of the moment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sketchbook is \u00e2\u0080\u009ca celebration of the human condition.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As Jack stargazes before his first conversation with Rose  he is thinking not just any thoughts  but \u00e2\u0080\u009cartist thoughts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And as Rose begins to fall for Jack  we listen in on her first impressions of him: He \u00e2\u0080\u009cis so open and real...not like anyone she has ever known.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Remembering the iconic \u00e2\u0080\u009cking of the world\u00e2\u0080\u009d scene \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one he later reenacted  to near-universal disdain  at the 1998 Academy Awards \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Cameron described the kind of power  the kind of joy  that even the experience of commanding a vast and imposing structure \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a ship  a movie set \u00e2\u0080\u0094 couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily allow you to feel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see the power of [Titanic] \u00e2\u0080\u009d he said of the scene  \u00e2\u0080\u009cand you see the satisfaction of the officers who run the ship  and their domination of the elements. And then I take that energy and I give it to Jack. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an artist. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a guy who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s able to have his heart soar. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s his ship  man. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter that he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a dime. This is his ship  and his moment. He owns the moment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To survey (and enjoy) the power of the vast system he commands  the captain \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009ca great patriarch of the sea\u00e2\u0080\u009d in Cameron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s script \u00e2\u0080\u0094 must stand on the bridge and look at Titanic itself. But Jack  because this is not his ship and not his dream  can stand at Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prow as it cuts through the water  feeling the sun on his face  and watching the dolphins that leap and swim \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor the sheer joy and exultation of motion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He can fully experience Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s power because he feels no need to convince himself he commands it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and then he can give it to Rose. \"I've been part of a film that's broken cultural boundaries \u00e2\u0080\u009d DiCaprio reflected in 2004. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI went to the middle of Brazil  in the rainforest  and the Indians there knew [Titanic]. It's surreal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d From the beginning  it was clear Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success transcended borders. When it finally left US theaters in the fall of 1998 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 staying on the big screen even after it was released on video \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it had made $659 million domestically. In the process  it became the highest-grossing movie in US history  shattering the record comfortably held  for 20 years  by Star Wars. (George Lucas took out an ad in Variety where Han and Leia posed like Jack and Rose to publicly congratulate Cameron  perhaps with some sense of relief: Heavy is the head that wears the big-gross crown.) But Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worldwide theatrical gross was nearly $2.2 billion. In a March 1998 article titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cFan Sinks into Titanic Obsession \u00e2\u0080\u009d the Associated Press reported that a 12-year-old girl named Gloria had gone to see Titanic  at the only movie theater in the town of Castelfranco Emilia  Italy  every single night since its release  and that she would go on watching it until she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anymore. She had seen it 50 times so far and wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tired of it yet; the theater no longer charged her admission  and \u00e2\u0080\u0094 recognizing that the love of an adolescent girl is nothing to be trifled with \u00e2\u0080\u0094 saved her favorite seat for her every night. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJack is cuter than Leo \u00e2\u0080\u009d Gloria clarified  for anyone who wondered.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cExperts say that the pure passion that pre-adolescent girls have for their idols represents a time in their lives that is brief  intense and \u00e2\u0080\u0094 once it's run its course \u00e2\u0080\u0094 gone forever \u00e2\u0080\u009d Frances Grandy Taylor wrote in the Hartford Courant in March 1998  in one of the countless articles and TV segments that tried to help parents understand Leomania. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cgone forever\u00e2\u0080\u009d part must have seemed particularly comforting. When the unafflicted tried to make sense of the phenomenon following the movie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s release  they tended to focus on Leo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s looks and his celebrity  and of course they weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wrong. Like all adolescent crushes  he was perfect and remote: He couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hurt you  couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reject you  couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t disappoint you. And as Jack Dawson  he was pure fantasy: so handsome as to seem almost unearthly; an androgynous angel who wanted only to love you  to worship you  and to be the idea of a romantic partner  one with whom reality could never try to compete. He was a dream  the argument went  and that was why adolescent girls \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who were overwhelmingly presented in the media as the driving force behind Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success  regardless of whether this was quite true or not \u00e2\u0080\u0094 kept going back to the theater for more. It was wish fulfillment. But what were we really wishing for? More than any  Cameron  protagonist before  him   Jack Dawson is heroic for his ability to love. He can watch the world as he knew it fall apart around him and not feel that everything he believed in \u00e2\u0080\u0094 hierarchy  order  masculinity \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is being yanked out from under his feet  because he never felt much of a need to believe in it  anyway. When Jack turns up in a tuxedo to accompany Rose to dinner in first class  he first exaggerates the aristocracy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s manners just enough to make them seem absurd  then captivates some of the wealthiest people in the world with stories of the kind of freedom they can barely allow themselves to imagine. Rose\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life  as she has lived it so far  has taught her that she is an object to be bought and sold: All women are  and the best you can hope for  as a woman  is to be the most expensive object  sold to the richest buyer. Jack saves Rose from literal death \u00e2\u0080\u0094 twice \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but he also saves her from the society- and self-imposed prison of believing that she can only ever inhabit the role she was born into. \u00e2\u0080\u009c'Titanic' is starting to sail out of movie theaters \u00e2\u0080\u009d conservative commentator Betsy Hart wrote in 1998  \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut it may have left a wake of devastation in its path in the hearts of teenage girls everywhere.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As heartbreaking as the movie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ending was  Hart found that she was \u00e2\u0080\u009csaddened much more\u00e2\u0080\u009d by the thought of \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe millions of teenage girls\u00e2\u0080\u009d who had helped make the movie a hit  and who had been duped into thinking that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe intense sentiment and easy sex over a few days that formed the romantic centerpiece of Titanic is the kind of love they should strive for.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's little wonder \u00e2\u0080\u009d Hart concluded  that \u00e2\u0080\u009cour society has so many young people that need so much rescuing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThis analysis has always been obviously wrong in at least one more way: Titanic is not a fun movie to watch. You aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t escaping from anything so much as putting yourself through an emotional ordeal: a decathlon of passion  dread  terror  numbness  and finally cathartic hope. You  yourself  have survived something by the end of Titanic; you have sat immersed in death  in dying  in questions about your own behavior in such a situation  and have asked yourself to believe in love in the face of all this \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and perhaps have been able to. For that experience  we were willing to go back to Titanic over and over again. And if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re focusing on the girls in the audience  then please \u00e2\u0080\u0094 let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really think about them. Who were these girls  and why were they there? Why was I? When Titanic was in theaters  girls of 9 and 10 and 11 and 12 and 13 shaped their lives around it  and fell in love not just with Leo  but with the whole story they had first found him in. We had a sense  maybe  that life as we knew it was not so different from Titanic: that we  too  lived in a world where society might have to fall apart completely before we could be liberated from the roles that gender and class and race forced us to occupy. In Titanic  Rose is freed not because her mother and her fianc\u00c3\u00a9 die (they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t)  but because a microcosm of the world as she knows it collapses around her  and in that moment she realizes its rules no longer dictate her existence. They were never really real  of course \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but now that she has seen the spectacular defeat of every system the society that raised her guaranteed would work forever  she can no longer even feel its laws governing her. Something breaks when you no longer believe that anyone  anywhere  can build an unsinkable ship. And if you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put your faith in a system like a ship \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or a government \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you have to start directing all your trust  all your love  to the people around you. Titanic poses the question of what we can hold onto when the structures and beliefs we have built our lives on founder beneath us  and one of the answers it allows us to reach is: each other. We hold onto each other. Recently  a writer friend told me that this year  as the world has started to feel like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s falling apart  he has found himself turning again and again to W.H. Auden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s closing lines in \u00e2\u0080\u009cSeptember 1  1939\u00e2\u0080\u009d: Hunger allows no choice To the citizen or the police; We must love one another or die. In the past year  I have developed the same kind of relationship \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have been taking the same kind of refuge  grasping for the same kind of wisdom \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with Titanic. When I first fell in love with Titanic  at 9 years old  I wanted to be Jack as much as I wanted to be loved by him. I wanted the freedom he enjoyed: freedom that seemed to give him the ability to love so deeply and so selflessly. It was the kind of freedom the world around me said a girl could never have. But the world had also told Rose that  and she had found that freedom  in the end. Yet no matter how vast James Cameron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abilities were  his imagination \u00e2\u0080\u0094 big enough to bring a lost ship back to life; big enough  even  to let the viewer feel some sense of what 1 500 lost souls really means \u00e2\u0080\u0094 still couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t conjure a vision so radical that it could let Jack survive. If it were possible for  James Cameron  to imagine masculinity doing anything  in the long term  but infecting everything around it with violence and arrogance and greed and destruction  then Jack could have survived. If  Cameron  were able to imagine a world beyond the hierarchy of patriarchal control \u00e2\u0080\u0094 instead of just spectacularly destroying one \u00e2\u0080\u0094 then Jack could have survived. If he could have imagined possibilities for men beyond either blindly following the patriarchy or dying for its sins  then Jack could have survived. But instead  Jack has to die  and to love Rose in the only way a world of patriarchal masculinity  even one reduced to flotsam  will allow: by giving his life for hers. Beyond even Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unresolved questions about masculinity  the one radical possibility  James Cameron  seems unable to imagine is one in which partners can lovingly empower each other through a life lived together. This is where we have no choice but to do what he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t: to imagine such love  and live it. To focus on nurture  and let go of heroism. To know that love is the only way through. To say: Get on this board  you idiot.

It's based at the University of Pennsylvania and is 1 of 5 partners Facebook featured when it rolled out the initiative in December 2016.\nSHAHANI: That's FactCheck director Eugene Kiely. Facebook  one of the largest companies on earth  is meticulous when rolling out new products. Current and former employees have told NPR about the way engineers pore over code for live video or messenger  making sure it lives up to the promise and troubleshooting very  very quickly. But in this case  there wasn't even a budget line for months.\nSHAHANI: He used the money to hire Saranac Hale Spencer  who had previously worked for a legal newspaper covering federal courts and then a Gannett paper in Delaware. She says this job is definitely different.\nSHAHANI: How does it feel?\nSHAHANI: Here's how her work day starts. She logs into Facebook and goes to a special dashboard. It shows links users have flagged as fake news ranked by popularity. So Spencer has a sense of what's getting a lot of attention. A few days ago  just before Tuesday's Senate election in Alabama  she saw fake news stories about candidate Roy Moore trending.\n SHAHANI : The story said two women who accused Moore of pedophilia were caught lying.\n SHAHANI : Spencer and her team found that  contrary to the fake news claims  there was no MSNBC interview or any TV interview record for that matter. And the picture in the article was actually of a British reality TV star just after a very painful pregnancy.\nSHAHANI: It takes Spencer about one full day of work to debunk the fake news. She submits her fact-checked article to Facebook on the eve of an election the entire country is watching. Clearly  this is important work. But that's separate from whether or not the work has an impact. I ask a question about her fact-checking article  to which director Eugene Kiely responds.\nSHAHANI: You're not given that feedback?\nSHAHANI: Meaning Facebook does not tell the fact checkers how many times their work product reaches users compared with how many times the fake news reaches them - could be 1 to 2 or 1 to 10 or 1 to 100 000. Facebook says that's proprietary data not for outsiders  even partners  to know. Factcheck.org and others in this partnership have asked Facebook for more transparency. But even if he's kept in the dark  Kiely says  he knows there is a reach.\nSHAHANI: In this way  the fact-check project exposes an ongoing question. Seasoned journalists in newsrooms are torn about whether participation with Facebook  in fact checking  in sharing content on news feed  in live video is grabbing a seat at an important table or giving cover to a broken relationship. A Facebook spokesperson says the fact checkers are valuable to the company  and Facebook will provide them with additional tools and metrics in the new year.

Asked about the media frenzy surrounding their courtship  the 36-year-old said: \"At the end of the day I think it's really simple ... we're two people who are really happy and in love.\"\nDescribing Harry as her \"boyfriend  \" Markle  said that while  she  expected that  she  and Harry would have to \"come forward\" about their relationship at some point  the two were just a couple enjoying time spent with each other.\n\"Personally  I love a great love story \"  she  said.\n Markle 's Vanity Fair interview broke new ground. It is unusual for a royal love interest to speak so publicly -- and candidly -- before becoming engaged. Harry's past reported girlfriends all shied away from the media limelight  and his sister-in-law  formerly known as Kate Middleton  stayed silent until she and Prince William gave a formal televised interview at Buckingham Palace after their engagement became public.\nBut then  unlike some other \"commoners\" romantically linked to Britain's royals   Markle  is no stranger to media exposure and the world of show business.\nThe actress's most successful role is the feisty Rachel Zane in the TV legal show \"Suits \" now in its seventh season.  Her  career has included small parts on TV series including \"Fringe \" \"CSI: Miami \" \"Knight Rider\" and \"Castle \" as well as movies such as \"Horrible Bosses.\" Outside of acting   Markle  founded a lifestyle blog called TheTig.com (which closed down in April without explanation)  and has lent  her  celebrity status to humanitarian causes.\n She  has campaigned with the United Nations on gender equality  written in Time magazine about girls' education and the stigma surrounding menstruation  and has traveled to Rwanda as global ambassador for the charity World Vision Canada.  She  has described how  her  mother took  her  to the slums of Jamaica to witness poverty first-hand  saying experiences like that shaped  her  social consciousness and charity work.\nTo some degree that mirrors the experience of Harry  who was also inspired by his mother's humanitarian work and embraced the types of charities Diana favored in the final years of  her  life before  her  1997 death in a Paris car crash.\nHarry and  Markle  held hands for their first official appearance together in September in Toronto at the Invictus Games  a sporting event for wounded service personnel that Harry spearheaded.\nBoth were dressed casually in jeans  smiling and chatting as they arrived for a tennis match.

Ralph Northam  saw his lead over Gillespie erode over the past few weeks.  Trump  weighed in for Gillespie in a series of tweets and with automated Election Day phone calls encouraging turnout.\n.@EdWGillespie will totally turn around the high crime and poor economic performance of VA. MS-13 and crime will be gone. Vote today  ASAP! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7  2017\n Trump  wasted no time in distancing  himself  from Gillespie  enjoying the spaciousness of  his  now-280-character tweets.\nEd Gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for. Don\u2019t forget  Republicans won 4 out of 4 House seats  and with the economy doing record numbers  we will continue to win  even bigger than before! \u2014  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 8   2017\nWe\u2019ve noted before that  Trump  has an insurance premium against any calls for  his  impeachment.  His  popularity with Republicans has slipped since the beginning of  his  presidency  but  he \u2019s still very popular with them  particularly more conservative members of  his  party. (Per Gallup  more than 9 in 10 conservative Republicans approve of  Trump .) Because Republican Party primaries see an overrepresentation of conservatives  that meant that Republicans eager to win reelection to Congress were less likely to turn on the president.\n Trump\u2019s  tweet distancing  himself  from Gillespie sugarcoats the election in a way that may make  Trump  feel better but probably isn\u2019t fooling anyone on Capitol Hill.  His  claim that the GOP won four of four federal races misses a few important points. The first is that those races were in Republican-held districts. The second is that the Democrats saw big gains in most of those races relative to past elections. The third is that the figure is actually four of five;  Trump  likes to ignore a race in California won by the Democrats.\nBut it also does something very dangerous for  Trump  right now. It shows  yet again  that  he  isn\u2019t loyal to  his  political partners.\nWe\u2019ve seen this before. When  Trump  backed the House effort to repeal and replace Obamacare (having no plan of  his  own)   he  responded to  its  passage by declaring the bill to be \u201cmean\u201d \u2014 as though  he  hadn\u2019t previously claimed it was nearly without flaws. (It was health care  not immigration  that was the big issue in Virginia  according to exit polls. Northam won among voters concerned about health care by a more than 3-to-1 margin.) Even before Election Day in Alabama earlier this year   Trump  began to distance  himself  from  his  preferred candidate Republican Senate primary  Luther Strange  hinting that  he  had perhaps made a mistake \u2014 a shift that was certainly informed by polls showing a likely Strange loss. When that happened   Trump  deleted some of  his  tweets of endorsement.\nStrange\u2019s campaign  unlike Gillespie\u2019s  didn\u2019t embrace Trumpist politics such as the threat of the gang MS-13.  He  tried to win as a more typical establishment conservative  to no avail. Gillespie tried to more directly embrace  Trump  politics \u2014 and lost badly. And then saw  Trump  turn on him.\nThink of the message that  Trump  has sent to Republicans. Stand with him on policy and have him bad-mouth what you passed. Embrace his endorsement and see a loss followed by  Trump  playing down his support. Embrace his endorsement and his politics  and see a loss followed by actual criticism. These are all one-offs \u2014 but politics generally suffers from a small sample size from which to draw conclusions  and no one spends more time trying to draw conclusions than politicians.\nBannon\u2019s track record in electoral politics? He helped  Trump  lose the popular vote and win the electoral college in 2016. He embraced Luther Strange\u2019s opponent after Strange was trailing. And now he watched the \u201cTrump-Stewart talking points\u201d lead nowhere.\nOn its home page  Breitbart also championed  Trump \u2019s argument that Gillespie should have embraced him more robustly. That\u2019s a flawed theory.  Trump  is very unpopular in Virginia  and Northam won among those who disapprove of  Trump  by a 7-to-1 margin  according to preliminary exit polls. A third of voters said their vote in the race was meant to send a message of opposition to  Trump  \u2014 twice as many as said it was a message of support.\nWhat\u2019s more   Trump  made  his  feelings clear. Those who wanted to vote for  Trump\u2019s  candidate knew who that candidate was. As in Alabama  voters went in another direction.\nIt\u2019s critical to remember that Democrats were supposed to win this race  albeit not necessarily by as wide a margin as they did. Democrats hold the governor\u2019s mansion and Hillary Clinton won by five points last year.  Trump  could have congratulated Gillespie on a hard-fought race and noted the uphill battle. Instead   he  decided to try to spin the loss to  his  advantage.\nIt\u2019s unlikely that many Republicans worried about next November will be convinced by  Trump \u2019s argument. Instead  they\u2019re likely to take another lesson:  Trump  can\u2019t deliver a victory for you when you\u2019re trailing  and neither can Trumpism. (In fact  there\u2019s every reason to think that  Trump  was the liability that  his  poll numbers would suggest  with Gillespie doing fine in western Virginia but getting beaten badly in more-Democratic Northern Virginia.) Nor will  Trump  stand with you should things go south.\nIf  next summer  the question of  Trump \u2019s fate as president is raised  how might Republicans in center-right districts be expected to evaluate that decision?", "output": "Trump just made a bad night for Republicans much worse for himself", "category": "Title Generation 1046.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, generate a short title of the document.

Urlacher and Lewis bring to 28 the number of modern-era linebackers in the Hall. Five of those 28 were Bears  a nod to the history of the position for the franchise from George Connor to Bill George  Dick Butkus  Mike Singletary and now  Urlacher .\n\u201cIt\u2019s unreal \u201d  Urlacher  said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great tradition.\u201d\nSelected ninth in the first round of the 2000 draft   Urlacher  becomes the first Hall of Fame playerfrom the University of New Mexico.  He  was named NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year and was an established star before coach Lovie Smith arrived in 2004 with a scheme that accentuated  Urlacher \u2019s freakish athletic ability for a player with such a large frame \u2014 6-foot-4  258 pounds. The next year  he  was named the league\u2019s Defensive Player of the Year  becoming the fifth player to win both awards. The next season  in 2006   Urlacher  helped lead the Bears to Super Bowl XLI.\nNamed to the NFL\u2019s All-Decade Team of the 2000s   Urlacher  was selected to the Pro Bowl eight times and was first team All-Pro five times. In 13 seasons  according to pro-football-reference.com   he  amassed 1 354 tackles  41\u00bd sacks  22 interceptions  two touchdowns  90 passes defensed  11 forced fumbles and 15 fumble recoveries.\nPersonnel boss Mark Hatley made the decision to draft Urlacher  who had played safety in college. The Bears knew they were getting a player who could transform their defense but initially weren\u2019t sure how to deploy  him .\n\u201cWe knew we would like to play  him  at the mike (middle) linebacker  but the problem was  he  had been a safety  and we didn\u2019t want to stick  him  there right away and beat  him  up and lose  him  and ruin an excellent prospect \u201d defensive coordinator Greg Blache said. \u201cWe started  him  off at the sam (strong-side) linebacker position  where everything is coming at you from one direction in the traffic  and we played  him  at the mike in the nickel situation  where 95 percent of it was passing. So  he  was getting a feel for it but  he  wasn\u2019t getting in the heavy traffic with the guards coming on  him  and combination blocks \u2026 because it\u2019s a whole different beast when you\u2019re playing 12 to 15 yards deep as a safety and you move up to 5 yards from the line of scrimmage with the 300-pounders.\n\u201cWe knew we had something special and we knew  he  would be a guy who would be a hell of a player for a long  long time if we had some patience and were just judicious in how we approached it. Having (linebackers coach) Dale Lindsey there was a huge help because Dale had developed so many linebackers and he was a great voice in saying he had seen rush jobs when guys were put in situations they weren\u2019t quite ready to handle. It ended up working out really well just because we got him eased into it to the point where he was comfortable seeing it all happen.\u201d\nIt happened faster than anyone would have imagined  which in retrospect isn\u2019t surprising to anyone who was involved. Lindsey marveled at the amount of information  Urlacher  could process and then apply on the field. A lot of players  even really good ones  can lose the fine details when they move from the meeting room to the practice field and then into games  but  Urlacher  absorbed it all.\nWhen middle linebacker Barry Minter was sidelined with a back injury in the third week of the 2000 season  the Bears moved  Urlacher . They never again discussed where  he  was best suited to play or what  he  could handle.\n\u201c(Head coach) Dick Jauron said  \u2018Put  him  at the middle \u2019 \u201d Lindsey said. \u201cDick could see the big picture. Luckily for us  Brian was more than willing to learn the new position. It\u2019s nice when you have rare talent and a guy who wants to do it. That\u2019s the difference between the real great players \u2014 they want to do it and they\u2019ll do anything to be successful. He was like a sponge. You just kept giving him information and he absorbed it and would want more. The thing about the guys with the rare talent: They can do any damn thing you ask them. You can ask them the impossible and they can get it done. And Brian did it for us as a great middle linebacker.\u201d\nWhen the Bears signed massive defensive tackles Ted Washington and Keith Traylor in 2001   Urlacher  raised  his  game to a new level as the duo kept offensive linemen off of  him  and allowed  him  to make plays with  his  remarkable speed.\n\u201cThere are a lot of guys who can run fast in a straight line  but the athleticism  he  showed for a guy that size  off the charts \u201d Blache said.\nHe spearheaded the \u201cMonday Night Miracle\u201d at Arizona in 2006 with 25 tackles and a forced fumble that resulted in a touchdown.  Urlacher  had five interceptions and five sacks in 2007  a testament to  his  ability to do anything needed.\n Urlacher  was never very comfortable in the spotlight but always at ease around  his  teammates  which made  him  immensely popular.  He  treated the newest rookie the same way  he  did the most tenured veterans. When former teammate Todd Johnson became a high school coach in Sarasota  Fla.  he didn\u2019t have enough uniforms to dress all of his players.  Urlacher  provided new jerseys \u2014 home and away \u2014 for the entire roster and did so without seeking any attention  one of countless anecdotes of how  he  helped friends.", "output": "Bears great Brian Urlacher now a first ballot Pro Football Hall of Famer", "category": "Title Generation 1046.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, generate a short title of the document.
