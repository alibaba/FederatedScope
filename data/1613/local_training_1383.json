There was wisdom back then as to just what a piece of paper was worth. Now it's gotten to the point where the piece of paper has overcome real experience and common sense and often wrongs are righted by changing circumstances. Time to look at what is really needed in a college degree and teach what is needed and common sense and not have a bloated system with courses that don't pertain to majors. As a parent who wasn't fortunate enough to get a degree but sent a daughter through the system to receive her engineering degree I resent having paid for the little extras that were required and large classes taught by assistant professors.
