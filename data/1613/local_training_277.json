Cigarette smoking, which also produces chronic pulmonary inflammation, may be associated with iron accumulation in alveolar macrophages (AM). We have examined the total iron content in human AM and found it to be 43.0 +/- 7.7 (mean +/- SEM) and 12.8 +/- 1.3 nmol/1 X 10(6) cells (P less than 0.01) from smokers and nonsmokers, respectively. Because the higher iron content in smokers' macrophages may reflect increased internalization, the binding and uptake of iron-saturated transferrin was examined in cells from smokers and nonsmokers. However, no significant differences were found between the two groups. The smoking-related alteration in iron content may instead reflect differences in the fate of internalized iron. Iron internalized by AM as iron 59 initially bound to transferrin was distributed to a cytoplasmic, largely ferritin-associated, pool more slowly in smokers than in nonsmokers, during a 24-hour incubation in vitro. Significantly less newly internalized iron was returned to the culture medium by AM from smokers, which by 24 hours had released 11.0% +/- 3.7% of the initially internalized 59Fe compared with 36.0% +/- 2.3% for nonsmokers (P less than 0.01). The increased accumulation of iron by AM in the alveolar space of smokers may modulate hydroxyl radical production in the microenvironment of these cells.", "output": "Cells, Cultured, Emphysema, Hemin, Human, Inflammation, Iron, Macrophages, Pulmonary Alveoli, Smoking, Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S., Time Factors, Transferrin", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1247.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, generate a keyword (a noun phrase) that best describes the focus or contribution of the paper.

In one group, the alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors were blocked to eliminate neural and humoral adrenergic influences. In a second group, alpha-adrenergic receptors were stimulated to decrease O2 delivery by excessive vasoconstriction. In a third group, beta-adrenergic receptors were stimulated to increase O2 delivery. Whole-body and hindlimb muscle O2 uptake and vascular responses were measured during normoxic control, 15 or 30 min of severe hypoxia (9% O2 in N2), and 20 or 30 min of normoxic recovery, respectively. The whole-body O2 deficit and excess O2 uptake in recovery were partitioned into muscle and nonmuscle areas. The data showed that neural or humoral influences had little effect on the regional distribution of the total O2 deficit and O2 excess in recovery. The O2 deficit could be decreased somewhat by increasing delivery, but the amount of excess O2 used in recovery was unaffected. This suggested that the excess O2 use in recovery was more a function of an energy deficit during hypoxia and not an O2 deficit.", "output": "Animal, Anoxia, Dogs, Hindlimb, Isoproterenol, Methoxamine, Muscles, Oxygen Consumption, Receptors, Adrenergic, Alpha, Receptors, Adrenergic, Beta, Regional Blood Flow, Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S., Vasoconstriction.", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1247.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, generate a keyword (a noun phrase) that best describes the focus or contribution of the paper.

The effect of LH/hCG on luteal blood flow, however, is unknown. This work studies the effect of hCG on both luteal and ovarian blood flows at different stages of pseudopregnancy in adult female rats. Pseudopregnancy was induced by mating with sterile male rats. The length of pseudopregnancy was 13 +/- 1 days and, during this time, blood flow was measured by the injection of radioactive microspheres during anesthesia. At autopsy, the corpora lutea were identified and extirpated under a stereomicroscope. These, and the remaining ovary, were then counted for radioactivity and the blood flow was calculated. Progesterone levels were determined in plasma and ovarian tissues. Furthermore, the responsiveness of adenylate cyclase was tested in ovarian tissues at day 6 of pseudopregnancy. An intraarterial injection of hCG (50 IU) or vehicle (saline) was given 20 min before the blood flow determinations in anesthetized rats. The luteal blood flow was not changed by hCG on days 2, 6, and 11 of pseudopregnancy, whereas in the remaining ovary the blood flow increased more than 2-fold, thereby resulting in redistribution of the blood flow. Ten micrograms of NIH-LH-B9, tested at day 6 of pseudopregnancy, mimicked the effect of hCG. At day 6 of pseudopregnancy, hCG (50 IU) was given ip to conscious rats 200 min and 24 h before blood flow determinations. At 200 min after hCG there was a more pronounced redistribution of ovarian blood flow with a 45% reduction in luteal blood flow and a 4-fold increase in flow through the remaining ovary. LH as well as hCG doubled the progesterone content of the remaining ovary. In the corpora lutea an increased progesterone content was seen after 200 min of hCG exposure. At 24 h after hCG injection, all parameters had returned to control levels except that adenylate cyclase was nonresponsive. The increase in the total ovarian blood flow coincides with the increased steroidogenesis and these effects are likely due to release of metabolites and/or vasoactive substances. Despite this increase, the blood flow of the corpus luteum was not increased rendering vascular mechanisms unlikely as a part of the acute LH/hCG effects on corpus luteum of pseudopregnancy.", "output": "Adenyl Cyclase, Animal, Female, Gonadotropins, Chorionic, LH, Ovary, Progesterone, Pseudopregnancy, Rats, Regional Blood Flow, Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Time Factors.", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1247.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, generate a keyword (a noun phrase) that best describes the focus or contribution of the paper.

Rapid and subsequently persistent clinical improvement occurred in each patient; plasma dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and urinary 17-ketosteroid and cortisol excretion decreased soon after the initiation of treatment, subsequently remaining normal or nearly so throughout the treatment period. Urinary tetrahydro-11-deoxycortisol excretion increased significantly. Plasma cortisol levels decreased. Plasma ACTH levels did not change, and individual plasma ACTH and cortisol increments in response to CRH were comparable before and during treatment. The cortisol response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia improved in one patient and was restored to normal in another. The seven patients tested recovered normal adrenal suppressibility in response to a low dose of dexamethasone during ketoconazole treatment. Ketoconazole is effective for long term control of hypercortisolism of either pituitary or adrenal origin.

This behavior was associated with the onset of hypothermia, with deep body temperature falling by up to about 3 degrees C, usually to a new, steady level. Both the length of time spent in the cooler environment and the degree of the hypothermia produced increased with the partial pressure of N2O or N2 used. The effects of N2O on behavioral thermoregulation and body temperature were reversible. There was a correlation between anesthetic potency and the ability of both gases to alter thermoregulation, suggesting that the effect of these agents on thermoregulation was caused by the same molecular interactions as those which underlie anesthesia. Since both gases elicited changes in behavioral thermoregulation promoting rather than opposing the onset of hypothermia, it is concluded that they may have acted to lower the level at which deep body temperature was being regulated.", "output": "Anesthetics, Animal, Behavior, Animal, Body Temperature, Cold, Male, Mice, Nitrogen, Nitrous Oxide, Partial Pressure, Support, Non-U.S. Gov't.", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1247.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, generate a keyword (a noun phrase) that best describes the focus or contribution of the paper.

Peak inspiratory pressure differences between catheters allowed assessment of pressure gradients across three airway segments: lungs-larynx-retroepiglottal airway (esophageal-supralaryngeal pressure), hypopharynx (supralaryngeal-oropharynx pressure), and transpalatal airway (oropharynx-nasopharynx pressure). In five patients, hypopharyngeal obstruction was present, and in four patients no hypopharyngeal obstruction existed. In these four patients the site of obstruction was located at the level of the palate. In a given subject, the site of obstruction was the same during repeated measurements.

In six patients with the hyperkalemic variety, furosemide failed to lower urine pH below 5.5 and resulted in a blunted increase in K+ excretion, thereby suggesting that a normal transtubular voltage in the CCT could not be generated in such patients. In five patients with classic RTA, furosemide failed to lower urine pH below 5.5, but K+ excretion increased normally. The increase in K+ excretion indicated that a normal transtubular voltage in the CCT could be generated, while the inability to lower urine pH denotes the presence of a proton pump defect involving the CCT. In two patients with classic RTA, furosemide resulted in both a normal fall in urine pH and an increase in K+ excretion, thereby indicating that the CCT was normal in regards to both proton pump function and in its ability to generate a normal transtubular voltage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "output": "Acidosis, Renal Tubular, Amiloride, Comparative Study, Female, Furosemide, Human, Hydrogen, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Hyperkalemia, Kidney Tubules, Kidney Tubules, Collecting, Male, Potassium, Sulfates, Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S..", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1247.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, generate a keyword (a noun phrase) that best describes the focus or contribution of the paper.

Only minor similarity is found outside this catalytic domain, as expected for receptors that have different ligand specificities and generate different biological signals. The EGF receptor is a single polypeptide chain but the insulin receptor consists of distinct alpha and beta subunits that function as an alpha 2 beta 2 heterotetrameric receptor complex. Provoked by this major structural difference in two receptors that carry out parallel functions, we have designed a chimaeric receptor molecule comprising the extracellular portion of the insulin receptor joined to the transmembrane and intracellular domains of the EGF receptor to investigate whether one ligand will activate the tyrosine kinase domain of the receptor for the other ligand. We show here that the EGF receptor kinase domain of the chimaeric protein, expressed transiently in simian cells, is activated by insulin binding. This strongly suggests that insulin and EGF receptors employ closely related or identical mechanisms for signal transduction across the plasma membrane.", "output": "Chimera, DNA, Human, Plasmids, Protein-Tyrosine Kinase, Receptors, Epidermal Growth Factor-Urogastrone, Receptors, Insulin, SV40 Virus", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1247.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, generate a keyword (a noun phrase) that best describes the focus or contribution of the paper.

R rats showed reduced growth, slower increase in plasma creatinine, lower mortality rate, and less histological renal damage than L rats. 2) Two types of CHO restriction, low glucose (R1 rats) or low starch (R2 rats) were compared to \"ad lib\" feeding (L1 rats) in adult rats (initial weight: 130 g). Growth was identically reduced in R1 and R2 rats. Mean plasma creatinine levels at week four was lower in R1 than in L1 rats. The overall rate mortality was higher for L1 and R2 than in R1 rats (79%, 81%, 53%) but included deaths from other causes than renal failure. Actuarial survival excluding these deaths was 27%, 83% and 10% in L1, R1 and R2 rats, respectively.

A stochastic model was set up to investigate the predictions of current BMU theory. Each of 100 trabecular \"thicknesses\" was drawn from the appropriate normal distribution using a pseudorandom number generator. Each day, each of its two surfaces when quiescent was assumed to have a 1:900 chance of initiating a remodelling cycle. Resorption (active, 12 days; reversal phase, 27 days) was followed by formation (94 +/- 35 days) and resulted in BMU balance when resorption depth was 36.8 +/- 9.2 micron. Fenestration (thickness less than 0) was assumed to lead to permanent loss of the trabecula. The original model unrealistically increased its mean trabecular thickness as thin trabeculae were lost. This was corrected by assuming that thin trabeculae had greater osteoblastic stimulation and a consequent tendency to thicken, perhaps due to higher mechanical loading. Over 20 years, 14% of trabeculae were lost when the BMU balance was exact and the distribution of trabecular thicknesses was unchanged. About one-half of fenestrations were due to deeper-than-average resorption cavities developing in thin trabeculae, and the remainder to coincident remodelling on both surfaces. A 10% fall in osteoblast lifespan resulted in an additional 36.7% loss of trabecular bone volume and mean trabecular thickness fell to 83.1 micron, compatible with Courpron's data. Simulating more rapid mechanisms of bone loss, approximately 50% of trabeculae could be lost after ten years by the arrest of bone formation; the doubling of resorption depth with unchanged bone formation; and a doubling in the rate of initiation of new BMUs with unchanged bone formation rate, all three followed by complete recovery of BMU balance after only two years. In each case, mean trabecular thickness fell only transiently but trabeculae continued to be lost after recovery.

Some clinically normal males--transmitting males--are known to carry and transmit the fragile X mutation and yet show no cytogenetic expression in lymphocytes. Normal males with no family history of X-linked mental retardation express the site only rarely. When the fragile X chromosome from affected males is isolated in a rodent genetic background by somatic cell hybridization, the level of expression is similar to that seen in lymphocytes under Td stress. Here we show that X chromosomes from two transmitting males and two normal control males, all of which were fragile X negative in lymphocytes or lymphoblasts, could be made to express the fragile site in hybrids, although at levels that were below those seen in hybrids from affected males. Furthermore, transmitting males could be differentiated from normal males by their significantly higher expression rates when hybrids were exposed to caffeine before cytogenetic harvest. One male chimpanzee also showed low level expression in hybrid cells. These data suggest that the hybrid system lowers the threshold for fragile X expression, a fragile site at Xq27 may be present on all human and chimpanzee X chromosomes and constitutes a previously unrecognized common fragile site and the hybrid system with caffeine post-treatment can distinguish between the common Xq27 fragile site of control males, the occult mutant fragile site of a transmitting male, and the fully expressed fragile site of an affected male with XLMR.

An area proximal to the medial malleolus was found to provide a stable, relatively flat, and easily penetrable location for needle placement.

We therefore used a new mathematical cineradiographic method during catheter mapping to compute the position of left ventricular arrhythmogenic sites relative to three anatomic reference points: the centers of aortic and mitral valve ostia and the left ventricular apex. To enable the surgeon to identify the position of the computed sites, a wire skeleton (one for each patient) representing a single or multiple arrhythmogenic site(s) relative to the anatomic reference points was constructed. This wire skeleton was inserted into the left ventricular cavity during surgery. Side branches of the device indicated preoperatively localized arrhythmogenic sites. Results in eight consecutive patients were compared with those of intraoperative simultaneous mapping of 64 endocardial sites. Sixteen morphologically distinct monomorphic ventricular tachycardias were mapped by catheter and 15 by intraoperative mapping. In 12 ventricular tachycardias an identical morphology was recorded during both techniques. The distance between arrhythmogenic sites localized with both methods was 1 cm or less in 11 of these 12 ventricular tachycardias and 2 cm in one ventricular tachycardia. These results indicate that endocardial catheter mapping combined with wire skeleton representation of computed positions of arrhythmogenic sites is reliable for guiding surgical therapy of ventricular tachycardia and since some of the ventricular tachycardias were inducible only during either preoperative or intraoperative mapping, both techniques have an additive value.

Here we show the existence of bent DNA at a yeast autonomously replicating sequence (ARS1), a putative replication origin. The bent DNA has been localized to a 40-55 base pair (bp) segment and contains six (A)3-5 stretches (that is, six poly(A) stretches, three to five nucleotides in length) phased approximately every 10.5 bp. This region contains a DNA binding site for a yeast protein factor. This site lies at the 3' end of the TRP1 gene, in a region devoid of nucleosomes, and is positioned 80 bp away from the ARS consensus sequence; removal of this region impairs ARS function in vivo. The bent DNA may be involved in transcription termination or the prevention of nucleosome assembly in this region.", "output": "Base Sequence, Binding Sites, DNA, Nucleic Acid Conformation, Poly A, Replicon, Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S., Yeasts", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1247.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, generate a keyword (a noun phrase) that best describes the focus or contribution of the paper.

The binding of MAb 4F2 to human adenomatous dPTCs resulted in a marked [53.8 +/- 7.9% (+/- SEM)] reduction in low calcium (Ca)-stimulated PTH secretion to levels equivalent to those in cell suppressed by high extracellular Ca (1.5 mM). Typically, these functional effects were optimal at antibody dilutions of 1:10(4) to 1:10(5). Cell viability was confirmed at the conclusion of each experiment by trypan blue exclusion (greater than 90-95%) and cell surface immunofluorescence. Parallel studies using the Ca-sensitive dye Quin-2 showed that inhibition of PTH secretion in 4F2-treated cells was associated with a concomitant increase in cytosolic Ca (Cai) of 188% in 0.5 mM Ca; these values also approached Cai levels in control cells incubated in high Ca. Mab controls, P3 X 63, which do not bind to dPTCs, and Mab LC7-2, which recognizes a different epitope of the same antigen as 4F2 on dPTCs, did not alter PTH secretion or Cai. Immunoprecipitation of 125I-labeled parathyroid cell extracts with MAb 4F2 demonstrated proteins with mol wt of approximately 145, 85, and 45 under nonreducing conditions and 85 and 45 kilodaltons after reduction with 5% mercaptoethanol. These studies suggest that 1) Mab-4F2 binding to its cell surface antigen inhibits PTH secretion by human adenomatous parathyroid cells in vitro; 2) the alterations in secretory function could be related to by an attendant increase in Cai; 3) the 4F2 antigen on dPTCs is a heterodimeric protein of (approximately) 85K and 45K; and 4) the 4F2 antigen may be an important component of the Ca-sensing and/or signal-transducing mechanism in this cell.", "output": "Adenoma, Antibodies, Monoclonal, Antigens, Surface, Binding Sites, Antibody, Calcium, Cytosol, Human, Immunochemistry, Parathyroid Glands, Parathyroid Hormones, Parathyroid Neoplasms, Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S..", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1247.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, generate a keyword (a noun phrase) that best describes the focus or contribution of the paper.

Some evidence has suggested an action on insulin receptors, but a postbinding or postreceptor effect has also been reported. As hydrogen peroxide acts at a postbinding site to stimulate glucose transport, studies were carried out in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts to determine whether corticosteroids would inhibit hydrogen peroxide-induced glucose transport. In this cell type, both insulin and hydrogen peroxide produced a marked increase in glucose transport after a 30-min incubation. The increase produced by hydrogen peroxide, as well as insulin, was inhibited by previous incubation of the cells with dexamethasone. These findings give further support to the conclusion that dexamethasone has effects on glucose transport at a postbinding site. As changes in membrane lipids influence the movement and/or activity of glucose transporters, and dexamethasone alters membrane lipids, dexamethasone-induced changes in the lipids of the plasma membrane may be important in the mediation of the steroid effect upon glucose transport.", "output": "Animal, Biological Transport, Cell Line, Deoxyglucose, Dexamethasone, Glucose, Hydrogen Peroxide, Mice, Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S..", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1247.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, generate a keyword (a noun phrase) that best describes the focus or contribution of the paper.

The mechanism of this \"extrarenal potassium adaptation\" is not known. To explore the role of potassium depletion in this process, we studied rats adapted to either a high potassium (HK) or control (C) diet. When dietary potassium was withdrawn, urinary potassium losses in HK rats greatly exceeded those in C rats for at least two days, leading to greater potassium depletion in HK than C animals. A smaller increment in plasma potassium in HK compared to C rats was seen only after prolonged fasting preceded nephrectomy and acute potassium loading. Correction of potassium depletion incurred during fasting abolished extrarenal potassium adaptation. We conclude: after withdrawal of dietary potassium, urinary potassium losses are much greater in HK than in C rats; if the duration of dietary potassium deprivation is sufficient, these urinary potassium losses will cause potassium-adapted animals to paradoxically become more potassium depleted than controls; and this paradoxical potassium depletion may be responsible for extrarenal potassium adaptation.", "output": "Adaptation, Physiological, Animal, Comparative Study, Diet, Fasting, Kidney, Male, Nephrectomy, Potassium, Potassium Deficiency, Rats, Rats, Inbred Strains, Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Time Factors.", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1247.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, generate a keyword (a noun phrase) that best describes the focus or contribution of the paper.

The number of measure points was 113 in the nephrotic syndrome and 92 in renal failure. In both groups blood volume was normal at normal extracellular fluid volume (ECFV). Elevation of ECFV to 300% of normal in the nephrotic syndrome occurred with only a modest elevation of blood volume (NS). Elevation of ECFV to 200% of normal in the patients with renal failure was attended by a major elevation of blood volume (P less than 0.01). Reduction of ECFV to about 10% below normal was accompanied by parallel blood volume reduction in both groups. Blood pressure was comparable at normohydration, and increased to clearly hypertensive levels only in the renal failure group with increasing ECFV and blood volume (P less than 0.01). No major blood pressure difference was observed between normal and subnormal hydration, but hypotension was observed twice in the nephrotic group. Apparently, patients with severe hypoproteinemia due to the nephrotic syndrome are generally able to preserve their blood volume even when free of edema. However, their blood volume is not elevated in overhydration, in contrast to patients with renal failure who are normoproteinemic.

Evidence of stem bending was present on examination of the femoral implant, and marked wear of the acetabular cup was noted. The pathologic evaluation of removed calcar bone and cement revealed a histiocytic mass invading the bone. Intracellular and extracellular polymethylene debris was noted within the invasive mass. Evidence of fragmented methylmethacrylate cement was also present. The bone-cement interface in the excised calcar region contained segments that showed active bone remodelling around the cement without an interposed membrane. It is possible that this case of calcar resorption began with histiocytic activation and recruitment by polyethylene wear debris followed by active bone lysis. The process may be perpetuated by the fragmentation of cement, as motion occurred at the calcar bone-cement interface, and may represent an extreme example of a process occurring in cases of calcar resorption in general.", "output": "Bone Cements, Bone Resorption, Case Report, Follow-Up Studies, Hip Joint, Hip Prosthesis, Human, Male, Middle Age, Osteoarthritis, Reoperation.", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1247.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, generate a keyword (a noun phrase) that best describes the focus or contribution of the paper.

During the slow rise Pa(t) and Pv(t) tended to converge and become concave upward as the volume of blood in the lungs increased. We compared the dynamic vascular volume vs. pressure curves obtained after VO with the static volume vs. pressure curves obtained by dye dilution. The slope of the static curve (the static compliance, Cst) was always larger than the slope of the dynamic curve (the dynamic compliance, Cdyn). In addition, the Cdyn decreased with increasing blood flow rate. When venous occlusion (VO) was followed after a short time interval by arterial occlusion (AO) such that the lobe was isovolumic, both Pa and Pv fell with time to a level that was below either pressure at the instant of AO. In an attempt to explain these observations a compartmental model was constructed in which the hemodynamic resistance and vascular compliance were volume dependent and the vessel walls were viscoelastic. These features of the model could account for the convergence and upward concavity of the Pa and Pv curves after VO and the pressure relaxation in the isovolumic state after AO, respectively. According to the model analysis, the difference between Cst and Cdyn and the flow dependence of Cdyn are due to wall viscosity and volume dependence of compliance, respectively. Model analysis also suggested ways of evaluating changes in the viscoelasticity of the lobar vascular bed. Hypoxic vasoconstriction that increased total vascular resistance also decreased Cst and Cdyn and appeared to increase the vessel wall viscosity.", "output": "Animal, Arteries, Blood Flow Velocity, Blood Pressure, Blood Volume, Dogs, Elasticity, Lung, Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S., Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S., Vascular Resistance, Vasoconstriction, Veins, Venous Pressure.", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1247.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, generate a keyword (a noun phrase) that best describes the focus or contribution of the paper.

Consumption of fried foods and sweets decreased with the level of education while fiber intake increased. More skilled and technical employees than professional employees consumed milk products. Less than half of any employee group consumed excessive amounts of coffee or colas. Few study participants consumed alcohol. Very few members of any group consumed meals away from home five or more times per week. Less than half of all employees believed that they received enough exercise; one-third or less exercised regularly. A greater percentage of technical employees than of the other two employee groups expressed interest in improving health through physical fitness and class sessions.", "output": "Adult, Attitude to Health, Diet, Exertion, Female, Health Education, Human, Life Style, Male, Middle Age, Physical Fitness, Questionnaires, Self Assessment (Psychology), Skilled Nursing Facilities", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1247.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, generate a keyword (a noun phrase) that best describes the focus or contribution of the paper.

Mouse thyrotropic tumor tissue, or pituitaries from euthyroid or hypothyroid mice, were incubated with D-[2-3H]Man, homogenized, and incubated in the presence or absence of pH 3 buffer to dissociate heterodimers. Highly enriched TSH beta-subunits, or TSH heterodimers, were obtained using anti-TSH beta serum and free alpha-subunits were subsequently obtained using anti-LH alpha-serum. High Man units released by endoglycosidase H were analyzed by paper chromatography. At 1 and 3 h oligosaccharides with 8 or 9 Man residues predominated in all subunits. In all three tissue types, units with 9 Man tended to accumulate in TSH beta-subunits, whereas Man-trimming from Man9GlcNAc to Man8GlcNAc proceeded more rapidly in TSH alpha-subunits, and in free alpha-subunits. The rate of TSH beta-subunit processing was also a function of tissue type; the rate in euthyroid pituitary tissue equaled that in tumor tissue and was greater than that in hypothyroid pituitary tissue, suggesting that processing may be physiologically regulated. Hypothyroid calf serum slowed TSH alpha-subunit processing in euthyroid pituitaries. Thus, the previously reported slower processing of Man9GlcNAc to Man8GlcNAc in heterodimers as compared to free alpha-subunits is in large part due to accumulation of Man9GlcNAc in TSH beta-subunits.", "output": "Animal, Carbohydrate Sequence, Glycoproteins, Glycosylation, Hypothyroidism, Kinetics, Macromolecular Systems, Mice, Pituitary Gland, Pituitary Neoplasms, Protein Processing, Post-Translational, Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S., Thyrotropin", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1247.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, generate a keyword (a noun phrase) that best describes the focus or contribution of the paper.

Even in disorders that primarily affect the left ventricle, the once-considered-passive conduit has proved essential for maintenance of normal cardiac output. In coronary artery disease, the function of the right ventricle is affected by both its circulation and the after-load placed on it by dysfunction of the left ventricle. In congestive heart failure, right ventricular function relates to functional capacity, whereas left ventricular function does not, and right ventricular ejection fraction is a useful prognostic guide in these patients. In mitral and aortic valvular disease, the role of the right ventricle is only now becoming evident, and the precise interplay of all factors has yet to be explained. In systemic hypertension, it is likely that the pulmonary circulation is affected by the same humoral factors that elevate systemic pressures.", "output": "Coronary Disease, Heart Failure, Congestive, Heart Valve Diseases, Heart Ventricle, Human, Hypertension", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1247.json"}]
