Whoever the door girl is?... get a new one. Shes like the teacher on ferris buller. Server was on point Angel was his name. Above and beyond. Food was not worth the price for sure., Review_2: I have been here 20 times and the staff from greater, wait staff, bartenders, managers Have been excellent busy slow always the same great service. Have had orders not made to my request and instantly fixed, mangers always come by asking how everything is. The food is excellent, Review_3: It's Olive Garden and it's in Surprise, so it's always busy. I've always had decent service and good tasting food. If I have my choice, I'm always going to choose a less chain place, but it's not bad in a pinch., Review_4: I'm currently eating a Olive Garden and I can honestly say Trevor, our waiter, is wonderful! He has been making sure that our drinks are full and that everything is tasting great! Definitely coming back because of him! Keep up the great work Trevor!!!!, Review_5: This location is busy. I was happy with the prompt service and good food. I have visited the other locations in the past 75th McDowell and Estrella parkway and McDowell and this location is by far the the friendliest. Next time I feel like soup and salad without ghetto or cold treatment I will definitely stop at this location., Review_6: The host, our waitress and the food were all great! Though they sat us in the back where there was an uncomfortable smell, I usually come here and never have that problem so I'll come back again but yeah, my overall experience was good and i love the soups, the salads and the fettuccine!, Review_7: I, like I'm sure every other American, love Olive Garden. I haven't experienced anything different about this location compared to another except the wait times. The wait times are almost always 45 minutes minimum and for me it's just not worth it., Review_8: We went early on a thursday night. Our party of 4 was seated immediately. Service was fast and we all liked our entries. Everything tasted fine, hot, good portions. Wine was good. I will return, its a decent alternative to Carrabas.", "output": "This Olive Garden is always busy because of its location, but despite that, the staff is wonderful and friendly. Expect long wait times when it gets very crowded. This place has great soups and salad, and the wine is excellent as well. The food comes fresh, hot, and in large portions., Service is fast and the portions are well sized. Customer service is at a high level, with the host, wait staff, bartenders and managers being quick to remedy problems. Orders are fixed quickly to the customers liking if needed. Seating can sometimes take a while depending on the night. Value can be low on some items, but the flavor is usually high., This particular branch of Olive Garden is usually very busy due to its location and this makes for longer wait times. Food tastes great and is just about as good as at other (Olive Garden) locations, but with friendlier and more impressive staff. Overall great place for a meal if one is not in too much of a hurry.", "category": "Summarization 1299.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a set of reviews from Amazon and Yelp.

I'm using it with 16 AWG wires (they say they are 14 but I know better than that). It should fit 14 and maybe even 12 AWG. I'm not using banana jacks., Review_2: Cant give it 5 stars because the mounting screws that come with it are poor quality and will strip easily. Do yourself a favor, head to the hardware store and get the # 6 - 32 1 'combination machine screws and throw out the ones that come with this product. The white trim screws are OK, but not great., Review_3: cost much more from local retailers plus is a better product. some of the newer designs suck. plastic inserts don't try it if it says easier dont't buy it. this product works on old school. some times that's the best way. take a little longer to instal but no going back for loss wires, Review_4: This is OK product. looks good and easy to install.Cons: Cover is not a standard size and you probably wont be able to replace it. In addition it does not flush everything completely (not deep enough) and there is a small gap left between the wall and the plate., Review_5: All the screw heads were painted shut. I had to dig them all out before I could screw them in. The rest of the plate is ok but I didn't enjoy spending a bunch of time digging the slots out of the screws. I'd recommend going with something else., Review_6: Bought five for my 5.1. Installed into the boxes in the wall well. 4 stars for having a slight gap between the wall and the plate after install. I only notice it at slight angels. Jacks are made well wires attached well., Review_7: Easy installation and looking nice. Much cheaper than brand product at local store. However, it doesn't look as nice as the brand ones either. I suspect the connectors are made of poorly gold-plated bruss or even other metal. But for my purpose and for the price, it is OK., Review_8: Came individually packaged, with mounting screws. The backing plate is plastic, but sturdy enough. Plastic is great for me as I live near the ocean and corrosion can happen. Great quality. Great price. Much cheaper than local home improvement stores.", "output": "This mount is cheap, installs easily, and works well for most applications. It looks good, and the plastic is sturdy. However, the included screws are of suspect quality and may need to be replaced, and the back plate doesn't fit snugly against the wall. Overall, good for the price., This mounting device is a better price than most. There are some quality control issues, such as bad screws and fitment issues between the wall and the plate. It does its job, but there are better versions, albeit at a higher price. It is recommended if cost is more important than having the highest quality., The product has looks and ease of installation. It is less expensive than buying locally. However, the screws are not of the best quality and #6-32 1 combination machine screws are recommended. It also leaves a gap between the wall and the plate. Nevertheless, the purchase is recommended.", "category": "Summarization 1299.json"}]
