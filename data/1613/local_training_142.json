All the time.  She\u2019s also rude as fuck.  Like just mean spirited.   There have been customer complaints about her.  \n\nThe rumors are that she\u2019s been fooling around with our store manager.  There\u2019s no proof of this.  But this past week she was promoted to assistant manager.  \n\nShe\u2019s already letting the power go to her head.  She made the schedule giving herself all the easiest times.

Katy told her no and that a lot of things are gonna be different now. \n\nThere\u2019s no way Katy was promoted for her work.  It\u2019s just not possible.  Everyone hate her because we\u2019re all constantly picking up her slack.  She\u2019s rude to customers.  It just doesn\u2019t make sense that she was promoted.  \n\nThe district manager is coming next week and a couple other employees want to pull him aside and talk to him about her.

I'm not a total asshole.**\n\nI'm an 18 year old college student with autism/asd. It's not too severe, and I'm able to bumble and stumble through my day normally. One thing that sort of sets me off, though, is isolated loud noises. Ambient noise like a crowded mall or heavy traffic is fine, but things like a baby screaming or a dog barking put me on edge.\n\nAt the beginning of the year I tried living on-campus, but the lack of privacy and random noise ultimately drove me back home. Things are better here, but they're not great. Moreover, they're beginning to unravel a bit. \n\nWe have two dogs, used to have three. They have their own little yard to do their business in before being let inside. Ever since the second one died, it seems like the third dog has learned to be as loud and obnoxious as possible to be let back inside.\n\nWe also have a wonderful grandmother who lives with us. She, of course, is becoming a bit senile with age. But she's not meek, she's a strong fighting mfer at heart. Unfortunately this means that when she misplaces something, she gets paranoid and shouts at people who she believes \"took it\".\n\nAnd in the spring, we'll be fostering a teenager for the first (and supposedly only) time. He will be in court-ordered residential therapy for the next three months before being released to us, probably in March. I was supportive of the rest of the family making this decision, but it's really begun to sink in that this will undoubtedly be rough. \n\nI try, and mostly succeed, at bottling up my agitation over small things like these, since I'd like to think I'm a well behaved son. But I already have so many other things I bottle up, because I'm too afraid and guilty to bother other people with it. And it gets damaging. I resent myself for not being able to take it easily, but that's the way it is.\n\nOn an entirely different storyline, my parents decided a while ago that they would get me an apartment close to school for my sophomore year. I'm currently commuting 45 minutes each way. Of course, I'm incredibly grateful for this, and I'm sure they're getting a kick out of me looking up all these properties relentlessly (it's something I've always been fixated on, some aspies do trains, others do real estate). But I'd really like to move over spring break in March instead of in June or July like originally planned. \n\nIt just makes more sense - I'd be out as the foster kid moves in, it would be during a semester break, and I'd have a 10 minute drive. They'd have more room for the foster kid, and we'd all be less stressed. But I can't help but feel selfish for even asking. It's not entirely about the money; they make enough in a day to pay the rent, and they got a refund for the dorm this semester. I'd be willing to help them pay it regardless. But I feel ungrateful, and I hate hurting other people. \n\nSo am I a spoiled ungrateful asshole that's trying to take more than he's been given, or am I being reasonable in asking?\n\n*TLDR: Autistic college student commuting long way from home.

I just recently learned my anger has become an issue, and a lot of it for the past month has been randomly directed at her. She\u2019s an angel, did nothing wrong, and took it all without a word. A couple of weeks ago she finally said to me \u201cI\u2019m not sure I can do this anymore\u201d which was a massive eye opener for me, and I began to work on trying meditation and other forms of anger control until I could get on some anti depressant medication. \n\n\nBut back to the story. The other day I noticed she was on her phone, like a lot, and at one point I had glanced over and she was sending pictures, not nudes just general selfies etc, to some guy with a nickname on her phone. And his response included the word \u201cprincess\u201d so I asked her about it. She immediately got self defensive and began to raise her voice, to which I did as well and things got a little heated and I said \u201chey look, can we talk about this like adults instead of screaming at each other?\u201d So we did. Her response to the so called \u201cflirting\u201d was that it was \u201cHelping my self confidence issues, and it\u2019s not like I\u2019m seeing him in person. He\u2019s just a customer from work who gave me his number and I decided to text him because why not\u201d \n\n\nI take issue to this, and I said so, to which she HAD called me an asshole, and has now taken off from the apartment for the night.

I don\u2019t think she\u2019s coming back home tonight because she took her laptop and everything with her. \n\n\nWhich begs the question, AM I the asshole? Because I honestly don\u2019t know.

I\u2019ve got a weird one today.\n\nPosted on r/relationships as well because I both want to know what should be done and also want to know if I\u2019m the asshole here. I'll refer to my little brother as John.\n\nLong, sorry. See the bottom for a TL;DR\n\n\nBackground: me [F 22] and my little brother [M 19] live at home with our parents [MF 62]. I am attending a nearby university for a one-year grad school program and working on the weekends. John graduated high school a few months ago, dropped out of community college, and is trying to get a job in IT. He has had two 3-month positions and has not searched for a new one when this job ends in three weeks. John aspires to be a Twitch streamer. My parents both work \u2013 my mother being a nurse and my father being a contractor. It may also be important to note that we all have mental illness problems in my family. My parents, myself, and my older brother all cope well and use medication for various forms of depression. John has GAD, depression, and some unknown mood disorder. He is not compliant with his medications.\n\n\nMy family has always had cats. My two brothers (28 and 19) are allergic to cats, but my older brother adopted a cat before he knew he was allergic. Over time they acclimated to our cat and had no problems unless they rubbed their faces in her fur. Our first cat was killed by a loose dog a few years ago and we adopted another. When my older brother moved out he took that cat with him. Since then, we (my parents and I) have missed having an animal in the house.\n\n\nMy father grew up with all sorts of cats, dogs, and farm animals. He loves them all. My mother grew up with a dog. She\u2019s not so much a cat person, but mainly because the cats we\u2019ve had haven\u2019t been lap cats, which she values. As I said, they miss having an animal presence. Now that we\u2019re grown, my parents decided they wanted a dog. They\u2019re getting older (62) and haven\u2019t had a dog in 35 years due to my brothers\u2019 allergies. We had no idea that they\u2019ve been wanting one for decades. We were all happy that they were finally able to do something for themselves after caring for us for years. They adopted a beautiful, 9-year-old, 80lb mutt named Hank. He thought he was a lap dog, never barked, and was so chill. Within a few days, however, they had to return him to the shelter. John has a phobia of dogs due to prior experience, however, he said he loved Hank and didn\u2019t mind having a dog. John was apparently so afraid of Hank that he wouldn\u2019t leave his room. I can\u2019t blame him for not knowing how it would affect him. Still, this surprised us as he loved Hank at the shelter and agreed happily. Maybe he was just trying to make our parents happy. Regardless, they were devastated.\n\n\nNow, a few years later, we\u2019ve been discussing getting a cat. I unintendedly brought up the conversation but showing my parents pictures of cute cats and constantly saying \u201cI love cats\u201d. As hard as it is to believe, I was not planning or hoping to get a cat. I will only be living with my parents for another year and I wouldn\u2019t want to dump a cat on them. That would be selfish. I can still vicariously enjoy them. Apparently, my comments made them consider it, and they called a family meeting. Everyone agreed, including John, although he was rather apathetic. So we went to the shelter, fell in love with a 6-year-old bonded pair, and started filling out the paperwork. John found a tiny 4-month old kitten that he wanted, but my parents said no because honestly it will probably outlive them. At this point, a woman with a tiny, yapping purse dog came in. John's anxiety shot up so he went outside. We were signing the last form when he came back and said he doesn\u2019t want a cat. My father and I were, again, heartbroken.\n\n\nJohn's reasoning for not wanting a cat:\n\n1.\tHe walks fast and is afraid of spooking the cat.\n\n2.\tAnimals make him anxious.\n\n3.\tHe does not want the cat to chew his computer cables.\n\n4.\tHe\u2019s allergic.\n\n\n2 and 4 are valid. 1 is understandable but not necessarily a real issue. 3 I would consider bogus. A cat is not a chinchilla. \n\n\nHere\u2019s the kicker. Last week he changed his mind. He told us, expecting us to praise him and thank him. We did not. We planned to go to the shelter yesterday. John called my older brother and complained, saying he feels outnumbered. After this comment, we had another meeting. My parents tried calmly to explain why they want a cat and he exploded (his honest-to-goodness usual reaction to being told \u201cno\u201d). My mother decided it\u2019s not worth it. She feels like saying yes to one is saying no to the other.\n\n\nNaturally, I\u2019m mad over all of this. John has a history of being extremely emotionally manipulative towards my parents. He\u2019s typically gotten what he wants. \n\n\nSo AITA here? I don\u2019t know what the appropriate response is. It\u2019s 3-against-1 but is it acceptable to overlook the concerns of one family member for the wants of another? That seems wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR My adult brother does not want my family to have a cat. The rest of us do.

Me and many others made a lot of good memories in our time there. Eventually the owner had to shut down the server. The owner was never popular among the players as he was rarely online and the volunteer moderators pretty much ran the show. The owner also had set up a webpage and forum for the server on Enjin.com, a social media platform intended for WoW guilds, Minecraft servers, gaming communities etc. The Enjin page for this particular Minecraft server had about 1500 members, including many friends that I haven't spoken to in years.\n\nFast forward to recently. The owner hasn't used his Minecraft or Enjin accounts in five years. A few friends and I, who met on this server in 2012, have a Discord group dedicated to bringing together the old playerbase and giving us a new place to talk.\n\n**This is where the drama starts.** One of the guys in the Discord has some experience in hacking and suggested that we try to access the owner's Enjin account. With admin account access, we could post the link to the Discord on the site homepage and send an announcement to all site members, giving them an email notification. This way we'd get many old friends to join our group. We figured the owner wouldn't even notice his account and his website were taken (liberated) from him, as the guy had been totally MIA for years and didn't respond to our messages, so we figured he just didn't care about his old server anymore.\n\nSo we go for it. My friend does most of the work, since he knows what to do, but I help him every step of the way. We try to uncover information about the owner: if we find an email, we can search it in a giant database of leaked info from website breaches and see the associated passwords. After one or two hours of trying, we find a password that works. We log in to the account. We add an update to the homepage, and send the mass message. We change the owner's account email and password.\n\nThe next day, the owner joins our Discord group and sends me a DM. He tells me he knows I was involved and demands his account back. He says he's uncomfortable that we were able to learn so much of his personal information, which included his real name and his email login. I didn't want to comply, I wanted to keep the account, so I lie. I claim I didn't participate in the hacking, I don't have access to his account, but I know who did it and I encouraged it to happen, so I'll talk to this unnamed person and ask him to give up the account details. I immediately forward the owner's messages to my friend. He thinks we should give the account back. He contacts the owner by himself and tells him the changed login info. The owner then logs in, deletes \"his\" post on the homepage, and deletes his account. I feel bad about what I did, mostly about not giving the account back when asked to. However, the owner was being stubborn for years and I just wanted to reunite the community.\n\nAITA?", "output": "AUTHOR", "category": "Ethics Classification 1125.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, identify who is wrong here.

We have a 3 month old who is the only grand child on my side of the family, and the only one in the state on hers, so we have a lot of family looking to come and visit frequently.  Our families live 1-2 hours away so it\u2019s usually more like day visits instead of quick visits.  \n\nObviously, with me working full time and my wife staying home with a baby who needs almost constant care (along with a 9 month old puppy) and also working a part time remote job, certain house keeping items can fall through the cracks and we get behind.  I will point out that we do keep a clean house, I come home from work most nights and tackle either dishes or laundry, and we pick up the clutter and vacuum pretty regularly.\n\nOur mindset is that if family members come to visit for the day on a weekend, we expect them to do more than just hold the baby, but actually help out by maybe doing the dishes, switching laundry to the dryer, taking the dog for a walk, etc just so we can lean on their support for a small break from all the stuff that piles up.  Some family members are super giving with their time/efforts and are happy to help, but my wife\u2019s mom and step dad basically expect to come and hold the baby without doing anything else.  We have to specifically ask them to do things if we want them to help, and if they do it it\u2019s usually with a pretty snarky/put off attitude.\n\nThis was capped off last night when they came to babysit while we went to my company\u2019s Christmas party, and as we were all dressed up and heading out the door, my MIL called out to my wife for help because our son had a poopy diaper and she made us change it before leaving. It\u2019s a small thing but it made my wife confront them about not being helpful when they come to visit, and her mom responded that \u201cthat\u2019s not what grandmas are for\u201d and that if we need help we should just hire people for it (they are pretty well off, but we don\u2019t have money for a nanny or anything.)\n\nSo we really want to know, are our expectations too high for support from family when they come visit, or is it fair to expect some pitching in when they\u2019re here for several hours/a whole day?

They kissed and had oral sex but my sis swears that they didn't do more than that, I, as bad as it is, told my mum about it in the morning today, she is absolutely devastated and broken to say the least, she doesn't know how to process at all.\n\nWhen I finished explaining everything, my mom started crying and ran out, after that my sister came out of her room ( also crying) and repeatedly tried to justify what she did, I was so angry that I slapped her to the face.\nMy sister then spit me in the face and returned to her room.

I fully take responsibility for certain parts in this whole thing where I know it\u2019s gonna be a hard YTA. But aside from judgment, I guess I also want to make the whole story (or at least my side of it) known. \n\nFreshman year of college, in another country, I (24F) met another expat from the U.S. We\u2019ll call him ex-bff (24M). I attempted to befriend him, having the expat thing in common and all. But he behaved dickishly towards me, and ended up getting a gf who bullied me. To cut to the chase, they broke up and me and him became friends when he apologized for his behavior (I had moved back to the states at this point). \n\nNow, I found out that ex bff\u2019s behavior stemmed from the fact that he was upset at ending up moving back to India for university, due to being caught selling pot senior year of high school. Hence revocation of college acceptances here. This comes in later.\n\nCue me and ex bff being friends for the next 3 years. Summer 2015, he was going through a \u201cmeh\u201d phase, and I had a major car accident which was my fault. Around this time, he gets a new gf (23F), and suddenly his \u201cmeh\u201d phase is gone. But only when it comes to her. I\u2019m wary only because of ex-gf, but ex bff promises me that it won\u2019t happen this time.\n\nKeep in mind, they are in another country. So he introduces us via group chat. I try to be cordial and friendly. I even Skyped her a few times. So I decide she\u2019s alright. \n\nOnce, ex bff gave me his Skype password to pass on a message to her which I did. Fast forward to winter 2015. Ex bff ended up having to repeat the semester at his university due to not showing up because he was too depressed to deal with people except his gf. So he was holed up in his apartment smoking weed and playing dota. Keep in mind, this is the SECOND time that this happened to him.\n\nMe and him also had a heart to heart about both our struggles with depression, and he threw in, \u201cgf comes to me and says \u2018is OP really one of your  best friends? She doesn\u2019t get you like I do.\u201d It was this statement, which just bugged me initially.\n\nSo yeah, her little sentiment came from the fact that I, suffering from severe, untreated anxiety leading to massive overthinking, would kind of tell her that I was worried ex bff would react a certain way to something. And also was ruminating over guy problems I was having. I found out that she sent screenshots to him about me overthinking said guy problems followed with \u201cthat\u2019s probably why OP called you. She wants to talk about that. Is she actually depressed? Idk what to say to someone like that.\u201d \n\nYes, I went through his Skype. That wasn\u2019t my proudest moment, and I fully accept IATA for doing that. But I also did it to know where I stood. Winter break 2015, ex bff\u2019s sister was getting married in their state, and I knew I was going to be invited because he asked for my address to mail me my invitation. But turns out bride to be was having second thoughts, leading to a lot of drama. Also found out from snooping.\n\nSo yes, I was jealous that he was telling his gf those things, and not me. And he was redirecting his anger from family\u2019s frustration at the wedding situation being taken out on him on me. But showing his nice face to his girlfriend who was behaving condescendingly towards me. Blatantly saying things to him and that he wasn\u2019t sticking up for me. It doesn\u2019t justify why I did it and I admit I was wrong for snooping, but at least I knew she was behaving disrespectfully. And I wanted to know where I stood.\n\nAll eventually settles down on that front. I tell him I\u2019m upset he didn\u2019t tell me anything about the wedding situation and that I was angry about the things his gf said. He justifies both with \u201cit made me so angry I only really told her,\u201d and \u201cstop holding grudges.\u201d No, I didn\u2019t expect him to leave her just for a few disrespectful jabs. Just to acknowledge that it was uncalled for. But NOPE, it\u2019s \u201cmy future wife this, that, blablabla.\u201d\n\nFall 2017, ex bff tells me his friend, F, is attending grad school in my state. F is his former gf\u2019s ex bff herself. So F and I link up and I hear from her about how the gf was a shitty friend who fucked F off the second she was in a relationship. WE NOW HAVE ANOTHER TESTIMONY THAT THIS GIRL SUCKS. \n\nSo it turns out the gf\u2019s family didn\u2019t approve of ex bff. And they expected her to move to another country for work. Which she did, to pacify them. So ex bff was bummed. I initially tried to be supportive and said \u201cmaybe you can visit!\u201d Followed by a glum \u201cshe won\u2019t have time.\u201d I can guarantee you if the roles were reversed that he would launch into how my bf sucked for not making time, and how I have horrible taste in guys etc. \n\nAnyway, F and I were hanging out later that night and we Skype ex bff who was still glum. F immediately goes like \u201cfuck her.\u201d Impulsive, adrenaline charged me, who was pumped to have an ally who hates this girl blurted out \u201cyeah, we hate the Bitch!\u201d Followed by him getting all mad. F then tries to explain her stance, Followed by ex bff saying that she was playing the victim. I tried to pacify him and apologize, and he seemingly was ok until he was like \u201cI\u2019m still mad at you OP.\u201d DESPITE ME TRYING TO EXPLAIN THAT I WAS NOT TRYING TO RUB SALT IN HIS WOUNDS OR ISSUE AN ULTIMATUM.\n\nSo a week later, he messages me \u201cI\u2019ve given you enough time to apologize but you didn\u2019t so I don\u2019t want to be your friend. Enjoy the rest of your life.\u201d And deleted me from social media. And I ugly cried at work and got sent home early.\n\nTo summarize: this is someone who got busted selling drugs and got his college acceptances revoked, leading to him attending college in another country. His parents were chill af about it. Mine would have let me rot in prison and I\u2019d be dead to them.\n\nThen, spends time skipping class to play dota and smoke weed in his dorm room. To the point he loses attendance and repeats the semester. Not once, BUT TWICE. My parents, assuming they let the drug dealing slide, would fly out to beat my ass. HIS DID NOT. \n\nSo, taking all this and the fact that his gf pretty much ENABLED all of that just Bc she was made the center of his universe. I already know IATA for reading his Skype chats, but AITA overall in this situation?\n\nTLDR: AITA for holding years of resentment in from my former best friends gf treating me disrespectfully and saying I hate her just as the relationship is about to be an LDR\n\n", "output": "EVERYBODY", "category": "Ethics Classification 1125.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, identify who is wrong here.

He has a pretty steady group of friends that I pretty much all know, and I am offered to hang out with, but only do so sporadically because I feel like they\u2019re my husbands friends, he grew up with them, they\u2019re older and ultimately, I very much support him going to the bar with them or play games or whatever. If it\u2019s like a party or an event, I am happy to go and they are all great people.\nI started a new job where are I FINALLY after almost two years of not having proper friends and missing everyone back in Europe, made good connections and I hang out with group of people (about 3 to 8 people) pretty regularly after work (we all work at Disneyland, so it\u2019s easy to just pop in for a few hours after work without going home). \nThe thing is, as much as I love my husband I also enjoy being a stupid 20 year old and hang out with people my age or a little younger, which is all of them in this group. It makes me so happy that I finally have connections of my own and \u2018my\u2019 group, because as a new person in the US I had to rely on my husband for that and had to blend in in his group, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have anybody and I didn\u2019t have the luxury to have someone I grew up with or like a high school friends I would know for years, and this really bothered me. My husband always encouraged me to make friends, too. \nHere is the thing.  My husband now keeps asking why am I not introducing him to my friends (which he met at least 3 of them when he was with me after work, not in a group but I introduced them, but we never hang out) and wants to hang out with us, but its not what I want. He feels like I dont include him.\nI feel like in general I am very independent person and I was never clingy or have the need to spend all my free time with any SO in the past or include them in every little thing I do - I like to think that people dont merge all of a sudden to one entity and have to intertwine everything theyre doing and have like shared friend group.\nAlso, as much as our age difference isnt an issue in day to day life, I feel like I had to grow up a lot and didnt enjoy my early twenties at all, which  I get to enjoy now with my new friends - my husband being older would totally not fit into this group because of it. I dont want to think about if he is entertained and having a good time with bunch of stupid 20 year olds . \n\nTo add more info, i mostly hang out with them right after work, like once or twice a week, rarely stay out late, they are all good people, no drinking, all very safe and mostly at Disneyland. I would not prioritize my friends over my husband but I sure value my own happiness as well. The time spent with my friends doesnt shorten the time spent with my husband.

We were arguing about a piece of fudge of his that I ate, I said \u201cI\u2019m glad I ate it\u201d to purposely bug him because I was mad (not proud of it), then he hit me. He hit me on the back, pushed me into a corner, and yelled in my face. He yelled at me to \u201cfuck off\u201d, and keep in mind he\u2019s 6\u20198. Apparently the real reason for him doing this was that a few weeks before, they were camping and so my boyfriend stayed over for the weekend without them knowing. They say this really broke their trust. \n\nNothing like that has ever happened before, and it\u2019s really affected me. My doctor and therapist both say I\u2019ve been traumatized. My depression and eating disorder, which were in remission, came back solely because of this, I had nightmares, and loud noises would make me freak out and I couldn\u2019t calm down. At one point, I was scared to be in my own home. I moved things in front of the door to have a shower because I thought someone would come in and hit me. As well as this, things would happen like something would drop something near where my art teacher was standing, and my first thought was that my sweet art teacher was hitting someone. \n\nMy dad never really apologized, either. He said \u201cI\u2019m sorry for how this all worked out\u201d, which in my opinion isn\u2019t a really an apology. I also told him, through tears, that he wasn\u2019t realizing how big of a deal what he did is, and to that he said I don\u2019t realize how big of a deal what I did was. My mom wasn\u2019t very supportive through all of it, and my siblings said things like \u201cI see both sides\u201d, and \u201cwhat you said was disgusting\u201d. I asked my mom if we were just going to brush this under the rug, and she said no, but no one did anything. My dad thinks him promising to not do it again is good enough. My mom said if he had hit her she would definitely leave, but I guess for some reason it\u2019s okay to hit me? \n\nSo anyway, I spent thanksgiving with my boyfriend\u2019s family (I live in Canada so this was mid October), and I want to spend Christmas with his family as well. My doctor said I\u2019d be slighting my family, and if I want a relationship with them I shouldn\u2019t, but I really don\u2019t want to spend time with them like that. Also, I\u2019m 18 if that matters. So, WIBTA?\n\nTL;DR My dad hit me, according to my doctor and therapist this literally traumatized me. Because of this and the lack of support from my family, I want to do what I did for thanksgiving and spend Christmas with my boyfriend\u2019s family.

Well we were trying but you want to make sure.that care is strapped down or some bad shit will happen. Then his wife starts honking on the horn and doesn't let up and the husband says you can just pull forward and we can squeeze by. But since the car wasnt strapped down that wasnt possible and we explained that and he got mad. I guess he knew my grandfather because he threw his name out there saying this isn't the (insert my last name) I kbow. Which is funny because my grandfather would have told him to fuck off way quicker than I did. Which I told him while i told him to fuck off.

Hope had come over a few times, two times paying for pizza was her idea (I didn't even ask for pizza, she wanted to share with with my roommate and I), Hope called me up wanting to end her life and to meet at a restaurant for a meal (I dropped literally everything after a day of full classes to make sure she was ok) and was with her the whole time she was in the waiting room and ER (she paid for coffee and food there too), I asked her for deodorant because I had none (which I agreed to pay her back for), and we went out to one other meal so we could stay warm.\n\nShe also offered me a bag of skin/hair care products because she is allergic to them. She said if I don't take them she would throw them out.\n\nSo, Brenda messages me after we went out for coffee one day and said that she can't keep paying for me and that we all would have coffee again when I could afford my own. I was upset because I was actually getting out of the house and socializing, but I understood.

I got told no by both of them. Hope then says that she feels that I took advantage of her.\n\nI figured that I owed Hope $350 for everything she paid for and gave me, which she agreed to. Tonight I told her I would start paying her back when I could afford to.\n\nKeep in mind that 97% of the money I got this month from student loans and rental supplement went to rent. I got a whole $13 from disability. \n\nHope said that I owed her $450 before the products she gave me and she was being generous with that figure. When I asked her to explain how I owed that much money, she backed down and said that I only owed her $350. I actually wanted to total it up so I started to list everything. She included literally every interaction we ever had. I only got to about $300 before she started to guilt trip me. I caved and said that with all the products I would make it an even $1,000. I knew that she would start to demand I pay her for the products she gave me. Keep in mind that these are used products, almost all of them are half filled.\n\nHope started to demand that I pay her in one lump sum. I told her that I would start paying her back in 6 months, after I get out of the hole with my bills. I explained that if I don't pay my bills that I won't have a phone, internet, or a place to live.

I was told that they were busy being newly married, who just bought a house and didn't only want to see family for \"special occasions\" and that it would be easier for that bond to be there if we didn't just stop going to family dinners (referring to the issues with his parents). I reminded her that I had frequently invited her and YB to our house for dinner (for over 6 years I played host, even before my husband and i were married or had any issues with the family) and that they turned down the invitations more often than not. Told her I didn't want to fight, just that we were upset, but told her to take care.\n\n\nThe day of our daughters party, YB texted my husband all day about how he was \"just chilling in his basement\".

I'm in CT, she's in NYC. I travel 2hrs to get to the city and am staying at my friend's place the night before I'm supposed to go on this date. Have to travel another 30/40 mins to get to her area in the city.  I text her that night just checking in to make sure everything is still good and narrow down when and where. \n\nI suggest we meet up and get lunch somewhere. She says ok, and asks if I have a place in mind. I say nah, was hoping u did, kinda joking around that it's her turf, figured she would know some spots. I suggest I'd be down to get sushi and pay for her cuz she told me that's her favorite food.\n\nShe says never mind, forget about the date. I'm like wtf? She says since I didn't have a place in mind, I wasn't serious about meeting. She says it takes 2 mins to look up a place and I wasn't putting in effort.  I called her conceited and said I traveled my ass to her, was gonna buy her food, and that it was ridiculous reason to cancel. She hits me with I'm being too emotional, and that she is on her period and it's her job to be emotional. Says I have no chivalry, and if I wasnt so feminine maybe I'd get some p****. Also, says I shouldn't be treating her like this on IWD.\n\nI say yea I'm allowed to be emotional, didn't know I needed to bleeding outta my d*** to show it. Also say well since I have so much estrogen I'm practically a woman and she shouldn't be treating me like this on IWD.  I tell her im glad we aren't meeting cuz im not on a quest to stick my d*** in as many holes as possible, have too much chivalry for that. (Honestly if she was dtf I'd have been down, but expectations for the date was just lunch and roam around NYC. But that response sounded clever to me.)\n\nI delete her number and our conversation, then hit her up on SC asking for screenshots cuz I thought of posting it in here. Understandably she said no cuz she didn't trust me. Calls me a stalker and psychopath.\n\nThis was supposed to be our first date, ha! Have had great conversation via text and was looking forward to finally meeting her.\n\nI have a tendency to overreact, being drunk definitely didn't help (Not an excuse, just a fact).

Obviously there is probably a slant to my text in my favor, no one's the bad guy in their own story right? I can honestly say I didn't curse at her or anything like, wether or not y'all believe me is another story.

At first he was sweet but as the course went on he had less time to hang out, he didn't answer anymore, he was stressed out and he started to stand me up on dates and stuff.. I reacted pretty badly at first as I was also starting a new job and I had to travel 3 hours every day and bike 20 kilometers to make it. I guess neither one of us were really in the right mood. Nonetheless, I got mad, started to get insecure and had a breakdown on him. So my best friend just told him to back off and he did. I was quite ashamed of myself so I apologized and he ignored me. When I saw that he was still watching my stories I just wrote to him something in the lines of: if you're going to ignore me do it right. Don't watch my stories. To that, he promptly deleted me from social medias and that was the end of it. \nAt that point I was pretty much the asshole I think.. anyways I leave that to your judgement. \n\nCouple of months later, he does his grand comeback and adds me on fb. I message him saying that I am not really comfortable with us being friends and all.. And I do it very nicely I think.. He gets mad tells me off and blocks me on fb. I tell it to my best friend and he then confide that my ex is feeling lonely and that he hasn't really connected with any flight attendants and his job doesn't really allow him to with anyone. I find his number and text him telling him that I didn't mean him to take it that way it's just I still remember the nice time we had together and it still hurts to talk to him. We then formally apologize to each other (especially me). But nothing more comes out of it. We don't talk again as I made it clear that it was over and that I don't befriend my exes. \n\nFast forward to last Sunday.. my best friend posts a story of us at a party and my ex suddenly remembers that he didn't wish me a HNY... 13 days later.. I just answer thanks, you too even though it's a little late. He starts joking around with wink faces and I just tell him what's new to be polite... Two days later and he didn't answer.. I texted him well never mind, hope your having a good one, bye now... Through that part, you have to keep in mind that I'm really depressed because my contract ended so I don't have a job, both my best friends are an ocean away and well I'm bored, I don't have social contact or anything.. the smallest thing throws me off.. So small talks with someone I don't specially want to talk too are not really something I enjoy. \nHe gets mad at me, and says still moody I see, I've been working you should know. And I tell him that I'm not mentally well so to cut me some slack. So to that he kinda tries to apologize and the typical if you want to talk I'm here. And if there's one thing I really don't need right now is pity. \n\nSo I try to explain to him gently that even though I appreciate his support, it's really not what I need right now and I'd rather not talk to him.. and he gets mad saying that I'm just trying to push him away, that I shouldn't treat him like that he's doing everything out of his own free will.. And I try to explain to him that I need someone to hang out with here in my city not half a world away, I don't to feel vulnerable to him by talking with him as a crutch as it would hurt me more than anything.. he gets mad again, and so explain once more putting an accent on the fact that I don't hate him or anything. He doesn't answer again for 2 days.. So I just tell him not to contact me again as the wait is more painful than anything. And he starts saying that I'm spitting in the face of maybe the only person that cares for me, and if that's how I treat people who care, I'm going to need luck. That everything he did he did it out of free will and that I twisted it all around. \n\nThere I got mad, and I told him that I tried to explain to him many times, and that I do have people who care and not to presume on how I treat them. As for him caring, it's all lie he's telling himself to make himself feel better that he better not blame me, if he still hasn't got it through his head that by texting me he's not doing me any good. Theeeen I blocked him.. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\nThanks everyone who kept on going until here!

We hang out a lot after work and on the weekends, etc. A few of us are new this year, I\u2019ve been working here for less than a year. The way our workplace runs, our manager changes every April. Our new manager is very nice and we get along great. Last year\u2019s manager was the same way. However, apparently in the past there have been run-ins with managers and two of my coworkers, let\u2019s call them Tom and Steve. Tom and Steve have been at the company for 3 and 4 years, respectively. They also happened to be taking PTO for a week while the transition occurred, and we decided to pull an April Fools prank on them while they were out.\n\nWe have a group chat that we use all the time, and on April 1st none of us were particularly busy, so we decided to pull a prank on Tom and Steve. One of my coworkers sent a message in the group chat saying that we had a meeting with our new manager and it went horribly. We all jumped in and backed him up, and said that the new manager was pissed that Tom and Steve weren\u2019t present for his first day and this new meeting. Tom replied to our messages explaining that he had requested this time off months ago and there was nothing he could do about it. He seemed pretty upset but not that worried about it. The conversation kinda stopped there for about an hour since Steve hadn\u2019t read the messages yet. TBH, based on the reaction we were getting from Tom, I thought this was kinda a lame prank. Tom didn\u2019t seem worried and didn\u2019t really react. Then Steve jumped in finally, and it heated up. He used some rather spicy words to describe his feelings towards this, and after about 5 minutes of going back and forth, we got the reaction we wanted, so we told them it was an April Fools joke. Those of us in the office that day thought it turned out pretty well. Turns out, though, that Tom and Steve were pretty pissed. They messaged back saying that they were upset with us for bothering them with this while they\u2019re trying to relax on their time off.\n\nI guess I understand where they\u2019re coming from, but is this really that big an issue? It\u2019s not like our prank was something that required them to drop everything they were doing and put out a fire, we just told them the new boss was mad at them, and after a few messages we told them it was in fact a prank. I know that they\u2019ve had bad encounters with previous managers that weren\u2019t very nice, but I mean, it\u2019s April Fools and I thought this was a pretty harmless prank. On top of that, the new boss is awesome, so we\u2019re in for a good year under his leadership. Tom and Steve haven\u2019t messaged the GC since Monday, which is unusual for them. They\u2019re back at work now and one of my coworkers saw them this morning and said hi but they gave him the silent treatment.

My team is 5 people in two locations with only myself and a coworker at my location in a control room with ~50 others. I have been working for a long time and am very respected for my knowledge regarding our work. My coworker was trained by me and is still being mentored when we have overlap on our shifts. \n\nMy coworker is on the same pay as me as we are covered by an enterprise agreement and there is no 'senior' position for me to move into currently. We work shifts that alternate weekly, either 4.30am-12.30pm or 12pm-8pm. My coworker has been here for about 5 months. My coworker has been viewed by management on multiple occasions to bludge through a shift on his phone. \n\nBasically our morning shift is meant to give a handover in the 30 minute overlap to the afternoon shift in order to complete work the early shift started but did not finish and to pass on important information (we support applications used in the control room so outages/issues need to be known/monitored). The handover is also meant for the afternoon shift to provide information to the morning sjfit but NOT work tasks (due to morning shift having important set work).\n\nI came into work (early shift this week) and checked our handover document and there were 4 tasks on it for me which would take about an hour. I also checked the group mailbox and the three emails I had handed over the previous afternoon were all assigned back to me. We also have a new starter who is friends with my coworker who advised that he was watching live streams for most of his shift and chatting via messenger. Admittedly in one task the coworker was asking for assistance to learn a new task so I'm happy with that but the remaining three tasks were work he could've easily done as our afternoon shift does not have an assigned workload. \n\nI messaged my coworker to let him know that the handover is only meant to be informative for the morning shift as per our process set by our manager. I mentioned that our manager has been unhappy with any deviation from process lately and was simply giving an FYI to save his skin in the future (evening shift is fairly relaxed as you need to find work if none is handed over so management tries to monitor work completed during this time).\n\nMy coworker responded with a meme of a little girl rolling her eyes with the caption \"When your coworker tries to act like your supervisor. Please Susan, act your wage\". Now this panged me pretty hard as I have been the one to train and mentor this coworker and have made a huge effort to up-skill him to handle the role which in turn can justify a pay rise for us both (change of grade/reclassify position) which he seems to want a lot.\n\nSo, AITA for feeling disrespected? I simply wrote the information in the handover document and kept my headphones on for our 30 minute overlap yesterday then left without saying a word.

Near the beginning of our relationship, he had some financial struggles. I wasn\u2019t hurting for money (and he knew that but never asked) so I let him know that he can ask to borrow money from me if needed. He declined at first but ultimately ended up borrowing some money from me (a couple thousand). I understand and accept that I shouldn\u2019t have lent such a large amount of money, but I loved him and knew it wasn\u2019t in his character to just take the money and run. We had agreed to have him pay me back within a couple months (monthly payments). He was working part-time but wasn\u2019t making much more than minimum wage.\n\nWeeks later, he told me that he wouldn\u2019t be able to pay me back per our payment plan and asked if we could push it back. I told him to take his time and that I didn\u2019t expect him to pay it back any time soon. I wanted him to focus on school and work\u2014I didn\u2019t want him to stress about owing me money. I saw our relationship continuing far into the future so it didn\u2019t bother me. We never rly spoke about the borrowed money again throughout the rest of our relationship. He maybe brought it up a total of 3 or 4 times saying that he felt bad he couldn\u2019t pay me back right away.\n\nA year later, he took a break from school and began working full time. I know he had made enough to pay me back but I knew he wasn\u2019t planning on working when he went back to school so the money he was making during his gap year was to sustain him for the duration of his schooling once he returned. A year later, he went back to school and our relationship was rocky. It had now been about two years since I\u2019ve lent him the money. I broke up with him because he wasn\u2019t putting effort into our relationship. We ended on good terms but kinda awkward. We talked a lot at the beginning of our breakup but now we don't talk and he never brought up the money. About two months after we broke up, I asked him if he could pay me back. At the time I asked him, we were still talking every now and then. When I brought it up, he apologized, said he forgot and asked if I wanted the money in full now. Knowing his situation, I said that I didn't expect him to pay it all back now. He said he could maybe start paying me back in the summer but to let him know if I need some of it or all of it now. I told him I understood his current financial situation and didn't expect to take money away from him right now when he doesn't have an income. He said thanks for understanding, and we haven't really talked since then.\n\nIt's been a while since we last talked and it doesn't seem he's making an effort to maintain our friendship. The last message I sent him (unrelated to this) was left on read and it doesn't look like we'll be talking or hanging out any time soon.

I have only been here for 2 months and she is a new(ish) manager. We are also understaffed. The official rules say we need to have a 2 week notice but this came short notice so I only gave a 5 day. Here are the exact texts as they went down today. \n\n\"Hey (manager). I wont be able to make it to my shift this Saturday. Sorry in advance for the short notice.\"\n\n\"How come? Also did you find coverage?\"\n\n\"Its personal reasons and your the first person i told. I can ask around but if I cannot find coverage I still would not be able to come. And if I could pick up the hours on another day I am down.\"\n\n\"Ok this is a one time pass. I will not allow this ever again. It\u2019s a rule that you need to find coverage or you are written up. I\u2019m letting this go this time and don\u2019t worry about finding coverage I will adjust the schedule on Monday\"\n\n\"Thank you. Again sorry for the short notice. Do you need me to ask around?\"\n\n\"Also just a heads up never message your manager saying FYI I\u2019m not coming in on a certain day if I find coverage or not. It\u2019s not polite nor professional. Asking for help is the way to go bud. It goes a long way. No I will change it accordingly on Monday\"\n\n\"It was an emergency and I asked my mom.

I was hoping they would play together even though I feel like she is not interested in her unless there are people around.

She was saying that her new appliance is not working well and that she'll bring it back to get refunded. I say she could also exchange it and she starts to shout she wants her money back. Ok.

We had an argument earlier because I asked if they could tell me beforehand when someone is coming or when they decide to take an appointment for me...not a few minutes before it's happening.

Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?", "output": "OTHER", "category": "Ethics Classification 1125.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, identify who is wrong here.

Also on mobile so maybe a few spelling mistakes but you should get the gist, it's also on the long side.  So I'm 17 I go to an alternative school that's very independent based and you can basically do 3 hours a week if you want (you got to go 3 days a week and if you come early, you can get out within the hour ). There are 4 teachers there plus a curriculum leader. Anyway, this semester there's a bit of a group starting (yay I have friends now) but there's also this kid who's kinda weird and while I'll talk to him, he kind of doesn't understand social cues,  keeps talking about his Internet girlfriend and talks about his mom as this monster (which I don't believe because apperwntly she works for children's aid, I'm pretty sure they are checked out plus he's told some really convaluted stories that don't really make sense, he also regularly talks about stiff you shouldn't talk about  and makes everyone super uncomfortable on a semi regular basis (at least once a week). Anyway, today he calls his mom in the middle of school (ehile the osslt test is going on and it's a small school, there are also no phone calls allowed because it is disruptive to everyone) . He starts swearing and yelling at his mom, while there are about 7 of us in the conference room ND we all know him relatively well and we are kind of in shock. One of the girls decides to film it (I'm not impressed with her on this part but she does not have a filter, she understands social cues bit she doesn't really care). It's about 10 minutes worth of him screaming at his mom, swearing at her and threatening to hurt her and after a few minutes, after the girl loses it laughing everyone including me stiffles back laughter and eventually loses it(I feel pretty bad but there is a time and a place and it was r/public freak out material). After a bit, this girl comes in and explains that she would never talk to her mom like this, he's being terrible to her, he just screams at her and she keeps on talking and telling him he's being an asshole and disrupting everyone. He throws a box of tissues at her head, throws his phone at the window and the curriculum teacher finally comes. I feel bad for being a bystander but there's also a time and a place to do this and he was saying some really awful yet ridiculous stuff (at one point he said he was doing this because he needed witnesses that she was being abusve, we couldn't really hear her because he was so loud but he said that she put us in shock when we were laughing) I'm suprised it took the curriculum teacher as long as it did but she was busy with getting a student registered but she eventually came and sorta calmed him down. After a video was made with he footage which was admittedly funny and involved syncing his screams to jurassic park, as well as capturing some of the reactions of people(I had no part in it but it was funny).

I was dealing with a lot of anxiety problems back then, and couldn\u2019t talk. Speaking to people almost hurt. If I was spoken to, I only responded in short 1-3 word replies. Being around people gave me a lot of anxiety. \n\nI made a friend with a guy in my political science class. Let\u2019s call him Dave. Our usual seats were next to each other. He was very friendly, but noticed I didn\u2019t talk very much. Even so, he persisted in trying to make friends. He encouraged me to communicate via notes. We became good friends, and I learned to be a little more comfortable around Dave and people in general. I\u2019d often walk to his apartment to study together and play games. Occasionally I\u2019d spend the night at his apartment if it got too late. I thought our relationship was purely a friendship. Dave asked me if I wanted to date around the time I turned 18 and I declined. We were still good friends. He eventually started dating this sweet Filipina girl.\n\nDave would gush about her often, and show me his girlfriend\u2019s awesome drawings. I was really happy for them! I was eager to meet his girlfriend, and asked to meet her because she sounded really cool. I probably only saw her once or twice though. Around 2016 they got engaged. I was very happy for them and wished them happiness!\n\nOne day during Winter I went over to Dave\u2019s apartment to hang out and play Super Smash Bros. I had so much fun I didn\u2019t notice the time fly by. Nighttime came and Dave offered me to spend the night because it was dark and very cold outside. I accepted. \n\nDave\u2019s fianc\u00e9e was out of town at the time. He asked me if I wanted to have sex with him. I said no. \n\nI was really innocent at that age, and I truly believed that if we had a heartfelt talk I would be able to help him sort out his priorities and help him realize why that\u2019s a bad idea. I wanted to be a good friend. I asked Dave if he really loved this girl, and if he was willing to spend the rest of his life with her. He said yes. I asked him why would he try to cheat if he really felt that way. He said something like, \u201cI want to live a little before I settle down.\u201d I told him that if he wanted to \u201clive a little\u201d before settling down, then he shouldn\u2019t have gotten engaged. I told him that he should really reflect on our conversation, and really think about what\u2019s important to him. I went to sleep. \n\nAfter that, we kinda drifted apart. I moved away to a different state.\n\nI never told his fianc\u00e9e what happened. \nI recently saw a Facebook post that they got married early last year. Looking back on it, I feel kinda bad. Maybe I should have told her back then. If he asked someone else, he might\u2019ve actually cheated on the poor girl. Maybe he even asked someone else after I said no. \n\nOr maybe he actually took my words to heart.

He was going to work on a project, but I had just gotten off work and was tired, but I didn't mind going. In fact I usually enjoy going here, but this time I was mostly just going to wait for him to finish. We got there around 9PM. At 10:40 I went to find him, feeling very tired now with an upset stomach. I asked how his progress was going, and if we could leave soon. He said if we left then he'd have trouble finding his place again, and we agreed to leave at 11:30. Well this time has come and gone, and I go to find him at 12:15. He is still working and lost track of time. I'm annoyed but don't make a fuss. He starts getting his things together. By the time we actually leave it's 12:40. He notices I'm not my usual chipper self, I haven't smiled, etc and asks what's bothering me. At first I try to play it off and not say anything, but he asks again so I tell him I'm a little annoyed we're leaving so late. He responds dismissively, asking why I'm making a big deal out of it, and this pisses me off - I snap at him and tell him not to bother asking if he doesn't want to know what's bothering me. He asks why I'm acting like this, it's not like he did it on purpose, and how I don't \"normally\" get so upset when he's late. I said I know he didn't do it on purpose, or I would be a lot more upset, but it did hurt that he would be so inconsiderate as to not check the time at all, especially since I had already told him I wasn't feeling well and wanted to go home much earlier. He says he's sorry we're leaving so late but he didn't do anything wrong b/c it was an accident, I can't be mad at him for losing track of time. I tell him it was thoughtless and inconsiderate, he says I'm implying it was intentional. I tell him he's blowing it up and he's the only saying anything about it being intentional - I was upset based on it being an accident. I'm getting more upset b/c of 1. He was thoughtless, but that was a small amount of upset 2. Instead of apologizing he insisted he had nothing to be sorry about. We argues the whole way home, to the point where I said I was tired of debating, neither of us were changing our minds and I was tired of him trying to convince me that I was wrong to be annoyed. \n\nAnother bit of information - my birthday is this Sunday, and we're going out to dinner with my folks. We've been together for 6 years, but he's not doing anything for my bday, no present, no date, no anything, the only reason I'm getting any kind of special treatment is because of my folks. I'm trying not to show my disappointment, trying not to feel selfish, but I think I lashed out at him b/c of these feelings. However, I still think he was inconsiderate tonight.

That being said, they had been broken up for two months by this point probably should have calmed down a bit by now.\n\nAnyways, on with the story:\nMy friends and I are all university students and we had planned to get baked at their flat and watch tv and listen to music etc. \n\nWe ended up getting super high and pretty vegetative for most of the evening, so when their flatmate came through and wanted to talk uninvited, we weren\u2019t overly excited by the prospect. That sounds bad, but it has to be noted that she\u2019s really, really annoying. She only ever wants to talk about herself and vent about her day, quickly changing the subject back to herself if someone mentions something else.\n\nShe can also be rude as shit and be completely unapologetic about it. Previously she had mentioned that only one of our group looks like he actually goes to the gym, and whilst she\u2019s not entirely wrong, it\u2019s still a mean thing to say, and she didn\u2019t even think she\u2019d been rude when confronted about it. \n\nSo none of us were really interested in talking, so we suggested watching The Big Lez Show (Which she hates) to get her to leave. She responds by sitting at the computer and playing her own music. We\u2019re all quite open to new music, but this was really not good and she refused to change it, so now we\u2019re stuck with no Big Lez and some pretty shit tunes. \n\nAt this point, we\u2019re too high to deal with this, so we all kind of just started moaning at her to change the song and let us watch something. She keeps laughing as we keep asking her to change the music and let us watch Big Lez, and even keeps laughing and trying to talk as we straight up tell her to fuck off. It wasn\u2019t until we brought out a nerf gun and threatened to shoot her with a dart that she finally left. Whilst one of held the nerf gun and lazily pointed it in her general direction, the rest of us all screamed \u201cSHOOT HER\u201d repeatedly until she left in a strop. We weren\u2019t entirely serious and were quite surprised that it actually worked.

After they lost, I sent out a text to our group chat in mock seriousness saying that I was dropping out and not putting in my $5. Well my friend took this very serious and started complaining to me, but I ignored him for the time doing my classwork instead. After the class ended we went to lunch and were all hanging out watching a new game of the tournament. That's when I felt something touching my backpack(which I still had on). When I turned around I saw my friend in the pocket where I keep my lunch money.(Take into account I only get $20 a month for when I forget my lunch). I was angry, stealing is one of the few things that I do not tolerate, and I tolerate a lot. I was angry so I stood up from my chair and reached for him. I accidentally grabbed one of his earbuds and due to my anger I pulled. Well, the earbud ripped out and was now on the ground. He seemed shocked and dropped my money which I hurried to grab. After that he demanded that I pay for his earbuds. I refused at first because I was still angry and we went our separate ways. I later payed the $5 for the bet, and our friend group was staying neutral. A few hours later on the drive home from school I sent a text apologizing for breaking the earbuds and that it was an accident. Within seconds he said \"F you. I'm blocking you.\" After that I told my friends that I would not pay for new earbuds unless he apologized, and made my friends promise not to tell him this .That is the story so far, my friends are trying to get him to cool off, but I don't know how it is going.

Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi.

We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie.

I agreed, as at the time we were pretty close, considering each other best friends. Along with the 2DS I gave him some Pok\u00e9mon games that he\u2019d always expressed interest in. This included: Pearl, White, Y, Alpha Sapphire, and Moon. Each of these games roughly cost $40 for me to buy.

Neighborhood traffic can go around the school street by taking the street directly behind us.\n\nYTA: We chose to live on a school street. Although it was once *my* elementary school, we\u2019re living in prime space for schoolchildren and ethically we should yield to their traffic. I can get off my lazy ass most of the time and move my car out of the driveway; the needs of the many (neighborhood traffic) outweigh the needs of the few (me) and I shouldn\u2019t use the legality as a crutch. The fact that it happens more often than not means I should find a proper solution; otherwise I could maybe get away with it \u201cjust this once\u201d.\n\nNAH: I\u2019m in the right but traffic has the right to be upset at me (and leave upset notes on my car).\n\nESH: I could be doing my part but ultimately the street is ill-equipped for school traffic.\n\nAITA?

I was okay with it but cautious. It didn't end up working out because she threw a tantrum in front of my toddler, blatantly disrespected me and my position as a wife, and admitted to leaving shaving razors out so my son \"would learn\" that they're sharp (I previously asked her to place them higher in the shower, out of reach). I had enough of her being a rude guest and had her leave.\n\nFast forward a few days and I realize a \"gift\" she got me, one piece out of three in a facial cleansing thing, was missing. I asked my spouse to ask her about it next time he saw her. She told him that \"[i] didn't like it nor use it so [she] took it.\" I later explained to my husband that her response was a lie, since she had seen me use it, complimented the results, and asked if I liked it which I always said yes. At this point I was annoyed she lied, adding onto the already rude behavior.\n\nFast forward to last week, she visited my husband for lunch. I asked him (she has me blocked everywhere) to tell her that I'm willing to let the past be past if she apologizes for the theft (I'm even okay with her just saying it was a misunderstanding at this point). He talks to her but she dismisses my attempt to fix our relationship by saying she \"does not have the emotional capacity to deal with [me] right now.\" Okay I guess.\n\nFast forward to today. Since she doesn't want to admit to theft, the new rule is she can visit but not come into the house without me being there to make sure she doesnt get happy hands, per say. She stopped by while I was at work. I wasnt too happy about this so I went there on my break to make sure she understood the boundary. I parked at the entrance of our complex and made my way to our building when I saw her car approaching me. I didn't let her pass, so she rolled down her window.\n\nI explained that she is not welcome here because of the theft, and unless she apologizes, she will not be allowed to enter my home. She changed her reason for the theft from the response earlier to \"it was mine so I took it.\" I told her that's not how gifts work, and even explained that her original response was also not true. She told me, \"I would buy a thousand of those [gift item] if it would shut you up.\" At this point I'm frustrated. I knew she was going on a road trip, so I said \"I hope you crash on the way there.\" As I walked away she called me an evil bitch.\n\nI know I could've passed on saying that, and I also know I could've been a lot more harsh. I'm so fed up with a woman twice my age treating me like garbage, despite me being the wife of her only son. \n\nAm I the asshole?

Just about everything that happens on the island stays in the island, and everything that happens outside of the island stays outside of the island. That being said, I have a very close friend from off the island. Let\u2019s call her M (17F)\n\n* I am 17 years old, male\n\n* D is 18M, a friend from my school. Very quirky, but we love him nonetheless\n\n* R is 17F, my cousin (on this insular community she may as well be my sister)\n\n* N is 19F, my sister, good friends with D\n\n* A is 16F, another girl from our school\n\n* J is 18M, another friend of mine. \n\n* M knows me extremely well, she\u2019s my best friend and we know each other extremely well. M knows R and N, but not to the point that I do\n\n* M is the only one from off the island\n\n* M does not know D, J, or A\n\n* Many if these people are not my closest friends, but friends nonetheless. Not the people I would sit with at an event\n\n* D often creates group chats that include R, J, N, A, himself, me, and many others. \n\n* I was planning on asking another girl, C(18F) (she\u2019s not relevant to the story) to our schools prom, but my mother had told M that I was going to ask her, which I had no idea. M texted me saying that she\u2019d love to go with me because she hates her city, and loves mine. I say that will be taking her, because I\u2019d rather explain to C the situation and take my friend to prom than tell me friend \u201cNo I don\u2019t wanna go to prom with you\u201d\n\n* I asked D and A for advice the day the previous bulletpoint happened, after it occurred, asking where I should go from there. They came up with the same advice I had given myself.\n\n* These group chats are absolute chaos. It goes from extremely personal about depression and suicidal behavior to A and J just spamming \u201cepic gamer time\u201d, \u201cmy peepee hurts\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m gonna go poopoo\u201d. About 45 texts are sent per minute (that\u2019s an exaggeration, but it has gotten to that point)\n\nAlright: here comes the juicy stuff\n\nLast night, in the most recent group chat, D says that he\u2019s gonna make a new one, because this one was getting stale, and suggests he should add M because he thinks they should all get to know her before the prom. I say that they should meet her, but not in a group chat, again because it\u2019s very chaotic. D agrees\n\nEarlier today, I get a notification on my phone. A new group chat (*hooray*). I check to see who\u2019s in this one, because who wouldn\u2019t, and who do I see but M. Of course I\u2019m upset because this is exactly the opposite of what I wanted to happen. I text D, and he said that he did it because he thought they should get to know her before prom (me and M probably aren\u2019t even going to be sitting with them at prom). I tell him that he went against my word, and he said that it would stink if she felt awkward at prom, but she also has the ability to leave the group chat if she wants. He also said that he talked to R and N about M, and that they agreed she should be added. We settle on \u201cwe\u2019ll see what happens\u201d. \n\nLater on, J and A are in Houseparty (a Group FaceTime app) and I decide to pop in, as we do. Later I ask them if they know why D added M into the group chat, and A said that she and D did it when creating the group chat. I asked why, and she said why not. I explained that \u201cwhy not\u201d is because I explicitly asked the first group chat not to add M to the new one, and yet they did it anyways. All A could come up with was \u201cit\u2019s in the past\u201d. I was soon whisked away by my family to eat dinner.\n\nLater, D texts me asking is we could talk. I say sure, because that\u2019s what friends are for. He then FaceTimes me for 44 minutes and about how it\u2019s in the past, and how I\u2019ve done things that hurt him in the recent past (we were all talking about our 8th grade class trip to Washington DC, and how we look back and cringe, I brought up how as soon as we walked into our hotel room D stripped down to his underwear in front of me and J, making me quite uncomfortable. Me bringing this up in the group chat was what hurt him. D also has a *long* history of being easily offended by things, we had a falling out for a year over me not wanting to be part of a YouTube group he created)\n\nD explains that he can\u2019t fix what\u2019s in the past, I\u2019ve been mean to him before and that I\u2019m not taking M\u2019s feelings into consideration. I explained that he should have looked at things from M\u2019s point of view (being dumped into a chaotic group chat with a bunch of strangers, and three people she knows), and that not everyone can just be brought into something like this and be comfortable with everything. I also don\u2019t really want to be thought as one of the people who spam group chats with \u201cpeepee poopoo\u201d. I didn\u2019t tell this last point to him, but he still went on about how I\u2019ve hurt him, and I can\u2019t see everything the way she can, but I know her closer than I know my sister, and D has never met M. \n\nD also pointed out that A told him that she asked me if I was embarrassed by them before I hung up. I did not hear this, and while I enjoy their company, I can be embarrassed by them, but I never let them know because that\u2019s a dickish thing to do. I tell him I didn\u2019t hear her asking that.\n\nD concludes the 44 minute call with \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t be getting this upset about something as silly as a group chat\u201d. I conclude that it wasn\u2019t about that, more so that my friend went against my wishes.\n\nLater on, after the phone call I talk with N, my sister. I explain the situation, she says that D did not ask her when he claimed he did. She agrees with me until I bring up the thing about our Washington DC trip, because I had also pointed out in the group chat that D has large nipple, and he said he was really hurt by that. N pulled a complete 180 and kicked my out of her room where we were talking. \n\nSo now here I am writing this reddit post.

She makes reckless decisions without regard for consequences. L has never really done anything for herself, she is now 30 years old but has never pursued a particular career or paid her own rent, she has been supported by my bf\u2019s family. Recently she fell pregnant to man she had only briefly dated and decided to have the baby. After this the relationship broke down and she moved back in with my bf\u2019s family (he lives at home so I often spend time there).\n\nShe was consistently rude and bratty to bf and his family. She would leave food scraps and rubbish everywhere and would send rude messages to anyone if they annoyed her slightly. L also adopted a dog a few years ago which she failed to walk or take proper care of and that responsibility now also falls on my bf\u2019s parents. \n\nI will occasionally make comments to my boyfriend as it makes me angry seeing L treat everyone this way. An example: in order to help L her parents recently bought an apartment for her to live in rent-free. L constantly comments on how \u2018dark and depressing\u2019 the place is (It\u2019s honestly very nice). I told my boyfriend that I found this ungrateful and immature. \n\nI\u2019d never criticise L to her face as I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s my place. However, recently my bf and I had a fight about an unrelated issue and he got really upset. Afterwards, he told L that I\u2019ve been critical of her. L took this really badly. She blocked me on social media and did nothing but vent anger to her family. A week or so later my bf and I patched things up and I wanted to try and make amends to L. He told me that L had been messaging him about the situation, and at this point I was confused about why she was so upset so I asked if I could see some of the messages she\u2019d sent to try and understand where she was coming from. The messages were really aggressive and including things like \u2018OP is a nasty bitch\u2019, \u2018OP needs regular therapy\u2019 and \u2018OP is emotionally abusive\u2019. \n\nAfter reading this I was really angry, I typed out an apology to Lauren but it was badly worded and this escalated the situation even further. She called my boyfriend\u2019s parents screaming that she was a victim and that I was being hurtful. After giving the situation some time, I wrote another more careful apology which she finally responded to. At this point she is still unaware that I have seen her hurtful messages. \n\nMy bf wants to try and forget this situation but I\u2019m feeling hurt and think I deserve an apology. However, this would involve telling her that I\u2019d read the messages, which would no doubt stir up more drama. Part of the issue is that Lauren had a rough childhood with issues like bulimia, and is having a hard time being a single mother. AITA for insisting that she should apologise? I realise that she has had a hard time but I still believe L should be accountable for her actions.

Allot of the girls that I had been interested in in high school before had either told me that I wasn't their type, or that we should stay friends, or that I wasn't even in their league.

HOWEVER, after I posted on my Snapchat/Instagram stories as did her about our relationship. Many of the girls in my class who had rejected me in someway have now snapped me things like do you want to hang out? or come to a party with me? or just other requests I had never been given when I was single. One of the girls that had flat out said that she didn't like me personally texted me if I wanted to sit next to her at lunches and called me Hun.

For clarity, we\u2019ll refer to everyone as Andy (me), April (my SO), Leslie and Tammy. We all planned a trip to see a band we all like, which would have been about a 7 hour road trip. Leslie bought the tickets, and did not make us pay service fees (we\u2019ve all done this before, we never make each other pay service charges). \n\nBefore the trip, Tammy started having anxieties about the whole thing. She started fights, would ignore us for days/weeks, and was weirdly passive-aggressive about where we stayed, when we would get on the road, or what we planned to do while there. The show was in Boston, and we planned to leave Friday and get home late Sunday. We only had the weekend to do stuff, so we tried to fit in things we all wanted to do, but Tammy had a long (at least week\u2019s worth) list of things she wanted to do, on top of the concert. \n\nJust before we were supposed to leave, Tammy bought us tickets to the date of the tour in our hometown that the band had just added. She told us we all owed her the ticket charge + \\~$25 for service charges. We told her we would pay her back after the trip when we could, which we thought was fine considering Tammy had not paid Leslie back until the day before the concert. \n\nTammy refused to drive, blamed her pre-trip frustrations and anger on boy troubles, and then when we got there was MISERABLE the whole time. We went out of our way to do things she wanted (even walking the Freedom Trail in the New England downpour) and tried our best to make the trip worth it. When I asked if anyone had money to tip the maid, she yelled at me that she didn\u2019t have any money after spending $400 on tickets for us for the second date. She also complained about where we decided to stay (an AirBnB) then when it fell through and we needed to get a hotel, said she \u201ctold us\u201d that we should have gotten a hotel in the first place (she never met up with us for booking). \n\nThe final straw came in Salem. We (minus Tammy) wanted to go since it was the weekend before Halloween. She complained that we \u201conly cared about Halloween\u201d and she \u201cwanted to see Historical things\u201d - this was outside the Salem Town Hall. Despite this, she dropped $200 on souvenirs, and we drove home in near-silence. \n\nAfter it all, she refused to pay Leslie (who had eaten the extra cost for the hotel) for the parking, and told her she didn\u2019t want her in her life anymore. She then told her she \u201cknew\u201d April and I would never pay her back. We all tried to reason with her (she\u2019s often a lot of drama, but we always try to be supportive and steer her to better paths) and she blocked us all on social media and subtweeted about cutting \u201ctoxic people\u201d out of her life. We told her to sell our tickets, and she told us we were basically fucking her over. \n\nTL;DR: A friend was miserable and mean to us on a trip with her, we told her we no longer wanted to go to a concert with her, she called us toxic.

I didn't realize I was going to hit \"Fuck it. Done. Get out of my life.\" until the very moment it happened, and so had not properly prepared. Namely, I had left my cats at his house. Psycho has a lengthy arrest record and a tendency toward aggression and a complete lack of regard for other individuals. In the days following the breakup, our communications went something like: \"I want my cats back.\" \"Fuck you, They want to stay here.\" \"I'm coming to get them.\" \"They won't be here.\" until finally, verbatim, the message I sent was, \"Look. This is how this is going to work. I'm coming to get the cats. I'll call when I'm on my way so that you can have them ready. I'll bring the cops with me if I have to.\"  When I was on my way, I called, and he started ranting a bunch of bullshit,\"Fuck you, you're not stepping one foot in my house. Don't even pull in the drive. I'm not giving you shit. You're not taking shit from here.\" So I hung up and called police - non-emergency - to have a cop on-hand in an attempt to reduce the likelihood of an altercation. Yesterday I found out he called my mother after the cops and I had left and lied through his teeth about me. I got pissy, and reiterated my desire to **not** see him in person. He responded by getting super upset because I brought the cops to his house when he had drugs and a gun there. (He's explicitly not allowed to be in possession of a firearm, as he has two gun-related felonies under his belt.)  Apparently the existence of police in that situation warranted a response. He failed to factor in that my mother can't stand him, thinks he's a scumbag, and doesn't believe a word he says any other day of the week. (He's firmly convinced she adores him, which I think is mostly a testament to his delusional state of mind.)\n\nThere's a whole bunch of shit I'm leaving out - the manipulation, the scare-tactics, the invasions of privacy and space and boundaries, not to mention the circumstances surrounding the aforementioned threats on the lives and safety of myself and those I care most for (which is why they were the people he threatened to harm, of course.) But I feel like once I get started, this post is going to steadily devolve into me just going on this long-winded diatribe about my asshole ex, and will thus detract from it's purpose which is to find out, was I actually wrong? Given his history and the fact that I told him I was going to do a thing I then proceeded to do, was I actually the asshole for showing up, police at the ready? There are some people who have a firm, \"You don't call the cops. You don't bring cops to my door.\" mindset. And honestly, I personally have a massive bias against police. But they exist for a purpose, and while I don't really think breakup-mediation is typically something they should have to be called-upon for, I also feel like it was the least worst of a bunch of terrible options.

I carry no emotional attachment whatsoever to my ex, I just simply feel bad. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little bit of context: I met my ex in college about 3 years ago. We dated for just less than a year. We had a few fights, but for the most part it was fine. I felt myself falling out of love with her for a while. During the summer, she went back home after the semester.  I got a job and met this other girl, who I just considered a work friend. A couple of months pass, I can tell I'm not being fair to my ex and I'm seeming distant, and she can tell too. This girl at work had been showing signs she was in to me, and aside from hanging out once I didn't act on them. But I couldn't change how I was feeling, and I didn't think it was fair to my ex to fake it for a couple of more months, so I called her and broke it off. It was really rough, for her at least. I feel really bad about it, but I was fine. I felt like I had already moved on emotionally. It was also her brother's birthday, which made things worse for her and her family I'm sure, but I just feel like I couldn't lie anymore. I didn't want to wait. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI ended up going out with the girl I met at work not long after, and we're very in love. We have been dating since. I did move very fast after. Sometimes I think about how I ended it with my ex though, and feel bad. I'm sure she has since moved on, as have I. Maybe it's just selfish of me to think about it and maybe I'm bothered with the image of myself being an asshole, rather than the actual thing I did... I'm not very sure. All I know is I feel bad about how I did it, but not sure what else I could have done. Maybe waited a day? Probably.

Disclaimer, the guy I\u2019ve been bringing home knows my ex exists and knows he stays at my place but I don\u2019t tell my ex anything. \nSo the background is that me and my ex were together for 3 years, we have a child together, and overall I think he\u2019s a good guy, he\u2019s intelligent and stable so a month ago we moved out for the very first time to a big city in an apartment. Neither one of us knowing anyone in the city, knowing he\u2019s from Indiana and I was moving from 40 minutes away, it was a dream to be in a city this big. \nHe works in food. And I get it, the time you come home always varies when you work a full time schedule and you close and work with shitty people. His job sucks and he works 30 minutes away so I try to not say anything to him when he comes home at 2:30 am. But when I would bring it up we would always fight because he has a history of cheating on me in the past multiple times so of course I worry and his argument is always \u201cwe just moved, I don\u2019t know anyone here.\u201d But then it kept happening. He\u2019s a recovering alcoholic. About 3 weeks ago he went back to how he use to be in the beginning of our relationship. Every time he stayed out late he\u2019d come home more drunk than the last night and I\u2019d be worried sick about him. \nI\u2019m not the obsessive type but I just can\u2019t sleep until he\u2019s home so I\u2019d stay up til 3-4 am sometimes when I work mornings. I started a new job and that was the night he decided to come home at 2:15 am when I had to be up in 5 hours for my first day. It was a big deal. So I looked it up and his work closed at 9. So there\u2019s no reason it\u2019d take that long. I worried so much that I had this horrible pain in my stomach and ran to the bathroom and there was a huge amount of blood. Come to find out I had a miscarriage. So I texted him I was bleeding and in pain and he ignored it and said sorry that his phone was on silent and that he\u2019ll be home soon. That was at 1:35 am so he shows up at 2:15 am. He said he was at a pub and that he was sorry and proceeded to ignore me and stumbled to the bathroom to get in the shower and then broke a shelf trying to get in and tripped and knocked all the shampoo in the bath. We had an argument and like every argument we\u2019ve ever had in the entirety of our relationship it\u2019s me trying to talk to him and then him turning into this person I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s been doing this new thing though where I get mad and his responses are \u201chm? WHat? I don\u2019t know what you said\u201d so I stormed into the bedroom and told myself I was over it and that to forget about it and go to sleep.\n I check Instagram and I\u2019m nosey so I\u2019m always checking to see what my friends are liking and I see he started following a stripper from a stripclub that is 3 minutes down the road from us. So I go back in the front room and confront him and he says it\u2019s not important and that I need to go to bed and I\u2019m the most annoying bitch he\u2019s ever met. So all the nights the past month he\u2019s been at \u201cpubs\u201d he was really at this stripclub. Granted I tried to let it go. He\u2019s 22, he has the right to be there and drink. But going alone to a stripclub let alone talk to a stripper enough to get her instagram is a entire different story to me. \nSo we fought and he pushed me for \u201cyelling\u201d because he\u2019s the type of person that thinks people are responsible for their emotions which is true to a point. \nSo fast forward to now. He never apologized or put some light on the topic. I\u2019ve considered myself single every since that day and I\u2019ve been going on dates with this guy. But my ex still lives with me. He comes home and acts like we\u2019re dating and I made it to where I didn\u2019t let him touch me or call me honey anymore and he slept on the couch for about a week before he came home drunk one night and came into my room and threw himself on me. I was really mad but I let him do what he wanted and then we slept together and the next morning I was happy. But I\u2019ve promised myself I\u2019m never going to date him again. \nMy best friend came over about 3 days ago and she knew everything and she hates my ex now. We were sitting on the couch so my ex does this thing where he\u2019s a smug asshole and says we\u2019re dating and expects things from me. He kept calling me honey in front of her and told me to be safe and have a good day with my other boyfriends and said if I didn\u2019t stop being sassy he\u2019d give me \u201ca finger later\u201d. Guy thinks he\u2019s a total comedian. So he stood and stared at me while me and my friend were putting makeup on (I\u2019m obviously ignoring him because he\u2019s leaving for work and wants something) so he bends down to kiss me and I let him without looking. I\u2019ve told him we\u2019re not dating. And he says we are and he won\u2019t move out so I play his game. I watch movies with him, I let him touch me, I let him do what he wants. But I\u2019ve been going on dates with this guy I really see something with. I haven\u2019t told my ex anything but I really want this guy to stay the night especially because he doesn\u2019t have a tv and there\u2019s some classics I want to watch with him but I\u2019m scared of the outcome. My friends say bring him over and tell my ex to fuck off but they\u2019re in college so I think they\u2019re just being dark about the situation. \nAlso: the apartment is in my name I think that\u2019s essential. \nAITA?

I check my mystory (Mystory on snapchat is basically a timeline where when you put out something EVERYONE in your friend list can see it) where my friend and her boyfriend talk about how I gave him a handjob. She thought it was hilarious because I was gay and he didn't mind. I was ashamed and told her to apologize for me. he said it was alright\n\nSo the next day at school, we talk about what we did during our respective weekends. I show them the mystory, and one of my friends is like \"omg, I know that guy!\" She then proceeds to snitch on me, telling it to both of them, and my friend and her boyfriend tears me to shreds on messenger for an hour straight. The main problem here seems to be that ive began \"spreading rumors\" of what happened\". \n\nEventually her boyfriend admits that he overreacted and apologizes but she is still being a bitch. Like what the hell? Lets look at the facts here\n\n* I retold a story which she put out on MYSTORY for everyone to see\n* Her boyfriend was cool with it and apologized for being so angry\n* Since its her boyfriend that was the victim, why is she STILL angry when he said it was fine?\n\nThis is so shitty because she's told all of our mutual friends and i've been blocked by like 20 people on snapchat, which is basically half of all my friends.

I am very friendly but I often say things that are a bit over the line and I rarely back down because when I see myself in the right ill stand by that.\n\nSometimes there's something I do/say that triggers a reaction from my parents. Usually its something I see as very mundane and unimportant but they will usually say that its really hurting them.\n\nI used to be quite depressed and getting out of that, together with validation through grades in school and a lot of friends who quite like me, I've come to like myself and see that I'm an intelligent, likable guy and when people tell me otherwise I'm quick to reject that idea.\n\nMy sister (F/15) is an incredibly fragile person. Shes in therapy because everything stresses her out so much and she really hates when we fight (we as in anyone in the family). However, she often has phases (not her period) where she is just exhausting, telling everyone off and being completely toxic. That behavior isn't recognized my mom and usually hits me. My sister sees these phases as completely justified and never apologizes, instead wants apologizes made to her most of the time.\n\nI sit in my room most of the time, studying or playing games. I listen to music a lot (speakers except when people are sleeping). I do sports 6/7 Days a week and do a little bit in the house (my room is always clean, emptying the dishwasher, bringing out the trash, basic chores).\n\nWhenever I have a rough day and say something even remotely hurtful or annoying, my family completely loses it, especially my sister, and I am first blamed, then punished and when I inevitably apologize, its back to normal.\n\nSo I have two examples that I remember really well here:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst one we were on a 3 day holiday in London, my sister had had one of her bad days and we went out to eat. I was fine the entire time and didn't intentionally say/do anything to hurt someone. We went inside a traditional Chinese restaurant and having had Peking duck before, I said I want gonna eat anything and Id just have a drink. I said this while being calm since I didn't feel like it was a big situation. I just didn't want to eat Peking duck (what my family decided to order).\n\nThen my sister got up and went (quickly) out of the restaurant, followed by us. She then proceeded to run away, my mom following her and yelling at me to stay where I was and eat with my dad. My dad also went somewhere so I was alone in the street, confused.\n\nLater I was told (and am still being told) that it's my fault cause I made a scene and I should've just eaten and I knew my sister had a bad day. My mom yelled at me and I genuinely didn't see how anything was my fault but she guilt-tripped me for the remaining 2 days straight. (This is the situation where I am 100% sure I'm not the asshole, the other one is more intense so this post isn't baiting for validation.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo then yesterday, my sister took my headphones out of a drawer downstairs (which I didn't know, I thought they were in my room) and studying for the midterms and having to look for them I was angry cause I wanted to hurry to the gym.\n\nWhen my sister arrived home shortly before I was gonna go (i was already in my car). I drove off, turned around, handed her the keys, took them back after the opened the door (took them back in an aggressive manner) and told her \"don't go through my shit, asshole\" which in German sounds like I told her she's a fucking asshole.\n\nSo when I got back, my mom greeted me by telling me that I am a terrible person and that I made my sister cry.\n\nWe then yelled at each other cause that's what we always do. I said she was like her mom (rly bad) and she told me I didn't fit the family, I am ungrateful and I should move out.\n\nApart from that situation: She constantly mentions that I should get a girlfriend, that I should move out, that I should get a job, that I'm ungrateful, that all my problems are caused by me and that I should \"just be nice.\" cause they are nice to me.\n\nI just feel like I can't express my emotions to them anymore and everything I say is always taken up as something more than it is. My mom says everything I say hurts her and she doesn't see any fault of her own.\n\nAnother example of why I have a problem with her is, that I want to eat better and lose weight (did it before, wanna do it again) and said that I would like for her to consider that when she's cooking. She says that I have no right to complain and if I don't like it, I don't have to eat it. I get around 30\u20ac pocket money after gas and Spotify are paid for and I don't get compensated for buying my own food (which I already do, just not lunch every day). An argument she has is that she doesn't need to waste time cutting shit in the kitchen when I go out to McDonalds and subway on the weekends but I rarely do that and most of the time I just have a water and hang out with friends.\n\nI believe my family knows I like to lash out a little bit and they should accept that. If I do lash out, they can just tell me because I don't have bad intentions and id appreciate them stopping me right away. What usually happens is my mom or occasionally dad yelling back and then it gets really heated.\n\nMy mom has already made plans for me to move out. They support me generally but I can't have any complaints ever. My mom said that, if I do have a complaint, I should just suck it up.\n\nWe are relatively wealthy, my mom and dad have rough childhoods and I was incredibly difficult from ages 5 to 15.\n\nMy best friend (for 12 years, who knows my family well) agrees with me but I think that he's biased. What does Reddit think?   \n\n\nAlso: I am currently in the process of seeking professional help for myself and as a family therapy thing. I want to talk about the problems I and my mom have instead of just sucking it up and putting another fight off to another day. She doesn't think that I have any ground to stand on and says the problems are all with me.\n\nThe descriptions are all from my perspective obviously but I am generally pretty neutral and I really want to understand this better.

I'll do it for photographed occasions now and that's pretty much it. I'm occasionally mildly self-conscious about it and then I remember that body hair isn't a crime and life goes on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA year or so ago, I asked my boyfriend how he felt about me \"pulling the chute\" as I'm told it's called and was surprised (and a little sad) that he told me he finds it less attractive. We've been together for 8 years and I had been letting it grow longer and longer before bothering to shave for the last few years really, and he never said anything about it (maybe wisely since I'm all about that \"you don't get to tell me what to do with my body\" stuff). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThing is, he never says anything the other way either. He doesn't ooh and ahh or give me more calf rubs when I do shave my legs, I wouldn't even guess that he noticed. But he says he does notice, and finds it more attractive when I shave them. I guess since to me it feels like a stupid, pointless, socially imposed job that only women have to do, and doesn't actually benefit anyone practically, I don't want to spend time on it. And so my proposal was, if you want me to do it, you gotta show some appreciation when I do!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut that never happened, so a few months later, I offered up a second alternative: my legs can be silky smooth as often as he's willing to put the effort into shaving them! I thought it was kind of a sweet plan. He gets what he wants but also has to do the labour to get it, so he can understand there's a time cost for what he enjoys, if minor. So we did that for a while but it petered out and I've had furry legs for two months or so now. It isn't like it's an issue on a regular basis but I guess I wonder if this is one of those things where I'm being a jerk for not spending a little extra time to do something nice for this dude, or if he's in the wrong for wanting shaved legs but not appreciating them (now that sounded childish on my part. I'm leaving it in. It's a childish question anyways). This is very much a molehill, and not a mountain.

My parents and I have always had a shaky relationship, mostly due to the fact that my parents have a toxic style of parenting, as phrased by my therapist. \n\nThis takes place over this past Friday and Saturday. My parents decided that they wanted the 9 of us to watch several hours of family videos over these two days and I didn\u2019t want to. As I explained to them, watching the videos with me in them always result in my parents/siblings taking shots at my masculinity and making fun of me for sensitive topics that have been recorded on camera. Additionally, one of these videos was my circumcision and I really don\u2019t feel comfortable watching that video, nor do I with my siblings seeing this (Don\u2019t ask why this was videoed- I have no idea). My parents said that it\u2019s a family thing and I should suck it up and take part. Friday night, after dinner, my mom sets some videos up on our TV. Everyone goes to watch and I opt to sleep instead. Around 5 minutes after I went to bed, I was asleep. My father came into room and said that I need to come watch or I\u2019m grounded for two weeks. Thing is, I was asleep at the time, so I didn\u2019t respond. The next day, after a family lunch, my parents put some more videos on the TV. I began to head towards my bedroom and my dad said I\u2019m obligated to watch. He said I\u2019m grounded for ignoring his comments from the previous night (the ones I was asleep for) and I need to watch these videos. I told him that I wasn\u2019t going to watch them. He screamed at me, saying that I\u2019m less involved with our family than anyone else in the house and that I need to spend more time with them. I said that I\u2019m actually a huge part of the family, in fact I\u2019m  more a part of it than he is. He continues yelling, saying that I\u2019m wrong and I look for every opportunity to avoid spending time with my family. I responded by telling him that there\u2019s a difference between wanting to spend time with my friends and ditching my family. Seemingly ignoring my calm tone of voice, he continues his shouting, now saying how I\u2019m avoiding my responsibilities and an all around piece of shit. He claimed that no one\u2019s ever told me that because I\u2019m so controlling and I\u2019d snap at them if they did. I sarcastically asked \u201coh, so you\u2019re the saint who\u2019s going to speak for everyone and take on the wrath of the enraged fagaaron?\u201d He yelled at me for being disrespectful so I, knowing that he\u2019s a deep down sensitive man, said that I\u2019d trade him in for my best friend\u2019s dead dad any day of the week. With that, I went to bed and was ignored by him for the rest of the day. \n\nThat\u2019s my story, Reddit, so with that I ask:\n\nAm I the asshole?", "output": "EVERYBODY", "category": "Ethics Classification 1125.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, identify who is wrong here.

I'll keep it short and sweet here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo for some backstory, our shower has for 2 years leaks through the floor at random.

My dad has the idea that it leaks when there's someone in the shower showering (why that makes a difference idk) but he's never got to test it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere I am showering with the curtain closed and my dad knocks on the door. He asks me to open the door and let himself in so he can figure out why the shower is now deciding to leak into the floor below. I tell him I'll be out in 5 min but he insists, so I reach my hand out of the curtain and reach around till I get a grip on it and open it then close the curtain. He walks in and goes into a usual 5 min rant about where it could be coming from and how, so I tune out for a bit. Suddenly I feel a hole open up in the curtain right next to my ass and an iPhone pokes through while recording. I'm quickly turn around and tell him to please not film while I'm in the shower and he removes the iPhone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple seconds later I'm still expressing to him how it's really weird to do that and he sticks the iPhone back in while saying I'm not in the frame. Now I'm pissed and start yelling for him to shut it off now and how inappropriate it is while your TEENAGE SON is showering and he's sticking a camera to try and film some stupid leak. He shuts off the camera and leaves the bathroom. I finish showering and while in my room he tries to explain how I wasn't in the shot and wanted to see that particular scenario while the shower was running. I respond and tell him how violated I feel when someone sticks a camera into the shower while ignoring my continuous requests to turn it off and tell him to try to re create it another time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI thought my mom would react differently and be guilty and apologize but nope same reaction, how it wasn't meant to film me and they wanted to re create the scenario. She said the ceiling problem is \"$1000s of dollars\" and they needed a way to figure out the problem. I told her I didn't care and felt violated and embarrassed for recording me **while I was showering**. She stopped responding to me when I asked how she would feel if I were to poke a camera through her shower without warning while I recorded and ignored her requests to turn it off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR had privacy exposed because my parents wanted to diagnose a shower leak while I was actively showering.

I apologize if this post seems to be in shambles, it's late and this question has been tearing me up inside lately.\n\nSo I, Bob, am a bisexual man. I came out while at college, and during this time I got really involved in my college's Queer Student Union. That's where I met Susan. We instantly clicked. We had all the same interests and loved the same books and bands. I knew she was asexual when I first met her, but despite that I sorta started falling for her.\n\nBy the end of my sophomore year, I found out that despite being asexual, she was still romantic and still craved intimacy and romantic relationships. At this point, she was a close friend, and since we had so much in common, I decided to go for it. \n\nFast forward to now we're becoming really serious, and I think that's what has caused potential permanent abstinence to set in. I haven't had the guts to attempt to initiate anything because I knew she was asexual before we started, but I don't know whether it's \"repulsed by sex\" asexuality or \"never initiate\" asexuality, but I'm afraid of pushing her boundaries and ruining both our relationship and our friendship by being pushy.\n\nI'm a virgin. I'm Catholic and the emotional crisis I went through before realizing I was bisexual meant I never tried anything with anyone because I was too scared over the possibility that I might be gay. When we started our relationship I thought no sex wouldn't be an issue cause I'd never had it before, but I'm realizing that was a naive assumption. Now that I'm comfortable with my identity, I want to experience that part of life, but I don't feel I can if I stay with Susan.\n\nShe's the first person I've ever been in love with, and that love was built on the foundation of our friendship beforehand. But, even though we love each other now, I think we'll end up resenting each other if I don't end it now. At that point, not only would the relationship end, but our friendship too. Even if she was willing to have sex for my sake, I'd feel like I was manipulating her because she wouldn't actually want it. Yet, at the same time, I feel like only a complete shitty asshole would break up with their best friend when they feel so strongly for each other over something as minor and selfish as sex.\n\n**TL;DR: Girlfriend is asexual and I knew that going in.

They hug and kiss every single person when they arrive and hug and kiss when they leave the event. His family is always together and thoroughly enjoy socializing until the sun comes up (literally).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy family is the opposite.  I guess we don't really have cultural social traditions like my boyfriend does. We rarely go to parties because my parents just prefer not to. Both of their jobs are extremely social (Mom is an ER Nurse and my dad is a police officer) so they just want to come home and relax. I never had to socialize with other people besides school and work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, him and I have been together for a year and his family absolutely loves me and I love them too. I am always invited to any social gathering they go to. I went to thanksgiving with them at their uncles house and I felt so left out I  never wanted to go to another gathering with them again. When we walked through the door, I was greeted with tons of hugs and kisses from people I don't know, which makes me extremely uncomfortable. I do NOT like being touched by strangers, and I hate being forced to do so. I sucked it up and started the night off with some wine to calm some my nerves and some anxiety. It only got worse from there. His friends and family don't prefer to speak English and that is the only language I speak. So my boyfriend had to translate for me or summarize the conversation while I just sit there and nod with a smile. I wanted to go home. They kept asking him things about me in their native language when they could have said it in English to me. His family knew I was uncomfortable the moment I had to hug and kiss everyone, and his sister pulled me aside and said \"Its our tradition, you need to get used to it.\" I got mad and said \"Well that is not MY tradition.\" Which now that i look back on it, i feel really disrespectful about. My boyfriend did not leave me side and tried to comfort me as much as he could, but I am not a very social person-- i cant even be social if they aren't speaking to me in English. I've even tried to pick up on some phrases to try to talk to them. They even expected me to stay out until 3/4 in the morning. I said no and I wanted to leave. I had enough. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe entire night made me feel uncomfortable and my boyfriend knew that. I don't want to go to other social gatherings with them again. I have told them I get some pretty bad social anxiety in situations like those and all they said was \"get well!\". I don't think they understand very well, as they don't have that issue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(This is also just one instance there have been multiple)", "output": "NOBODY", "category": "Ethics Classification 1125.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, identify who is wrong here.

This is more complicated than it sounds.\n\nMy wife and I have been illegally subletting our apartment from my mother. It's the apartment my mom and I moved to when I was in my late teens. Sometime after that, my mom moved out and we started subletting from her.\n\nMy mother has a long history of being emotionally abusive and my relationship with her is extremely strained, but it's a really sweet apartment in a good area and has been rent controlled for fifteen years.\n\nI seriously doubt my mom is going to evict us for practically any reason because that would involve giving up her last source of control over my life and allow me to finally go full No Contact. Which I happily would, and she knows it. \n\nSo I'm not interested in practical advice on that front.\n\nAnyway, my mom's lease says no smoking and no pets, but the real landlords have always been extremely laid back.\n\nWhen my mom and I first moved here, the official superintendents were obvious full-on tweakers who left used needles lying around their porch. The people who replaced them smoked a big hookah indoors.\n\nAs for pets, there has usually been more than one tenant with at least one cat. The last time the actual landlord was here, she was worrying that there weren't enough cats on the property to control the rat problem.\n\nSince then, the true landlord has come down with dementia. I think she technically still owns the place, but some corporate entity is overseeing it. I'm not sure exactly what the deal is. \n\nMy mom says she once went to the proxy-landlord and started tentatively asking probing, \"hypothetical\" questions about subletting, and they were like, \"Stop right there. We don't want to know. We just want rent.\"\n\nMy wife and I both smoke a lot of marijuana, myself for my panic attacks and my wife for her chronic pain. My wife has a fused spine. She is extremely stiff in the morning, and has a lot of trouble getting outside to smoke before she's had her morning smoke. \n\nNonetheless, we avoided smoking in the apartment for the first couple of years we were subletting.\n\nThen, one winter, my wife was sick, and I couldn't get her to drag herself outside, so I put a fan in the window and we smoked in the bedroom, and it was downhill from there. \n\nBut for a whole year, we were able to keep the smell from collecting in the walls by putting the fan in the window whenever we smoked. In fact, we were able to control the smoke to the point where when my mom dropped by, she couldn't tell. There were times when we had ten minutes to air the place out before her arrival, and she still couldn't smell it. \n\nAnd in fifteen years, none of the real landlords or proxies thereof have come barging in on short notice the way my mom does. \n\nMy wife didn't like the fan, especially during the winter, but I would fight with her to use it. \n\nThen, one day, I got sloppy, and I got caught. \n\nMy mom was furious. I explained to her that we had been able to control the smoke for a whole year, and she hadn't noticed. I explained to her that if she'd given me just ten minutes warning, she wouldn't have noticed that day.\n\nI also explained my wife's chronic pain issues, as I had before. \n\nMy mom sneered at me and said \"World's smallest violin.\" \n\nNow for some background. My mom has seldom hesitated to ask for concessions on account of her health problems. When I was an adolescent, she denied me access to public education, completely failed to homeschool me, and screamed at me nonstop for an hour every time I woke her up from a nap. She justifies this in terms of her chronic fatigue syndrome and my supposed autism, the latter of which has been diagnosed only by her. \n\nAnd what she had to say to the 19 titanium screws in my wife's spine is \"World's smallest violin.\"\n\nAt that point I wasn't going to thanklessly fight with my wife on her account. We completely stopped using the fan. \n\nSo now apparently the whole apartment smells like weed to those who aren't scent blind to it. Whenever my mom comes around, she starts going ballistic about it and demanding that we give her a deposit and saying the deposit won't be enough and the landlord is going to sue her when we move out. \n\nMind, we never signed anything when we moved in here, least of all anything relating to a deposit. This is an illegal, under-the-table sublet, as with all three units in this building.\n\nI also have my doubts about my mom's lawsuit fears. No one has ever had a problem finding smoker tenants for this place, so I doubt they'd bother suing anyone over having to do that. When we leave, I reckon they'll still get more money because the rent control will reset, but if they wanted to bother evicting us, they'd have cause regardless because of the sublet.\n\nAnd because of the cat, but we won the fight over the cat with my mom years ago. \n\nAITA? \n\n", "output": "AUTHOR", "category": "Ethics Classification 1125.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, identify who is wrong here.

Theirs was an open relationship, and I was attracted to A, so I thought, \u201cWhy not?\u201d They had limits\u2014his ex was okay with manual stimulation: oral and penetrative sex were off-limits. We went further than that. (B was a childhood friend of mine, which makes it worse IMO.) I fully realize I\u2019m 50% the asshole (50% because it takes two to tango) in that scenario &amp;amp; I cannot even fathom cheating ever again, and I haven\u2019t. \n\nAfter I confessed to B that we had cheated (I needed to tell her the truth; I hate lying and felt awful for her), she and A had a constant on-and-off-again relationship. \n\nTheir relationship was toxic even before A cheated; they were very codependent. (I\u2019m talking \u201cB posted an old video of them kissing on her public Instagram the day after they broke up the first time, saying she hated life without him and that she was crying &amp;amp; A replied in a similar manner\u201d codependency.) B was verbally &amp;amp; psychologically abusive, whereas A was mostly psychologically abusive (manipulation and gaslighting\u2014he did the same to me &amp;amp; took advantage of my mental illness to convince me that I was delusional). \n\nB would text me often. She has a traumatic past &amp;amp; tends to masochistically engage with people who have hurt her, so I tried to minimize contact as much as possible once I realized this. She shared intimate details with me, including that she was in love with this guy she called her \u201cmuse\u201d and considering moving in with him. She later had sex with him. This was during a time when she was back together with A. \n\nI was still into A (hadn\u2019t realized he was toxic yet), so when B dumped him &amp;amp; made him promise to never talk to me again (threatening him with punishment if he contacted me or I contacted him) since \u201cshe didn\u2019t want him to move on, especially with me,\u201d I flew off the handle and said she was controlling him &amp;amp; had no right\u2014especially since they were broken up. I went to bed fuming. \n\nThe next day, I shared everything on social media she\u2019d told me not to tell A, since he followed me &amp;amp; if I contacted him directly he\u2019d be punished (plus I was pissed). I didn\u2019t include insults in the post; her actions spoke for themselves. I admitted that I had cheated in the post as well. \n\nB then blamed me for her heroin relapse (I shit you not), amongst other awful things.

He cheated, i caught him, we tried to work through it but it blew up so we separated and went to see counselors and have worked through everything. \n\nSo before all of that happened my husband and i had been getting really close with one of my husbands coworkers and his wife and family. We hung out a lot, at least once a week and we texted every day. We would have them over for holidays and even if my husband was working I'd go hang out with them without him. \n\nMe and his coworker really became good friends more than me and his wife because we had a lot in common and the main thing was we had the same sense of humor. A kind of raunchy humor and we would send each other funny videos or memes all the time. \n\nBut they were really like family. If we needed advice, we'd go to them. If they needed anything they could come to us. \n\nSo when I caught my husband cheating I was devastated. I went to them and confided a lot in them. As my husband and I tried to work through it they were there for us helping us both with all the things we were feeling. But when it all blew up and we separated they immediately boxed me out. It was radio silence. I reached out to them and nothing. They never answered the phone or called back or replied to my texts. They were my only friends so I was completely alone. They never once were there for me.\n\nSo after me and my husband started to figure things out and started living together again they invited my husband to a bar/restaurant. I said I wasn't ready to see them again so I stayed home. When he got there they started begging him to invite me. I said no but I was trying to put my best foot forward for my husband and I eventually caved and went. \n\nI was not very nice. I basically gave them the cold shoulder. They asked how I was doing and I said I was doing fine on my own. And then they got defensive. He(coworker) said the reason they picked my husbands side was because they work together.

Not any real conversation just memes. I'd say lol or funny but I eventually stopped replying altogether. \n\nIt went on for a bit but I got tired of all these raunchy videos.

One of them has been so frustrating to live with. My grandma owns the place so she rents it to us for 500 a month (pretty fucking good imo). That's only 170 a month and i'm really appreciative of this. The first battle that started, is how often his girlfriend is over. The agreement was 3 nights a week. My thinking was anything over that is half the month and thats not fair to not pay anything. That's for any guest, that way I wasnt singling her out, but i've known my friend for a long time and know how he is. So of course, here comes the first battle. She starts staying 4-5 nights a week. Months of endless battles about this. My grandma is the one renting it to us, so I felt it was her decision. I didn't feel like it was my place. It pissed her off as well, but all he would do is apologize, say he understands and would do something about it. It'd get better for a couple weeks, then rinse and repeat. I eventually just gave up. My grandma is just too caring and forgiving so I was like, whatever.... so now. The new problem that i've just been letting go one without saying anything. For that past 2 months I have refused to stop cleaning. The kitchen that is. I have been the only one to ever take the trash bags out to the bin. I also stopped buying groceries, so i dont use dishes. Take note, theres not a single time where his girlfriend has helped clean. So i got tired of cleaning up their shit. Other roommate doesnt want to clean for the same reason, doesn't buy grocies so doesn't use dishes. So now there's constantly so many dishes in the sink they're on the counter and like 5 trash bags in the floor. Just because you don't fucking \"live\" here i guess you cant make a mess. Huh? Well.

I forgot why, but I guess something inside me just went off. I live with her and have for a while.\n\nI have two younger sisters and a father. A few months before I stopped talking to my mum, she kicked out my sisters without any notice, just as they got home from school. My parents divorced and had a messy marriage. My dad was physically abusive and narcissistic, but I still do see him and even talk to him, especially when I'm studying with him. Both sisters live with him.\n\nDuring the divorce, my mum was awarded both the 7-bedroom house and his investment property. And from what I was told, she nearly got his current flat, but I won't get too much into how she didn't get it, as legality may be a bit confusing.\n\nNow, my mum is clearly not taking it well. Sometimes I feel sorry and bad for her, sometimes I just feel extremely annoyed and not empathetic. I suspect that a year before I stopped talking to my mum, she prevented me from seeing my dad, but she denies this. I had proof, but that phone broke, and now I have to depend on my memory, and I've been made to believe that I remembered things wrong.\n\nEvery time I look at her, I just feel mildly angry. Her state consists of noticeable liposuctions and cosmetic surgeries. To me, she is a daily reminder of where all the money that she claimed to not have for me to shower daily and have heating, went. From what I know, she never worked a full-time job in her life. There's always an excuse.\n\nThen again, she does take care of me and buy me clothes. Even though I cook my own meals and take care of myself, she has and still does her part.

Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)\n\nOur waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.\n\nAt the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.\n\nThe only one not happy was my date. She said, \"If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't.\" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night.

None are quite as *upscale* and highly rated as THE resort. \n\nTed works front desk at THE all-inclusive resort. It's flashy, instagrammable, and Ted gets a generous discount on the whole package. Ted and I have been to this resort before, when he first started working there, and although we had a great time, I wasn't impressed. \n\nThe day we requested full housekeeping, and specifically asked for a vacuum, they didnt vaccum, and left visable dust and gravel on our floors. The housekeepers left a open water bottle in our welcome basket. Their assumingly high dining standards, the $40 salmon plate was ...mediocre at best. The other food options weren't better. One night we ordered a certain game-themed pizza chain instead of eating the onsite food. \n\nI took it all in stride, and of course, told Ted I had a wonderful time, but next vacation I might want us to check out something new. My birthday rolls around, and Ted wants to take me on a getaway. He suggests the resort he works at. I  eventually say \"yeah we can do it one more time.\" \n\nSo Ted books the vacation. He wants to try a spa day, a chef's dinner. I love Ted, and it was all my birthday gift, so I don't want to say anything, but I didn't have a good time at all.

I realize how hoity-toity that sounds, but I have an IRON stomach, and I had it mild compared to Ted. Ted had to go splash his face halfway through dinner. It was bad. \n\nThe other.... odd thing about the vacation was that it was TED'S WORKPLACE. And Ted was non-chalant about it, but it really started to bother me. His supervisor checked us in. Ted continually called/stopped by the front desk for seemingly endless possibilities. Our spa day, he asked them to *tuck his jacket behind the counter*, despite the spa actually having lockers *for this purpose*. Everyone knew us. Someone saw us kissing and jokingly called across the lobby for us to get a room. It didn't feel like a \"just us\" time, alone, at a destination. It felt like \"Ted shows off\" or \"Ted hangs with friends\". It felt like that both times.

Lately though he\u2019s been telling me how he tells girls I\u2019m just a friend living with him but doesn\u2019t mention I sleep with him and have sex with him all the time. Normally I\u2019d let this go but he also gone as far as sleeping with one of them and comes back and makes fun of her for her size and tried to make jokes about how she desperately wants more with him and her attempts to win him over all while he laughs about it and doesn\u2019t understand why I get upset over that. I also talk to other males but I\u2019m honest about my situation so that they don\u2019t get into anything they don\u2019t wish to and can walk away if my situation makes them uncomfortable . At times I feel like exposing him to these girls he leads and especially the ones he comes back and belittles behind their backs. Some of the things he\u2019s said is \u201c this boulder keeps thinking if she offers me free stuff I\u2019ll fuck her again\u201d \u201cher body is like the bottom of a snowman does she really think I\u2019d want her that way\u201d. It really bothers me and I\u2019ve told him that when he puts woman down this way it makes me uncomfortable yet he still does it.Also I haven\u2019t done it and I probably won\u2019t because it\u2019s not my business and not my life but I just wonder if I\u2019d be the asshole if i did.", "output": "EVERYBODY", "category": "Ethics Classification 1125.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, identify who is wrong here.

I've known my friend for about 6 months now, but we practically have spent every waking hour together since not only do we go to the same college, were housemates, and we took the same classes. Pretty much I'm always around her therefor, and because of this, we have gotten to know each other really well, and we're good friends.\n\nThe guy she's been talking too wasn't always her boyfriend. While we were first getting to know each other, he was a friend. But even then, he called her all the time. She had to lie just so he wouldn't get mad at her for not picking up. They ended up kissing, and things of course got to where they are now. Now, she has to talk to him all the time.\n\nIn honesty, she has no idea if they are a couple, or just fuck buddies, or whatever you want to call it. It's super complex. Therefore, she's super afraid of losing him as a friend if they break up (or stop...doing whatever). I totally get it, although it's annoying since he tends to put her through hell since he knows that. If she won't pick up the phone for whatever reason, he'll get pissed off and will shut off his phone, not answer when she calls him back, call her a liar (albeit, she does lie about why she's not picking up the phone. Her reasons though are always really quite innocent, so I don't know why she lies. For example, one time she had a meeting, but told him she was in class), and not speak to her for days on end. This always irritates me since she comes to me, and is freaking out about it.\n\nSo, to keep him happy, she's started just going along with it. They talk *constantly.* I don't just mean like texting constantly, or checking up every hour or so, no I mean talking on the phone. For example, today, we had class at 8:30, so she woke up at 7. The second she woke up, she was on the phone with him. She went to class with him on the phone, hung up at 8:30, and when we left to go get breakfast at 9:45am, she talked to him the whole time we were at breakfast, and until she went to her next class. She had class again at 11, hung up before she went, and by the time I saw her at 2:15 (fifteen minutes after her class got out), she's on the phone again. She's been on the phone ever since then. It's 6:30pm.\n\nLast night, she was up until 3am, until she literally passed out on the phone, talking to him, and it was the same constantly talking as today. It annoys me so much, because if she doesn't do this, he gets pissed off and ignores her.\n\nEven though we've had arguments about the fact that he literally won't stop talking to her, it came to a bad last night. Last night, I had a PTSD flare up.  She came to me about 30 minutes into the flare up, stayed off the phone with him for like 5-7 minutes to help me...and went back and saw that she had 15 missed calls, and over 50 texts. Sometimes I need her, and sometimes she's not there because he's making her sit on the phone. Not to mention, she's having to do this. It pisses me off so much, but I feel like no matter what I say, this will keep happening.\n\nIt's hard for me to watch this happen. She doesn't want to talk to him all of the time, at least that's what she tells me, and I'm inclined to believe her.\n\nI'm not only pissed at her for never standing up for herself and her time, but I'm pissed off at him for doing this to her. One of our mutual friend's has told me to just drop it, and let it happen. I've gotten into screaming matches with her over this, and I don't want to get into another one with her over last night.\n\nI feel like I need to know if I'm an asshole for being upset in the first place. I just want her to see what's really happening.\n\ntldr; My friend's boyfriend makes her talk to him all day, never ending. It bothers me because I feel like sometimes I need my friend, and she deserves her space. I feel guilty for being pissed off, and arguing with her over this, but at the same time, I feel like she needs a reality check.", "output": "AUTHOR", "category": "Ethics Classification 1125.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, identify who is wrong here.

Originally I had the plan to drive her around a few memorable places but then the trip came up so we have to go on it, and then after go eat to celebrate. We find out she works the day of. Understandable. Then I ask about Thursday, it\u2019s a no because her brother has an event. That\u2019s understandable. Friday we can\u2019t because she works as well, thats okay. I ask for Tuesday, which I have plans to go out with friends to the movies but I haven\u2019t told her and would just cancel for this special occasion, but she says no as she doesn\u2019t want to wake up early and has to do chores and can\u2019t go out after 5 that day for a reason which I won\u2019t state but know it is actually really understandable. Saturday? She\u2019s going out with her friend at 7, and the morning she\u2019s waking up at 12 and then doing chores at 1 til 3, 4 is too late to take her out to eat while she\u2019s going out to eat at 7. Sunday? Nope, family day so no time. I understand that she needs time for her family. I told her about a dance we could go to with her family so that we can dance a little bit and she can have some family time but she doesn\u2019t want to as it is a school night and I would be interfering with the family time. Maybe tomorrow? I would be doing community hours but would cancel and let someone else take my spot for this special occasion. For a quick brunch? No, same as Tuesday. Next week? No, break ends and she doesn\u2019t want to go during school days, that\u2019s okay. Next weekend she\u2019s celebrating a relatives birthday, that\u2019s understandable. In 3 weeks? Maybe but won\u2019t be as important to her, just a normal date. She says either the trip counts as our celebration or no celebration at all. I got kind of pissed, but of course I\u2019m not going to blame her because it\u2019s just time she doesn\u2019t have so I\u2019m not taking it out on her and haven\u2019t showed her, just instead got bummed out. We were texting about it and she simply doesn\u2019t see why celebrate it as it\u2019s just a year. I said because it\u2019s a milestone, I believe 1 year, 10 years, and 50 years of anything are the most important. 2 and 11 and 51 don\u2019t hold the same \u201cevent-y\u201d feel. It\u2019s a ridiculous belief but it\u2019s important to me and I don\u2019t want to half ass it. She replied\u201c\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.\u201d All I said was \u201cokay i understand\u201d because we for sure aren\u2019t celebrating it with anything other than the(maybe together)school trip.

He cheated on me with my friend (he more than made it up to me, 4 years later we\u2019re married, very happy). That friend just happened to fall in love with him (he\u2019s really charming, tbh everyone wanted him). So that friend hid this affair from me until 3 years later when I confronted her? I had known for a while cause my husband had told me long before that. When I confronted her,I told her I forgave her and I didn\u2019t care about the past, she was being super defensive, I still forgave her cause I didn\u2019t wanna cause drama in our friend circle, Cause I honestly didn\u2019t care. After that, she just generally hated when me and my husband were together? She would tell me weird shit like he\u2019s not worth it, and don\u2019t be with him! (Let me add that she once came up to me before the confrontation, and tried to convince me that my husband, wasn\u2019t in love with me and was actually in love with her). I ignored it. \nTowards our last year of college she started being even more weird (me and my husband at this point we\u2019re super serious had made our parents meet and we\u2019re talking about marriage) she would go to my other friend and bitch about the me and my husband. Which was ridiculous cause she acted like she was totally okay in front of us.Let me add that at this point she had been distant from everyone no matter how hard we tried to involve her she always acted like she didn\u2019t care. Our friend group was really getting tired of her shit. After we graduated we had an engagement party like 2 months later and said friend also had the rep of getting too drunk and just wanting to party hard and puking everywhere and What not. I honestly didn\u2019t even feel like she was my friend anymore, and nor did I want her to come to my party with my family and my in laws and get drunk and ruin the whole thing? So I sent her a message explaining everything that made me uncomfortable about her and how I think it would be better if we weren\u2019t friends anymore (also she hadnt met me or talked to me since graduation). Honestly her energy and bad vibes were really affecting me. I told her everything nicely and she replied rudly After which I just told her I didn\u2019t want her at my engagement because I don\u2019t want bad vibes in my life specially at such a happy time. Then 9 months later when we were getting married, about a week before, she calls up my other friend (hadn\u2019t heard from her since the last interaction) and starts calling me a bitch and what not and saying I ruined her life and stole all her friends (I literally didn\u2019t care if anyone stayed friends with her, neither did I ever make anyone share my feelings about her or anything), and that I made everyone stop talking to her. I was shocked to hear such stuff! I always felt bad about not inviting her but I feel like I have my reasons honestly! Idk AITA here?

We dated back in the day for around 8 months when we both lived in our hometowns and parted ways when our lives weren't going in the same direction. Coincidentally, we both moved to the same city a couple years later and we reconnected and now have been dating here for about a year and a half.\n\nWe've been doing pretty well and we just moved in together, having signed a preliminary 6 month lease. I thought things were going great, he is in graduate school and is working a really awesome job on the side that is exactly what he wants to do, and I'm working full-time and just completed my application for grad school. He's been going through a really hard time recently, as his grandpa who raised him recently just passed two weeks ago. He spent around two weeks in his hometown surrounded by his family and friends before the passing and after, and I joined him for various parts of the process. He's been back for three days now and he just seems really down, which is understandable.\n\nHowever, today he dropped the bomb on me that he wants to be out of the city by June and wants to move back home to be with his family and friends because he says he's miserable here and he hates the city that we live in. He has never given me any indication that he hates this place, in fact all he does is rave about his job and I thought he really liked it here. He says he hates the people here, that he doesn't feel appreciated in his job, and that he has no friends and really wants to be around people that support him. So essentially, in my mind, he's willing to give up an awesome job and quit grad school to move back to a place that he used to complain about non-stop. I feel I should also mention that he does have mild clinical depression and he used to be treated, but is no longer on medication.\n\nThe thing that makes me the most angry is that he says he's been feeling this way since last November, way before I had officially decided whether or not I wanted to go back to grad school, and he knew this. I don't understand why he didn't tell me that he was feeling this way because had he, I might be more open to the idea of moving back home, but as it stands with my commitments, I don't want to go. I'm about to go over to his house to have a discussion with him about this, and I know I'm going to tell him that I don't want to leave. I love him, but I can't tell if he's throwing everything away to move back home, or if I'm throwing everything away with him by refusing to go with.\n\nWIBTA for not wanting to move back home with my boyfriend?", "output": "NOBODY", "category": "Ethics Classification 1125.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, identify who is wrong here.

It\u2019s not just a little pitchy; sometimes he just can\u2019t find the pitch at all and just throws a random note out there. He also likes to tackle more difficult songs than he\u2019s able to sing. He knows he has these issues but thinks that with a little daily practice in his car while commuting, he could get good enough to perform. I don\u2019t share that outlook.

Please hear me out first though.\n\nYour eyes/eyebrows and mouth are basically what make up your expression at any given time. The expression that you put off will sort of reflect onto whoever you are around and can affect their mood as well. Well I met this girl and have been talking to her for a short time. We've met a few times and she seems like a really cool person who shares some similar interests with me. She's also very beautiful but first thing I noticed about her was her eyebrows. They're arched really high (think St. Louis Arch) and then slant aggressively on the insides towards her nose. This being said, she has a permanent look of being surprised/angry/evil all the time. That's the best way I know how to describe it. I don't really know enough about eyebrows to know if hers just naturally look like that or if she styles them like that herself.\n\nAnyways, when I look at her, I can't help but feel like she's constantly surprised mixed with being mad/evil which ends up as me receiving a weird vibe although I know it's not anything she's doing intentionally.

Originally Annie asked me if Jonathan could come too, and I said no, because if I make an exception for a +1 for her, then everyone would bring a +1 and I didn't want the dinner to be too big. So Annie said that she wouldn't be coming then, and then me and my other guy friend basically called her out for ditching something that was planned far in advance (I made a FB private event 3 weeks before the actual dinner). 2 hours before the actual dinner she said she was coming and I thought that was the end of that.

Gary had a son, Zack, who was a year younger than Hayley, Hayley and Zack had actually gone to the same school together but didn't know it until seeing old school photos.\n\nThings seemed to be going fine in Hayley and Gary's relationship and she ended up moving in with Gary and his family.

First off, insecurity in itself is not a big deal, my friend group is basically the bunch of insecure weirdos nobody else wanted, but Marcy shows her insecurity at any time she can. She writes about how things are terrible, she calls all of us constantly, sends us upwards of 10 messages an hour even if we don't respond, and is generally exhausting.\n\nMarcy has been like this for about two months, mostly she has been insecure about her relationship, and her smoking, which is understandable. However, she always brings it up to the detriment of others. For example, I'm dealing with pretty severe physical/mental health issues, but every time I've tried to get advice she starts talking about her problems. She had a complete meltdown at my birthday party because she was angry at her BF, which I took in stride, but I'm getting seriously annoyed.\n\nIt would be one thing if me and basically everybody else weren't knee-deep in our own shit and drama, and if she didn't bug us constantly. I've replied and tried to console her every day from october up til last week when I just put her on mute, and started responding when I felt like it. It's really stressing me out, and everybody else is sick of it to. Her boyfriend, a close friend of mine basically broke down because she is getting to be impossible to be around. \n\nAITA for being really sick of her? I love her as a friend, but I don't want to help anymore. I've tried, but I'm sick of it, and my health is already going to hell without this drama.\n\nTL;DR: Friend is severely anxious and makes it my problem.

He said he could put her in the dining room and give me a key.\n\nI was appreciative but refused again. I emphasised just how much work went into looking after Snuffles. I would need to be there for *a* *minimum* *of two hours every single* *evening* playing with her, cleaning, preparing food, dealing with medical issues and clearing any mess she made. She is lovable, but also noisy, destructive, demanding and not house trainable. No matter what I said, he insisted it would be fine and that he\u2019d put up with it. He said verbatim that *he and his wife never used the dining room outside of special occasions and would only insist that I not be there later than 9pm*. I still said no. \n\nI was abruptly told that the far-away place was going to be given away if I did not accept. I texted my friend that I was going to take it. He called me back and yelled \u2018Don\u2019t! Our arrangement is so much better!\u2019 He said he\u2019d give me complete logistical freedom. On the basis of that, I accepted.\n\nIn hindsight, I think he pitied me, since I\u2019m down on my luck, and just said whatever would get me to agree to his idea. \n\nOnce I'd moved Snuffles into his house he did a 180. \n\nI said I would do my best not to intrude on special occasions, but could guarantee nothing and would usually be there between 5 and 8pm, which he accepted. I immediately got messages about how nice it would be if I left before 6pm, so we \u2018wouldn\u2019t be in each other\u2019s way\u2019. This would mean my dropping everything at 3pm or earlier on many days, which isn\u2019t possible. I told him so but he then *insisted* I *had* to be there early, especially on weekends. He talked about his family \u2018deserving to enjoy their own dining room\u2019. I understand, of course, but this directly contradicts what he said before. It turns out he hosts cookouts in the dining room on both weekend days as well, so I often have to give up much of my weekend to work around his guests.

He was depressed at the time and I helped him. A few weeks after we met he starts acting strange. He randomly complimented me, and things like that. And I was happy because I felt like I was helping him. He was a bit creepy tho, he once told me he was touching himself (wth..?) and things like that. After three weeks of knowing each other, he confessed to me, telling me that he's in love with me. And at first I didn't believed him. We've been knowing each other for a short time, and I thought it was weird that he fell for me. He also lives really far away from me, we don't even speak the same Language. Anyway, I told him that I don't feel something for him because it's too early, and that we should just wait a little longer. Now, I tried to tell him in the nicest way possible, but he didn't get it.\nWe kept talking, and I realized I'd never fall for him. He kept telling me he wanted me to be happy with him after I told him that we didn't need to be in a relationship to be happy and I just wanted to be friends.\nHe then started to make weird drawings of us kissing or hugging. At first I was okay with it, but after some time it started to make me feel uncomfortable. I felt like he was forcing me to be with him, but I didn't told him that, hoping that he would stop. He kept referring to us as a \"couple\" even tho I never really agreed on that, so I told him that he should first ask me if I want to be in a relationship with him. So he asks me to if I want to be his girlfriend, and I say no, because it's too early and, even if I feel something for him, it's not it the \"romantic sense\", and I hoped he would've understand. I didn't wanted him to be sad about it, so I didn't told him straight that I only saw him as a friend. And that was a mistake. The day after I rejected him, he sent me another drawing of us, knowing that it makes me uncomfortable, and then he starts saying things like: \"we are a beautiful couple. We feel the same way about each other, you're maybe just scared of how you feel but it's okay, we can make it, because we're in love\". Now, I'm a really calm person and I rarely get mad. But as I was reading this I knew I couldn't take it anymore.\nI told him that he clearly didn't understood what I meant the other day. I told him that I'm not in love with him, I'm not interested and I'll never be interested, and also that he needs to stop drawing us and referring to us as a couple because it's cringy and I absolutely hate it. We have a discussion and then he blocks me. So, that's it. I actually felt a bit bad that I attacked him like that, but he wouldn't understand. On the other hand, I feel like he's the one who should feel bad, because if he didn't made me feel like I was being forced into a relationship, we could've been great friends.

I do know that it is his body and his choices, but for whatever reason I get anxious and stressed about acne specifically.

Since I was already taking my girl Moony from Alex I said sure bring them both (note I do not drive).\n\nThe day after Thanksgiving Alex and her three boys show up and drop off the kitten, three hours after they said they would but not a huge deal because I was off work and I know its about an hour drive from my place to hers. I confirm again that it's only for two weeks and she'll pick her up in early December. Alex agrees and reminds me to spend lots of time with them both to make sure I'm keeping the right one (at the time I just knew I was keeping one, not which of the two girls it would be).\n\nAbout a week later I tell Alex that Moony will be stay with me and she says that's great, she'll come get Moony the following weekend.\n\nThe weekend she's supposed to pick Remy up she texts that something came up and it'll have to be postponed but this time she doesn't give me a date. Whatever the girls are happy and I'm falling in love with both.\n\nFast forward to the last weekend in December and Alex messages me asking what I'm doing for my bday on the ninth and I tell her probably just staying in and snuggling Moony. At this point she tells me I'll still have Remy then too, a little more than a month after Remy was supposed to go home. I think about it and then text her back that in that case I think I'd just like to keep both cats because they've bonded to me and each other and I don't want to separate them.\n\nCue the sob story about how her oldest misses his cat and wants her back and she's promised she will get Remy back soon. Mind you up until this point I've initiated all contact about the cats and sent updates, Alex has never been the first to message me about them.\n\nSo from here on I stop messaging first, I stop sharing pics of the girls where Alex can see them, and I rename Remy to Siri. Life goes on and about a month (early February) after that last convo I unfriend Alex on fb because I see no reason to keep up the charade of us being friends if she won't message me first.\n\nNow three weeks later Alex messages me that I'm an a-hole for kidnapping her cat and breaking her boys heart. She also called me a fake friend and said this was my plan all along, even though I was doing her a favor by even taking one cat in the first place (I didn't want a three month old kitten, I was planning on adopting one from a shelter that was at least a year old).\n\nSo am I the a-hole here?", "output": "EVERYBODY", "category": "Ethics Classification 1125.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, identify who is wrong here.

My grandmother is 91 and lives in a nursing home in a small city. The area where she lives isn't rural by any means, but it's not exactly accessible either. It's basically an all-day trip to get there (two flights), and when you arrive there's not really much to do given it's a small city. There's no meaningful public transportation, no Uber or Lyft, and what few cabs there are charge a fortune to take you anywhere. I don't know anyone there other than her.\n\nShe's actually doing pretty well for being 91, she's not bedridden or anything, but she basically just spends her days watching TV punctuated by going down to their dining room for meals. Her hearing isn't very good and she doesn't like wearing hearing aids, so conversations with her consist of you saying something and her responding to what she thinks you said, which usually doesn't like up with what you actually said. Make for a lot of awkward conversations. I think she's well-taken care of, the nursing home she's staying at actually sounds pretty nice. And other than her loss of hearing I think she's in generally good health.\n\nShe lives by herself, my grandfather died 5 years ago. After he died we tried to get her to move closer to family but she refused on the basis that her friends still lived in the city. But all her friends are dead now, so she lives by herself in this small, faraway town. The closest family is my uncle (her son) who is unemployed/on disability and lives 4 hours away. He rarely visits her despite having nothing going on in his life (his disability does not prevent him from traveling to visit her, and he has the means to do so).\n\nI used to visit her every year, but I stopped 3 years ago. It's a long and expensive trip to just go sit around and watch TV for a couple days. The last time I went I had such a miserable time I felt resentment toward her for not taking our advice and moving closer to family when she was able to (she says she's too old to move now which is probably true). I had never felt that toward her before in my life. I decided then to take a break from visiting her, because I didn't want to resent her, and I didn't think she would want me to resent her. That was 3 years ago.\n\nThe way I see it, we all have to live with the choices we make in life, and she chose to live in a city that's far away from family, so we can't be expected to visit her that much.\n\nI call her every single week without fail on Sunday evenings before she goes to dinner. Every week she asks me when I'm coming to visit and tells me she misses me and that she's not going to be around forever. Every week I tell her the same thing, which is that I'm definitely planning on it, which is a lie. Sometimes I cry after talking to her because I miss her to and I feel sad about the situation. I'm crying right now just from typing this. \n\nBut at the same time, whenever I think about visiting her, it stresses me out and makes me start feeling resentful toward her again.\n\nReddit: Am I the asshole for not visiting my grandmother?\n\n", "output": "AUTHOR", "category": "Ethics Classification 1125.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, identify who is wrong here.

I said that isn't a good idea, considering he was on day 3 of a very bad chest cold and currently has a compromised immune system. We live in a relatively populated area and I just don't think a sick baby needs to be at the mall, for various reasons. He argued with me about it, but then relented and said he agreed with me.\n\nToday, he stated  -- again -- that he wanted to take our son to the mall. This annoyed me, considering the fact that I already told him yesterday that I was uncomfortable with this and I reiterated the exact reasons why. He is still quite sick and has been having coughing fits where it is difficult for him to catch his breath.

He became very cold towards me and basically refused to engage further in the conversation until I relented and allowed a compromise of taking a short walk outside instead, if the weather wasn't too bad.\n\nWe then took a walk with our sick toddler outside where it is -10 with the wind chill. I expressed that I didn't think it was a good idea to go on this walk, but he continued ahead with our son, so I followed. When we arrived back inside the apartment, our son's face was alarmingly red and I began checking his skin because I was afraid he might have frostbite. My boyfriend then said: \"yeah maybe that wasn't a great idea, we're bad parents.\"\n\nI responded that this was not my idea. He said \"fine, I'm the bad parent.\" I didn't correct him.\n\nThis is not the first time we've had problems like this. I admit that I do have problems with anxiety, and my boyfriend frequently uses this against me.

These guests come over AFTER 10pm (when im normally in bed) and stay until the early morning. They are also loud, and I have a dog that barks when anyone enters the house. Roommate is an aspiring DJ and always playing loud music. He meets women on dating apps and has them into our home to spend the night, constantly. It used to literally be a different woman every day. Now its a new woman every week. He has no sense of cleanliness, meaning, he doesnt ever think anything is dirty therefore he doesnt care to clean.

For a while everything was cool, &amp; then one day she asked me if i wanted to live with her next year. At the time, i was still 17 because i\u2019d graduated high school early &amp; she was 20, so i thought it was a little strange, but i figured why not? Ya know? Mitchell would be there &amp; id have someone there to kinda help me out.\n\nFlash forward to summer, Cori lives 2 hours away from where Mitchell &amp; i live. He starts making trips out there and then being basically forced \u201cor so he said\u201d by her to stay. I don\u2019t care, i have other friends. Every time he does manage to come home, we get together &amp; he talks mad shit about the kinda person she is etc. says he wants to break up, you get it.\n\nHe breaks up with her for about a day, they immediately get back together. Flash forward to school starting, i meet our third roommate, call her Haley, Cori\u2019s best friend, &amp; i\u2019m kinda shy so we didn\u2019t become friend for awhile. \n\nDuring this beginning period of school, Mitchell gets pissed, breaks up with Cori, and then they get back together in about a week. This goes on for a couple weeks, &amp; he tells me that they\u2019re broken up, but it\u2019s cordial so he can still come hang out with me, he does, &amp; almost every time Cori would say some cryptic bull about \u201cneeding to talk to him\u201d in her room, &amp; they do that for 30 min- to an hour &amp; he tells me it\u2019s nothing, but i\u2019m not stupid, i know they\u2019re having sex.\n\nFinally they come back out as dating. Now here\u2019s where the main conflict starts, i found out later on that Cori used to go over to his house when they were \u201cbroken up\u201d &amp; tell him that she was going to kill herself, that he\u2019s the reason she\u2019s not eating, &amp; all this other stuff. She gets even more manipulative &amp; controlling, &amp; Mitchell starts staying &amp; basically living at this house that the 3 of us are splitting evenly in rent &amp; utilities. \n\nDuring this kinda in between period, like september to october, she\u2019s picking fights with me over him, saying rude comments, and generally just making me afraid to leave my room, (i actually stayed in my room for a full 36 hours at one point) and just forcing him to kinda put me out of his life. This was when Haley &amp; i became friends, along with her finding out from tons of mutual friends that Cori had been telling everyone that Haley was a slut etc., i got so angry one day that i threw all of Cori\u2019s chairs into our backyard, put them back, then went to my room &amp; punched a hole in my door. I thought I\u2019d broken my hand, Haley took me to the hospital, bam friendship was born. \n\nThings were iffy for awhile, just general bs. Haley would say she didn\u2019t want Mitchell at our house, Mitchell is literally living at our house. We\u2019d have a fight, they\u2019d stay at his place for a week or so, but they were always back. Plus, Haley &amp; i keep the house clean when it\u2019s just us, but Mitchell &amp; Cori are slobs, shit everywhere. Then Mitchell &amp; i started fighting, around Thanksgiving it gets really bad, i say i don\u2019t want him in my home, Haley doesn\u2019t want him in our home, &amp; i want his shit gone.\n\nThey leave to his house for a week. Mitchell &amp; i are no longer friends. Next week they\u2019re back, living at our home, Mitchell, at our home. Haley &amp; i decide to move out. Mitchell\u2019s &amp; my mutual friend, decided to move in with us. \n\nNext two months until yesterday we\u2019re busy getting our things in order for our new apartment. We find it &amp; start moving our things a few days ago &amp; yesterday when she saw us draining my waterbed our my window, she came out &amp; started screaming at us. \n\nWe took that load of stuff, dropped it off &amp; went back to get more, &amp; they had unplugged the garage door opener, put a handle on the front door (Mitchell had broken it &amp; taken it off with the intention of fixing it a few days ago &amp; then had just left it open) , had locked my bedroom window, &amp; locked the back door. Haley had to crawl in through the doggy door &amp; push the wood cover out of its slides. \n\nWhile Haley &amp; our mutual friend, let\u2019s call him Dawson, were moving out her wooden headboard, Cori &amp; Mitchell came to the garage door &amp; got into a fight with her where she said it was hers because it was made from materials on her ranch, &amp; Haley said fine, &amp; slammed the thing down on the floor of our garage, stepped on it, then tried to walk back into the house. \n\nHaley is not a huge fighter, but when she gets pissed she sees red, &amp; while she tried to walk in, Cori shouldered her hard, Haley automatically turned &amp; pushed her into my washing machine, and yelled at her. Mitchell has to keep them apart. About 15 minutes after that, there were two cops there, just \u201cmaking sure it went smoothly.\u201d We weren\u2019t there for that much longer, but the whole time Mitchell and Cori were out sucking up to the policemen.\n\nFound out later that they had already figured out where our new house was, we didn\u2019t want them to know, &amp; had toured it apparently. They\u2019re psychos. Just want to know if AITA or not.

I forgot about the old friend who was working there and when I got home, she snap chatted the sock and called me out by name and saying I was lazy. Even though I thought that she overreacted, I just replied to the snap saying, \u201cLol oops\u201d trying to think it wasn\u2019t a big deal.  Yesterday, I went to Target again and she says to me, \u201cRemember to put your sh** away\u201d before rolling her eyes. I was annoyed so I said back, \u201cGet a new job if you don\u2019t like it\u201d I said this while laughing kind of and walked away. Nothing else has happened but I feel like she overreacted but I don\u2019t know.

I come from a pretty simple family, our family's favorite restaurant is Outback steakhouse, my parents eat at Chili's when the travel across the country, their idea of exciting is seeing a new mall, even if all the stores are the same as we have in Tucson. I fucking knew this and i'm kicking myself. I have started drama and one thing my parents love is fucking drama. \n\nSo like I just said I'm from Tucson, AZ. I moved to NYC this past summer to pursue my dream of being a freelance photographer and am basically apprenticing with an older lady who has lived in the city since the 1950s. As such she has shown me the most amazing, off the beaten path things that you would never, ever get on a circle line tour. In over six months of being here, I've only been through times square, I haven't been to ESB or 1WT or statue of liberty. I've absolutely loved it. \n\nThis weekend my parents and two younger sisters came to visit me for the first time since it was a 3 day weekend. My mom was very clear that she wanted an \"authentic\" New York experience. I was like cool...lets do it. I got them a pretty sweet Airbnb just around the corner from the room I rent from my photographer friend in Brooklyn and set about. I knew there were signs of trouble when I took them to an absolutely amazing Italian place in Bensonhurst that is almost 80 years old. My sisters hated it because the menu was seafood and my mom lectured me that she KNEW that the only place for authentic Italian food is in Little Italy. I tried to tell her that as sad as it is, Little Italy is actually very touristy now and these people were serving dishes they learned from their family when the immigrated from Sardinia. Well the hated it and I saw at their Airbnb the next morning that all the leftovers were in the trash.  The next day was worse because we spent the whole day touring around Brooklyn and Queens and about 5 my sisters starting whining \"when are we going to see Times Square?\" I told them I thought that the wanted to see authentic New York. They told me all the stuff I was showing them was \"boring,\" sheesh thanks...these were all the places where I've done shoots.  \n\n\nSunday my dad's diabetes feet were acting up so they decided to just stay in the Airbnb all day Sunday and actually ordered in grubhub from Hooters. Fuck it, I went and did some work with and Instagram model I do TFP work with. Today I was like cool, lets just go see Times Square and Empire State and part of Manhatten but my mom was absolutely freaked the fuck out by the subway and was worried about getting to LaGuardia on time so we just came back and again spent the day in their Airbnb. My mom blamed me for not booking them a hotel or Airbnb in Times Square because she had no idea I \"planted\" them so far away from all the activity of the city. \n\n\nI just paid a fucking Mint to get them an uber to the airport and on the way my mom sent me an incredibly nasty email basically blaming me for allowing them to spend all their money and see \"nothing.\" I don't even know what to respond because I have email and text after email and text of her explaining to me that they wanted to see \"authentic New York.\" \n\n\nI can add more info as needed...but while I admit to being the Asshole for not acting on what I KNEW to be the reality, am I the asshole for acting on what the asked of me?", "output": "EVERYBODY", "category": "Ethics Classification 1125.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, identify who is wrong here.

Do I crush her dream by telling her I don\u2019t want her to?\n\nLater this year, I\u2019m [18M] planning to go on study abroad to the UK for about 4 months. My mother [46F] is very excited about this and has suggested we holiday around continental Europe for 2 weeks before I get to the UK. \n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong; I love my mum more than anything and our personalities are really compatible and we get along well. However I\u2019m not keen to go on holiday with her. \n\nFirstly, we just got back from a holiday overseas together (with other family) that was enjoyable but in no way relaxing due to us all liking different ways to travel. \n\nThis trip of studying abroad will be my first time living out of home and I was kind of hoping for it to be a discover-myself kind of trip and I feel spending two weeks straight in close company to my mum will not be a great start to that. \n\nAlso I can only be overseas for a certain amount of time due to medical reasons and the more time I spend with Mum the less I get to myself. \n\nHere\u2019s a summary of the reasons that I feel bad about not wanting to go:\n- Mum is super excited about it and I don\u2019t want to crush this dream\n- We are not rich and mum\u2019s more than willing to spend lots of money on the trip\n- My Mum had breast cancer last year and I feel like this is a pick-me-up she really wants. \n\nMum\u2019s brought it up around my grandma who thankfully said I wouldn\u2019t want to do that, which my mum unfortunately ignored. I\u2019ve tried to hint I\u2019m not super enthusiastic about it but have not explicitly stated I don\u2019t want it do it. \n\nShould I suck it up and go with her or tell her I don\u2019t want to do it? Before you roast me I know this is the most first-world problem ever but it\u2019s still a dilemma. \n\nAlso if it makes a difference I\u2019m paying for the study abroad with money I\u2019ve worked for myself.

A couple months ago he sent me what I would call a weird fetish but if he likes that I can't judge him anyways he \"accidentally\" sent me that on my phone (link to a video from Youtube I'm pretty sure its deleted) Anyways I thought it was weird and asked a couple close friends for advice and they said to not be his friend but the thing is that I always feel bad when I tell him I would like to stop being friends for a while because he gets pushed around a lot because of his past (I don't know what he did and they won't tell me)  Also he used to tell me to look at creepy things while we were at school for spring break, its an afterschool program and my parents wouldn't let me get out of it so I just went to it and there he was in some discord for hentai and porn which he would always tell me to look at while I was trying to do work the teacher assigned to us. (I was mainly just reading stories on don't sleep which definitely is not what our teacher assigned to us but still) I tried to tell him he was gonna get caught and I tried to tell him that we shouldn't be friends many times but each time I just felt too bad for him. He also talks a lot about hentai which I don't know how to feel about, I get it that I shouldn't judge him but if he doesn't want me to judge him then he shouldn't tell me about all his sexual fantasies. I was thinking about telling some people about what hes done to me. I've already told some people and they said that if I feel annoyed and he won't stop I should but I keep feeling bad for him. I'm thinking of showing ALL the proof I have of the stuff he does to me. I have text messages which he sent to me which I could easily show but a person who overheard me and my friends talking said that said that since it happened a while ago I should just forget about it but he still continues to lie. To be honest I think he lies because he has nothing interesting to say because he went to some \"party\" which he told me what happened and I realized he literally copied it from reddit. Once I was serious that if he keeps on lying to me then I would stop being his friend but he told me it was a lie. Today hes saying that its the truth and its getting really annoying. There is also this whole thing where he broke some kids phone and his parents/he refuse to pay for it so the kids friend is trying to fight him and I also know the kids friend. If he fights him he will get hurt since he can't run for long since he has asthma so that added to my guilt of thinking of not being his friend. If I do tell people then obviously I wouldn't be his friend anymore so I don't know what to do. If I'm not his friend then my friend will fight him and hurt him which I feel bad about so is there anyone who thinks I should stop being friends with him and take revenge?", "output": "EVERYBODY", "category": "Ethics Classification 1125.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, identify who is wrong here.

Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?", "output": "OTHER", "category": "Ethics Classification 1125.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, identify who is wrong here.

TL:DR at the bottom.\n\nAnyway, in January my ling distance gf came over to live with my family and I. I was living in the garage which went from manly man-cave to a cozy room fit for a mature couple. Things were great. Now, I am not a clean freak but i do hate seeing things on the floor and clutter on counters and tables. (I know that's what they are for but i like to keep flat space clear for when i wanna place temporary bigger items on them like amazon packages and what not) I started to notice a lot more mess after a while which i thought was normal since there was now mess coming from two sources instead of one so i was okay with it. Eventually the landlord tells us she wants to remodel the garage so that it is even more livable (only had one window which didn't open, and wants to add an ac) so we moved back into the main house. One thing led to another and now we have an RV for free. An RV is in no way as spacious as a garage so now her clutter which has overwhelmed my small amount of clutter is very intense. Makeup everywhere, fast food trash, and dishes like cups and plates. We both work a lot so there's never a lot of time to tackle the mess. Now the asshole part is that the other day i lashed out at her. It started as a joke that spiraled into a, \"most of the trash in here is because of you\" type of comment and that really upset her. I feel bad but at the same time, i care about the state of our temp home. So am i the asshole for being mad about it and lashing out that way? \n\nTL:DR\nGf and i live in a messy home due to how much trash and clutter she can produce.

I grew up in the States, first of my family on one side to be born here, my house while I was a child was the landing point for dozens of immigrating family. Upon finding out I was pregnant, Baby's Father (white American. I love him, he is fantastic) and I didn't know anything else, but decided I would be nanay (mommy-equivalent), and he would be daddy. Easy enough, right? \n\nThe actual problem:\nWell, turns out Baby's Father comes from an anti-immigration, staunchly monolingual home (this is AMERICA we talk ENGLISH). They both refused to say \"nanay\" because it's \"too hard\" (NAHN-eye. not hard.) when what they mean is \"too not-white\" and \"they can't remember\" they've had 3 years now. The Grandmother especially insists on calling me mommy, goes out of her way to do it, and follows up with and eye-rolling \"ohhh I forgoooot\" when I call her out. It's microaggression and passive-aggressive behavior, obviously not forgetfulness.\n\nThese people also love to post and say their opinions about immigrants, stating that immigrants and children of immigrants should be deported citing random made-up numbers and pseudo-statistics to back up their claims. When I've called them out on it, \"oh we didn't mean YOUUuuuuu\". \n\nI've taught the miniature creature how to count in multiple languages, he's barely 3 and has at least 1-10 in English, Tagalog, Spanish, and German. They both came around about multiple languages when they learned German was being introduced and very strongly encourage German (especially the grandfather), while giving me the \"this is AMERICA\" speech about Tagalog and Spanish. It's clearly racism, I have examples for days. I decided they are not allowed to be close enough to him to speak to him. They only get a visual of him if there is supervision, and under NO circumstances are they allowed to talk or touch (no head pats, no hugs), and they are especially not be left alone with Baby because I will not introduce my child to the normalization of hypocrisy or bigotry.\n\nThe problem is, though, it's putting a strain on Baby's Father. When there's a family gathering or a birthday, it makes the situation extremely stressful for all of us, but I'm the one who made the decision. He didn't have much room for a say in it, but did agree that his family is toxic to a toddler (note, I would *nev.er* say he can't see or be with his family, just that I would be staying home with Baby when he does). I know I'm not the asshole for seeing this behavior and calling it out, or even not wanting to be around it myself. But, am I the asshole for completely cutting off contact like that, and putting that kind of stress on Baby's Father? ", "output": "EVERYBODY", "category": "Ethics Classification 1125.json"}]
