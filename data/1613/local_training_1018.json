However, it does not have the same high capacity that the manufacturer's (HP) 8-cell version has.  It is comparable to the OEM 6-cell battery.<br /><br />I immediately returned it when I realized this.  The seller was very prompt in responding and took the return with very little hassle.<br /><br />Please compare mAw/WH among batteries before purchasing!  My original battery for my TX1020 has a stated capacity of 7365 mAH or 55Wh.  The HP extended battery is 73Wh.  The \\\\\"extended\\\\\" battery on this page is only 8800 mAh!  That's only a life extension of 635mah for having 33% more cells.  Huh?<br /><br />After returning this I found a much better third party battery that had capacity (and construction!) more in line with the OEM extended version for about $45(US).  The OEM version is built so that the cells are staggered and hang down below the unit, so that on a flat surface it is propped up for better ventilation than the 6-cell or \\\\\"8-cell\\\\\" on this page.<br /><br />I recommend a battery with at least a capacity of 10,000 mAh instead of this battery.<br /><br />In response to another review here, all of these batteries must be fully charged and discharged completely one full time before they are properly calibrated.

I like the click and clack noises but I have a friend with the o rings and I really liked them, so I decided to buy them. It took a really long time to do all the keys, but man is it worth it. I'm getting used to the lack of a clack noise, but because they're MX blues, the keys themselves are still very tactile and clicky, I'm not really missing out on anything. It doesn't make the keys mushy or bad in any way. I'm really glad I got the red o rings because I swear the distance difference is actually pretty noticeable, I wouldn't get the blue o-rings unless you want super short key travel.<br /><br />Note if you have a Razer BlackWidow (mine's a pre 2013 model), the +, enter, and 0 key on the numberpad have stabilizer bars that are facing the wrong way so they're damn near impossible to remove or put back. They unclip on the edge of the keyboard instead of toward the inside of the keyboard. I didn't bother with those keys since I really don't care about the number pad, although it's kind of irritating knowing that I couldn't get every single key. If you're super OCD just a forewarning.<br /><br />Also, it takes a while to put these suckers on. Make sure you have a good key puller, I recommend WASD's key puller, although this is entirely up to your preference. Also, I wouldn't bother trying to put the o rings on with your fingers, even if you're really nimble. I took a pen and unscrewed the top and it fit perfectly to push on all the o rings. It took a while but if I tried to do it any other way I imagine it would've taken forever.<br /><br />Even though the price is a little steep, as everyone else is saying, it's worth it. If you're even here looking at o rings for your mechanical keyboard, you know what you're doing and you know exactly what you want. Go for it.<br /><br />EDIT after a few months of use:<br /><br />So, today I was cleaning my mechanical keyboard and decided to take off the O-rings. I just bought another keyboard with ALPS switches that are very, very clicky and I wanted to go back to the original feel of regular MX blue switches while the ALPS keyboard is shipping. That isn't to say I entirely disliked the O-rings. I can see how they're awesome if you have a linear switch and you want to shorten your key travel distance. For that--they're perfect; and if you want a switch to be less noisy if you're in an office environment they would be great as well. However, over time, I missed the clack of the MX Blues. It's weirdly soothing.<br /><br />I'm not saying anything bad about the product, as they did their job perfectly. I tried them and simply discovered I did miss the bottoming out noise, so I went back to normal. If you know for a fact you like your keyboards to be noisy, you will probably enjoy the difference this product makes for a while, just for the sake of change, then you might go back to wonderfully noisy switches. Just know what you're buying and really consider whether or not this would be right for you.st bought another keyboard with ALPS switches that are very, very clicky and I wanted to go back to the original feel of regular MX blue switches while the ALPS keyboard is shipping.

But with the technological advances of the last few decades, it really is all about the operating system. And I have so had it with Microsoft. I've been clinging to XP, eschewing the poorly written Vista, and dreading MS's threatened loss of support for XP. But what I finally tired of is the constant parade of digital hobgoblins that haunt the OS of every PC - viruses, malware, resident update monitors, anti-virus software, etc. All of these things erode and destroy the operating performance of a PC.<br /><br />I purchased this low-end Mac mini because it had the same processor as my PC - and it was cheap. I bought 4GB of Crucial memory, watched the video on YouTube, and effortlessly upgraded the memory to 4GB in about 15 minutes. It was not the easiest upgrade I have made - and I definitely do not recommend it to the novice. But I have been building my own PCs for years now. Incidentally, in upgrading my memory, I also allowed my nVidia graphics memory to bump up to 256MB - nice!<br /><br />What first amazed me was how QUICKLY the Mac booted up, since my PC takes FOREVER to load all the crap that is necessary to work with the flawed Windows OS. The second thing that amazed me was how much FASTER this computer was than my old PC, despite it having the same CPU and memory (I should add that I routinely did hard drive and registry cleanups on my PC, so that was not why it was running so slowly). The third thing that amazed me was how intuitive and simple the Mac OS X GUI was to work with.<br /><br />My only regret is that I did not upgrade the hard drive at the same time. However, I have a 1TB USB external that works with Time Machine (what a great background backup program!) and another 1TB Firewire800 external I use for data storage, so there is little pressure on the standard 120GB 5400rpm drive. However, I imagine I will - at some point - swap it out for at least a 500GB 7200rpm drive, which should boost performance even more.<br /><br />If you are using this to switch from a PC, keep your old mouse or trackball, but definitely get the new Mac keyboard.

It does not keep tablet inside ,when you put the tablet on the kick stand it slides out of the case which makes it hard to access the controls located on bottom of tablet.The case doesn't allow the tablet to breathe therefore after about 15 min use the tablet cuts off because it has gotten hot. The case protects the tablet when you travel but you have to take tablet out of case to use it which becomes a hassle. I've had the case for about 1 month and will be looking for a better case. Also the frame of the case that goes around the front of tablet is very flimsy and can not be leather. In fact it looks and feels like cardboard and can rip very easily if you are not careful. I feel that I have been duped when I brought this case and I really don't think it's worth the money.Especially based on the other cases I have seen.

Amazon shipping was prompt as always.  The Card arrived in its original Asus packaging.  The first thing that i noticed was that the package seemed to be sealed differently with a long tape instead of shrink wrap or circular seal.  Another suspicious thing that was noticed was that there was a sticker over the UPC number.  But the card seemed to be as described from its looks.  I went ahead and installed it in the system and the first thing that was noticed was that the card does not install on the motherboard since the CPU fan was hitting against the BIOS battery.  I then went ahead and reviewed the diagrams on the card and it looked like the heatsink was mounted incorrectly, so went ahead and remounted the heat sink turning it around 180 degrees and now it fits properly on the motherboard.  Further all installations went smoothly and the system properly booted up.<br />So my thoughts at that point was that this was a quality control issue with ASUS.  After installing Windows 8.1 everything seemed to be working fine.  I then went ahead and installed the driver from ASUS and it seemed to go smoothly.  The system asked for a reboot and now windows started complaining that the driver for the video card is outdated and wanted to update it, and this is when i noticed that the card detected was a 6670 instead of 7250 which is one generation older.<br />I then went to AMD site and downloaded the driver and even that was detecting the card as a 6670 instead of 7250.  I decided to get more in-depth into this and started reviewing the card in detail and that is when i noticed that the card i received had a different mounting plate than what was given in the ASUS site and video outputs were all in the wrong places.<br />Called up Amazon and they agreed to send a replacement by next day air.  So hoping that the replacement card that i get will not be a fake one again.", "output": "Negative Review", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 463.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an Amazon review, indicate whether it is a 'Positive Review' or 'Negative Review'.", "input": "Ordered this tablet about a week ago once I received it I was disappointed b/c its not the same color as shown in the picture", "output": "Negative Review", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 463.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an Amazon review, indicate whether it is a 'Positive Review' or 'Negative Review'.", "input": "This thing is horrible for the macbook air.

The only good thing about this case is that the bottom half has openings to allow for ventilation (the Speck* case does not).  Even though the MacAir vents at the rear, near the hinge, this still seems like a good idea. However, my recommendation would be to spend the money on a more high-quality case that won't be too heavy and will be more easy to remove.

This latest model of the Corsair Hydro H60 is remarkable!  I had the original version and it lasted me 5 years working smoothy to keep my CPU cool, always in 30C's idle and loaded at 45 to 48C's.  This new one is so much quieter and is keeping the temperatures in the 30C's ad idle and in the 40C's fully loaded as well. So what's the difference between old and new Hydro H60?  I can run the fan on Turbo setting which is quieter than the older Standard speed (I like quiet).  Plus - a big plus. The bracket for AM sockets, in my case AM3 and AM3+ is so easy to install compared to the older model.  All you need do is put the bracket over the top of the Cooler and a magnetic attachment holds it in place while you tighten the fasteners by hand until the cooler is snug on the processor. Nothing more to do for us AMD enthusiasts.  The AM sockets have the two catches for the regular fans to fit over then tighten up.  The same catches are all you need for the Hydro H60 bracket for snugging up the cooler to the processor.  Outstanding Corsair!!  I have Corsair Looped Cooling in two rigs and Corsair Memory and Corsair PSU.  Yep, big fan of Corsair.  Kudos for upgrading the H60 to take on moderate to extreme overclocking with the Athlon, Phenom and FX series processors. Other upgrades to the H60.

It'll tell the internet is connected when it's not. Even more annoying is that when the internet is actually connecting to our wireless devices and laptops, it will constantly tell me it's not and that the wireless is down.  Also it doesn't really assist you in anyway to figure out the problems of it constantly disconnecting.<br /><br />This whole product is garbage and every forum online of people having the same issues I'm having are told that basic functions of the router may be causing the disconnect.  Apparently turning off your security system will help keep it connected.

It seems to me the DX and possibly the K2 are still just a bit \\\\\"too new\\\\\" and untested to invest this amount of money.  I love the concept and it seems the Kindle is a reasonably nice product.  However, things I have picked up from the reviews which tell me to wait for a year or two are:    1.  Price.  This is still a bit too expensive to feel comfortable that I am getting my money's worth.  Amazon should do what the ink-jet printer folks did which is give you the printer for almost nothing and you pay big on the refills -- give the Kindle away for almost nothing and make the money on the downloads.  This will get millions of Kindles out on the market creating a lot more demand for content.    2.  It appears the DX (and maybe the K2?) screen will likely break or get scratched even under fairly normal use - really bad design by Amazon and the current policy is to charge you $350 to get it fixed.    2. The other big issue is the battery.  If I understand correctly, you cannot buy a replacement battery, you have to turn your Kindle in for over $100 or more to have them ship you a new Kindle (so why can't they ship you a new Kindle if you screen breaks for the same price?)  This means that about every two years (average time for batteries to work for a long period of time) you are paying over $100 to keep your kindle working.    3. If you upgrade to the next Kindle, you have a good chance of losing books you previously bought that Amazon claims is \\\\\"safe forever\\\\\".    4. Amazon seems to believe they are the morality police and will delete whatever they feel is inappropriate on your Kindle - really bad policy.    5. I think having some kind of built-in led light would be useful to make it readable at night or while in a car or similar.  This would be a small drain on the battery, but very useful.    I think this space needs a really strong competitor to motivate Amazon to \\\\\"do this right\\\\\".

Okay, I've had this machine for a week now.  I will probably update this after more time has passed.  I also like the small keyboard because there's less hand and finger travel involved so I find it much easier to type.      THE BATTERY is UNREAL.  READ your manuals boys and girls, ESPECIALLY the part about conditioning your battery three times.  Search the internet and download the free program \\\\\"CPUID Hardware Monitor\\\\\".  It shows the \\\\\"wear level\\\\\" and capacity of your battery.  VERY cool.  My battery started with 10% wear level out of the box.  After 3 \\\\\"conditionings\\\\\" as explained in the manual, I have zero wear level and today my power meter says I have 11 hours and 48 minutes to go!  Each \\\\\"conditioning\\\\\" I did, I watched the battery's capacity level in CPUID go up!  I have NEVER seen ANYTHING like this in my life and I have had multiple laptops since 1995.  The battery life is CRAZY.  Obviously those numbers will go down faster as you start and run programs.      I wish they could put decent graphic cards in these netbooks.  NONE of them in this price range on the market have one.  But then that would also kill the battery life as well.  This one will get you by with BASIC graphics handling.  I can watch HD video MP4s only with Quicktime.  VLC Media Player and Windows Media Player (after installing codecs for it) jitter and stutter with HD MP4 videos, Quicktime does NOT.  I have run several BASIC games, Hoyle Casino 2008, MS Pinball Arcade, Virtual Pool 3 and they all seem to run good, no issues.  As you have no T&L or anti-aliasing capabilities with this video card, the heavy duty 3D games stutter and jitter if they run AT ALL.  After a couple days I upgraded the RAM to 2 GB to see if that would help and it did not.  Basic, low graphic games run just fine.  What's funny is I watched HD video on YouTube with zero issues.  I run an older version of Adobe Photoshop without any issues.  Microsoft Office 2007 runs beautifully.    UPDATE: HD VIDEO EDITING  My Sanyo VPC CG10 HD digital camcorder creates videos in HD MP4 format.  I had to do a few things to get this computer to work with them.  I had to install the codecs from shark007.net to get the PC to work with the MP4s. After that, they will play in Windows Media Player as well.  HD editing? I bought the \\\\\"Wondershare\\\\\" Netbook converter suite which includes their \\\\\"DVD to netbook converter\\\\\" and a pretty quick and efficient \\\\\"Video to netbook\\\\\" converter. They have a trial and that's what made me buy it. It's simple, fast, efficient, has many options and takes up very little space on my hard drive. Google them. After trying several other converters, I found this to be the best for me. I convert the videos from MP4 to WMV and load them into the old XP Windows Movie Maker. I found out that XP Windows Movie Maker uses profiles. The default settings don't allow you to save your creations in HD format. HOWEVER, I found dozens of *.prx files, which are the profiles, all over the web. I downloaded several HD profiles. Some included instructions on which folder to copy them to. WALLA! Like magic... I am now editing and saving HD videos with this netbook using Windows XP SP3 and the old XP Windows Movie Maker on a 1.66 Ghz processor, 2 gigs of RAM! No stuttering, no issues, zero problems and the videos come out great!    UPDATE: SEE COMMENTS BELOW ON MY RAM MEMORY EXPERIENCE!    Overall speed.  This thing flies!!!  Clicking on things, opening programs, Windows start up... zooming in a map in Delorme or Microsoft mapping software... ALL wayyyyyyy faster than my 2.2 Ghz Dual Core, 4 GB RAM Windows 7 Professional laptop.  How does THAT happen???  Everything just seems to happen FASTER.  Is it Windows XP?  I don't know but I did WANT a netbook with Windows XP.  I wanted one before you can't buy them any longer.  As it is now, you can't buy them in stores any longer.    Overall, for $300, I LOVE this little machine and have decided I will keep it.  I'll save the HD video editing for my other laptop.  Although, I have not tried it yet on this little machine.  Maybe in a review update.  It's more than half the size as my other laptop and even with a case, can EASILY fit in an airplane carry-on or under a car seat.  I fit MOST of the programs and files I need on the 160 GB hard drive.  Too bad Windows XP does not support any larger sizes.  I anticipate this little machine will be going with me everywhere I go... never leave the house without it!    I give it 5 stars out of 5!!!  It's a keeper!!!

By February 2013, the battery held no charge and started to swell (just as the original had after 4 years of use.) Again, I would not buy this again knowing what I know now.<br /><br />Update for Dec 13, 2012: The battery turned out to be a piece of junk.  It started to go downhill after 2 months, and now only holds a 15 minute charge with no warning that it is low.  The computer just turns off.  I would recommend against purchasing this battery, even at a cheap price.<br /><br />[previous review]<br />First of all, the finish doesn't match the actual MacBook, as the black MacBook is matte, and the battery is shiny.  That's not a problem, since I have a leather cover for my computer.  I \\\\\"trained\\\\\" the battery for over 2 weeks, completely emptying it each time, and it still doesn't keep very accurate time. Again I can make do, but it's something to be aware of.  When it gets to about 20 minutes to go, you better either plug in or start saving everything that you don't want to lose.<br /><br />I read a few reviews where people are claiming 4 hours on a charge.  I wasn't so lucky.  On the lowest screen brightness setting, I can probably get about 2.5 hours out of one charge.  I have had the battery for about a month now, so yeah, that's as good as it's ever going to be with this one.  My original MacBook battery wasn't much better, so at least this one is cheap.

The radio looks more like an antenna than an FM Stereo tuner. A good deal of the compact size comes from the fact that all of the amplification is located in your PC or your powered speakers. The cables need to be hooked up to a USB port, as well as either a Line-In or Mic-In connector on your sound card. I can't find fault with the hardware, but the software has been a nightmare. <br />I've installed the radio on two Windows 98 machines and a Windows 2000 Professional machine with miserable results. I was never able to get on-screen volume controls to work under Windows 98, and after several weeks all of the software quit working entirely. Under windows 2000 Pro, everything worked O.K. for a couple of months, then I started getting an error message on start up that said that a number must be between 1 and (about 2 billion). All of the station names disappeared, and the volume controls in the D-Link software stopped working. Upgrading to new drivers resulted in the software being unable to locate the radio, even though Windows said that it was there and working correctly. Uninstalling the software still resulted in Windows trying to start it on boot up. Reinstalling the software was unsuccessful, as I kept receiving the 'unable to locate radio' message. <br />So, now I'm left with a [dollar amount] paperweight.

I rma'd the monitor, shipped it back. they claimed they did a repair on it and shipped it back. I open the box to find the same issue. I swear all they did was wait a week, put it back in another box and shipped it back. I did another rma, shipped it to them, they claimed they did a repair and sent it back, same issue.
