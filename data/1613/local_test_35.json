The wonders of nature are endless . Sometimes , we can recognize ourselves in animals , and one of the moments that we can understand and sympathize with is when an animal faces something new and must rise to an unusual challenge . That 's our story now . It 's called \" The Coyote Who Was n't , \" and , as you can guess , it 's about a coyote who was n't quite a coyote . Or maybe we should say , about _ one _ who was more than a coyote . Now , you know , the coyote is a very clever animal . And , generally speaking , people tend to underestimate him . That 's because they do n't really know him . The fact that he 's still around , when a lot of other creatures have become extinct , speaks for his ability to adapt to new situations and to get along with man . In some ways , he 's very much like his cousin , the dog : he 's smart , he has ability to learn and , when treated with kindness , he can show a certain kind of loyalty . Now , if you were to put a coyote with sheep , generally , you could expect trouble . But when an old Navajo Indian tried it , well , let 's see what happened .", "output": "coyote", "category": "Coreference Resolution 1029.json"}]
