The Boxing Day Tsunami of December 26, 2004 was by far the deadliest of all time (Figure 1.1). The tsunami was caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake. With a magnitude of 9.2, it was the second largest earthquake ever recorded. The extreme movement of the crust displaced trillions of tons of water along the entire length of the rupture. Several tsunami waves were created with about 30 minutes between the peaks of each one. The waves that struck nearby Sumatra 15 minutes after the quake reached more than 10 meters (33 feet) in height. The size of the waves decreased with distance from the earthquake and were about 4 meters (13 feet) high in Somalia. The tsunami did so much damage because it traveled throughout the Indian Ocean. About 230,000 people died in eight countries. There were fatalities even as far away as South Africa, nearly 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) from the earthquake epicenter. More than 1.2 million people lost their homes and many more lost their ways of making a living. The countries that were most affected by the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami.

People didnt have time to recover before massive tsunami waves hit the island nation. As seen in Figure 1.2, waves in some regions topped 9 meters (27 feet). The tsunami did much more damage than the massive earthquake (Figure 1.3). Worst was the damage done to nuclear power plants along the northeastern coast. Eleven reactors were automatically shut down. Power and backup power were lost at the Fukushima plant, leading to equipment failures, meltdowns, and the release of radioactive materials. Control and cleanup of the disabled plants will go on for many years. As a result of the 2004 tsunami, an Indian Ocean warning system was put into operation in June 2006. Prior to 2004, no one had thought a large tsunami was possible in the Indian Ocean. In comparison, a warning system has been in effect around the Pacific Ocean for more than 50 years. The system was used to warn of possible tsunami waves after the Tohoku earthquake, but most were too close to the quake to get to high ground in time.

We show that menin is a transcriptional coactivator of the nuclear receptors for estrogen and vitamin D. Activation of the endogenous estrogen-responsive TFF1 (pS2) gene results in promoter recruitment of menin and in elevated trimethylation of H3K4. Knockdown of menin reduces both activated TFF1 (pS2) transcription and H3K4 trimethylation. In addition, menin can directly interact with the estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) in a hormone-dependent manner. The majority of disease-related MEN1 mutations prevent menin-ERalpha interaction.

Photosynthetic bacteria use the energy of the sun to make their own food. In the presence of sunlight, carbon dioxide and water are turned into glucose and oxygen. The glucose is then turned into usable energy. Glucose is like the \"food\" for the bacteria. An example of photosynthetic bacteria is cyanobacteria, as seen in the opening image. These bacteria are sometimes called blue-green algae, although they are not algae, due to their numerous chlorophyll molecules. Bacteria known as decomposers break down wastes and dead organisms into smaller molecules. These bacteria use the organic substrates they break down to get their energy, carbon, and nutrients they need for survival. Bacteria can also be chemotrophs. Chemosynthetic bacteria, or chemotrophs, obtain energy by breaking down chemical compounds in their environment. An example of one of these chemicals broken down by bacteria is nitrogen-containing ammonia. These bacteria are important because they help cycle nitrogen through the environ- ment for other living things to use. Nitrogen cannot be made by living organisms, so it must be continually recycled. Organisms need nitrogen to make organic compounds, such as DNA. Some bacteria depend on other organisms for survival. For example, some bacteria live in the roots of legumes, such as pea plants ( Figure 1.1). The bacteria turn nitrogen-containing molecules into nitrogen that the plant can use. Meanwhile, the root provides nutrients to the bacteria. In this relationship, both the bacteria and the plant benefit, so it is known as a mutualism. Other mutualistic bacteria include gut microbes. These are bacteria that live in the intestines of animals. They are usually beneficial bacteria, needed by the host organism. These microbes obviously dont kill their host, as that would kill the bacteria as well. Other bacteria are parasitic and can cause illness.

Groups such as religious centers or schools hold bake sales. They sell cakes, cookies and other baked goods to raise money. In America, you can always find a good sale, no matter the day or time of year. There is the Independence Day sale, Veteran's Day sale, clearance sale, sidewalk sale, red tag sale, white sale, blue light special, liquidation sale, half-off sale, warehouse sale, tent sale ...", "output": "What do we call the sale if it starts before the sun rises?", "category": "Question Generation 1097.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage.", "input": "At 60, rue des Archives, this Hotel de Guenegaud was built between 1651 and 1655 for Jean-Francois de Guenegaud des Brosses, secretaire du Roi, maitre des Comptes and conseiller d'Etat, by Francois Mansart (the only hotel particulier this architect built to have fully survived).", "output": "Who was behind the creation of H\u00f4tel de Gu\u00e9n\u00e9gaud?", "category": "Question Generation 1097.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage.", "input": "Toni Young (born January 11, 1991) is an American professional basketball player who last played for the New York Liberty of the WNBA.", "output": "What team did Toni Young play for?", "category": "Question Generation 1097.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage.", "input": "The development of the Type 62 light tank began at Factory 674 (Harbin First Machinery Building Group Ltd) in 1958.", "output": "Which company manufactured Type 62?", "category": "Question Generation 1097.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage.", "input": "Sedimentary rocks follow certain rules. 1. Sedimentary rocks are formed with the oldest layers on the bottom and the youngest on top. 2. Sediments are deposited horizontally, so sedimentary rock layers are originally horizontal, as are some vol- canic rocks, such as ash falls. 3. Sedimentary rock layers that are not horizontal are deformed. Since sedimentary rocks follow these rules, they are useful for seeing the effects of stress on rocks. Sedimentary rocks that are not horizontal must have been deformed. You can trace the deformation a rock has experienced by seeing how it differs from its original horizontal, oldest- on-bottom position. This deformation produces geologic structures such as folds, joints, and faults that are caused by stresses. Youre standing in the Grand Canyon and you see rocks like those in the Figure 1.1. Using the rules listed above, try to figure out the geologic history of the geologic column. The Grand Canyon is full mostly of sedimentary rocks, which are important for deciphering the geologic history of a region. In the Grand Canyon, the rock layers are exposed like a layer cake. Each layer is made of sediments that were deposited in a particular environment - perhaps a lake bed, shallow offshore region, or a sand dune. (a) The rocks of the Grand Canyon are like a layer cake. (b) A geologic column showing the rocks of the Grand Canyon. In this geologic column of the Grand Canyon, the sedimentary rocks of groups 3 through 6 are still horizontal. Group 2 rocks have been tilted. Group 1 rocks are not sedimentary. The oldest layers are on the bottom and youngest are on the top. The ways geologists figure out the geological history of an area will be explored more in the chapter Earth History. Click image to the left or use the URL below.
