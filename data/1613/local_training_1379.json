Countless innocent children and spouses have been shot by family members fearful of those entering occupied dwellings. I stand by my comment: I hate burglars with a purple passion: they are in the same category as rapists as they strip people of their sense of security: they violate us in many ways.

That being said, If someone shoots and kills a burglar in the act, I congratulate them and celebrate the grand occasion.", "output": "Yes", "category": "Toxic Language Detection 789.json"}, {"instruction": "Categorize the comment on the basis of threat.
