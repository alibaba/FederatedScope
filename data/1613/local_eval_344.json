Uhhh no it's not just white people its every other non black race and they're not trying to bash this protest. But why can't it just be about police brutality and racism in general. Black people and white people get hated on all the time and that goes the same for Asians and Hispanics. The all lives matter thing is saying police brutality needs to end and so does racism. And do you really think black people aren't racist against white people. I just saw a video of a group of black people beating the sh!t out of white people and setting their cars on fire.
