Basically fading techniques to gradually take away your babies sources of comfort until they comply. The second part is for those naughty babies who actually need more help getting to sleep. For that she recommends the extinction method, softened up by a new name and some witty jokes. The author seems like a very selfish person. She recommends sleep training at 2 months old.
