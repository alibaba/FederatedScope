[{"instruction": "In this task, you are given a paragraph (from a research paper) and your task is to classify each sentence of the paragraph (assume n sentence) into the following categories: Background, Purpose, Method, Finding/Contribution, or Other. Return the output in this format: 1 - category of sentence 1, 2 - category of sentence 2, ..., n - category of sentence n; where each number indicates the order of the sentence. The categories can be identified using the following questions: \n Background: - Why is this problem important? - What relevant works have been done before? - What did the previous works miss? - What are the high-level research questions? - How might this help other researchers?\n Purpose: - What specific things do the researchers want to do? - What specific knowledge do the researchers want to know? - What specific hypothesis do the researchers want to test?\n Method: - How did the researchers do it or find it out? - What are the procedures and steps of this research?\n Finding/Contribution: - What did the researchers find out? Did the proposed methods work? - Did things behave as the researchers expected?\nOther: put every text fragment that does not fit into any of the categories above here.

Those with the greatest trust in the government were the most likely to be vaccinated (43.4%), and those least confident were the least willing (15.8%). From the ones reporting being confident in the local health system, 38.4% were willing to be vaccinated, and from those not confident, only 23.5% were willing to be vaccinated. Conclusion: The decision to get vaccinated in the midst of a contagious outbreak involves many considerations. Trust in the government's technical and organization skill to deal with the infectious outbreak along with trust in medical organizations predict the adoption of recommended protection measures. The results indicate that public compliance with vaccination plans in health crisis requires the development of social and institutional trust.", "output": "1 - finding, 2 - finding, 3 - finding, 4 - finding, 5 - finding, 6 - finding, 7 - finding, 8 - finding, 9 - finding, 10 - finding", "category": "Section Classification 980.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a paragraph (from a research paper) and your task is to classify each sentence of the paragraph (assume n sentence) into the following categories: Background, Purpose, Method, Finding/Contribution, or Other.

The aim of this study was to map research productivity on the disease based on the articles indexed in PubMed. The articles related to MERS dated from 2012 to 2015 were retrieved from PubMed. The articles were classified into three categories according to their focus. Publication outputs were assessed and frequently used terms were mapped using the VOS viewer software. A total of 443 articles were included for analysis. They were published in 162 journals, with Journal of Virology being the most productive (44 articles; 9.9%) and by six types of organizations, with universities being the most productive (276 articles; 62.4%).The largest proportion of the articles focused on basic medical sciences and clinical studies (47.2%) and those on prevention and control ranked third (26.2%), with those on other focuses coming in between (26.6%). The articles on prevention and control had the highest mean rank for impact factor (IF) (226.34), followed by those on basic medical sciences and clinical studies (180.23) and those on other focuses (168.03). The mean rank differences were statistically significant (p = 0.000). Besides, \"conronavirus\", \"case\", \"transmission\" and \"detection\" were found to be the most frequently used terms. The findings of this first bibliometric study on MERS suggest that the prevention and control of the disease has become a big concern and related research should be strengthened.", "output": "1 - background, 2 - background, 3 - background, 4 - background, 5 - purpose, 6 - method, 7 - method, 8 - method, 9 - method, 10 - method, 11 - method, 12 - method, 13 - method, 14 - method, 15 - finding, 16 - finding, 17 - finding, 18 - finding, 19 - finding, 20 - finding", "category": "Section Classification 980.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a paragraph (from a research paper) and your task is to classify each sentence of the paragraph (assume n sentence) into the following categories: Background, Purpose, Method, Finding/Contribution, or Other.

The particles banded at a density of 1.21 g/ml after cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation. To determine whether the presence of this virus might be related to clinical symptoms, several patient groups were studied prospectively. In 8 of 16 (50%) homosexual males with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or unexplained lymphadenopathy syndrome (LAS), coronavirus particles were found. In contrast, such particles were found in none of 18 heterosexual controls and in only 3 of 20 homosexual males without AIDS or LAS. Thus, coronavirus excretion correlated significantly (2c~<0.01) with the clinical diagnosis of AIDS or with syndromes belonging to the AIDS-related complex. In addition, such particles identified in the serum of one patient with LAS and diarrhea suggest invasion and systemic spread of the agent and underline that this virus behaves differently from\" common cold\" human coronaviruses.", "output": "1 - background, 2 - background, 3 - purpose, 4 - method, 5 - finding, 6 - finding, 7 - finding, 8 - finding", "category": "Section Classification 980.json"}]
