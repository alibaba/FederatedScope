By consequence, he makes a lot of money but is often working 60+ hours a week.  \nMy mom has taken this as an opportunity to stay home. She hasn't worked in years, doing about 2-3 hours of volunteer work a week.  \nI'm a student in my junior year of high school taking advanced classes. Between school and homework, it's about 50 hours a week, plus about 10 hours of extracurriculars. As a result, I value my vacation time enormously, as it is the rare opportunity to relax.  \nWe are comfortably upper-middle-class to rich. We could afford a house cleaner easily. However, my mom says that's elitist and every family should be able to clean their own house.  \nI think that, because she is home the vast majority of the time, I am nearly independent, and she made the choice not to hire a house cleaner, she should do all the housework. She argues that since I live in the house, I should do my equal share. When I help, she acts like it was my responsibility. I believe she should see this as a favor from me.  \nI am on vacation this week, and so she expects me to do a significant amount of chores (about 5 hours' worth over the next two days) while she rests. I understand she does the housework normally and deserves a vacation also, but I think that's her job and if she doesn't like it, she should get my dad to pay me or a house cleaning service. If nothing else, I think she should be far more grateful than she's been. However, I've been told that housework is far more exhausting than a kid could understand. So, AITA for thinking this way?  \nTLDR: SAHM is the only one who's home often and she says house cleaning services are elitist. She expects me to do part of the housework.

Obviously since I was very drunk, I don't remember too much detail from the night itself. But I was worried I was **dangerously** drunk (it's happened before), so I called my mom to see if she thought I needed to go to the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe asked if any of my roommates were home (one was), and to see if they were awake and what they thought. So I knocked on my roommate's door (IDK if he was asleep or not, can't remember), and he took the phone and started talking to my mom, reassuring her \"It's ok, I'm going to take care of him and make sure nothing happens, etc.\" (He's a very nice guy, sincerely.) I think he put on a movie or something and just sorta made sure I didn't choke on vomit or stop breathing or something. (Again, I don't really remember.) We had only been roommates for about a month, so we weren't childhood besties or anything, but we had gotten along swimmingly during that time and really clicked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next morning, I woke up massively hungover and vaguely remember what happened the night before. I was late to work, but before I left I wrote him a thank you note, telling him how much I appreciate what he did, that I've been struggling really badly with alcoholism for the past 2-3 years (I'm 25, he's 29) but I'm doing a lot to get better and trying really hard to stay sober, and that I'd like to take him out to dinner or buy him an xbox game or something to repay him. I slid the note under his door and went to work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was the last we ever interacted really. He hasn't said a word to me or looked me in the eye in MONTHS. We used to hang out all the time. Now, whenever he is home, he always has his headphones on, cooks dinner and takes it into his room to eat, he moved the tv from the common area into his room so he can watch it in there (we bonded when we first met over liking the same movies and shows, and watched a lot office together.) I always say \"hey\" or \"What's up\" when I see him, he never responds (literally no response.) I try occasionally to make conversation, it never happens. I asked if he wanted to watch a movie, he just shook his head. The whole time I'm just thinking \"...Damn...\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI asked him point-blank if I did anything to upset him after a few weeks of this. He said \"No.\" and went back to what he was doing. He's European so maybe it's partly a culture thing? He's a really nice guy; I know this because we were good friends when I first moved in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's never cool to get so drunk that you need someone to make sure you don't need hospitalization; I feel bad that I put him through that. **FULL DISCLOSURE**: As I mentioned, I've been struggling with alcoholism, along with depression, pretty badly. My dad and my brother are alcoholics (I'm told there's a family gene that makes it worse?). I was at my worst senior year of college; I had to be hospitalized four separate times after drinking too much, always by myself. The final time I was hospitalized, I was found passed out on a public sidewalk at 4pm on a Monday, woke up in the ER and was told I blew a 0.4 BAC. I went to rehab for alcohol a month later, and was sober for a few months, but I relapsed on the night of this story when I went on a date that I thought went really well but was then told she didn't really like me (or something like that). I had a moment of weakness/insecurity/shame and went to a local bar to avoid feeling my emotions. The night unfolded as you might imagine and I ended up getting drunk enough to worry seriously that I needed to go to the hospital again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther than this one area of my life, which I'll admit has negatively affected many people around me the past few years (namely parents, ex-gf, and college roommates) and nearly killed me on several occasions, I try to be a really considerate person. I care \\*a lot\\* about making sure I'm treating people with kindness and consideration and respect, and that they feel comfortable around me. My past girlfriends have all told me what they really liked about me is how sweet and kind they think I am. And this roommate is also a very kind and good person. But I can tell he just fucking hates me. I'm moving out in a few months, and he's been living here for much longer than I have, so I'm just gonna bite the bullet and respect that and try to spend as much time out of the house as possible so that he doesn't have to feel uncomfortable in his own home (which he clearly is when I'm around.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDude fuckin hates me, hates when I'm around, and wants nothing to do with me and makes that clear.

Maybe three weeks overall.\n\nAt some point, however, it slipped by that she's got a boyfriend. Now, within our common friend group this seems to have been common knowledge.

I'm currently a senior at a 4 year university and until recently I was living with my parents because it financially makes sense. It only takes me 30 minutes to make the drive to campus so I've been fine making the daily commute. Over winter break, a friend of mine invited me out to the bar for a few drinks. We've been friends for a good 4 years and he's also my old roommate freshman year. While we were having a good time and catching up he told me about his living situation. He told me how his parents pay for an apartment on campus but due to his grades not being so great, he had to move back home. His parents are Asian and super strict so that really didn't surprise me. After his parents forced him to move out they couldn't find anyone to sublease so they were stuck with an empty room. He then offered to let me move in for free since he can't live there. Thinking this was too good to be true I asked him if there was a catch. I was at least expecting to pay half rent or something but he said not to worry. Shocked by his generous offer I accepted. This was probably the kindest thing anyone's ever done and I was planning on doing something really nice for him over the summer. The next week I went to visit the place and met all of his roommates who were all super cool with me moving in. I then spent the next week packing and moving all my stuff over. It's been a month now and everything couldn't have been better until my friend who offered me the room texted me asking for rent money. I was a little taken aback by this and I really didn't know how to respond. I would have never agreed to move in if I had to pay rent because I simply can't afford it. Also I'm paying for my own tuition so I can't afford rent on top of my tuition payments. I would have just moved out but I already moved everything over. My bed, furniture, and clothes are all there. Also I canceled my university parking pass and spent money getting an apartment parking so if I move out I'm out a serious chunk of money since I have to buy my university pass again. I honestly think I shouldn't pay rent because he promised me I didn't have too. I'm going to tell him that I won't pay for anything.

Again we did nothing and he did nothing, this guy seems sketchy the way he apparently needs to talk to us. So he realizes we're not there or just not gonna come answer. So on the camera I watch him walk down the sidewalk about half way towards my driveway, stop, and then look down my lawn like he's trying to see what's behind my house. Then he walks down to my driveway where the view of the camera ends. So I get up to look out the window and lo and behold he walked halfway down my driveway, backed up into my lawn and started taking pictures of the neighbor's house. My mother is afraid of this man and whatever his intentions are.\n\nSo here I lost my cool. I banged on the window and started yelling at him, telling him \"get the fuck off my lawn\" and \"who the fuck are you?\" He thought my gestures telling him to get off the lawn meant, \"come back to the door and let's talk about this.\" I had to leave for school and I'm not usually very confrontational but I had no choice except to confront him.\n\nI opened the door and the first thing he did was reach out to shake my hand. I guess he knew I was too polite to refuse that. So I shook his hand and I said, \"who the hell are you? You ring my doorbell three times, no one answers so you go down my driveway and start taking pictures of the neighbor's house?\" Still a snarky tone because A. I'm confused as hell, and B. I'm just waking up. He explains everything. He says he's power washing the neighbor's house (I can see his company truck parked in front of their house) and he was simply coming to tell me that my car in the driveway would most likely get misted. Now that I think of it, he made no mention to whether or not he was going to tell me that he'd be on my property at any point. Anyway, my mood is easily manipulated by kindness. I immediately apologized and felt like a huge ass hole. He kept explaining til I got to my car and then I told him that he has a job to do so whatever is necessary just do it.\n\nI don't think he had I'll intentions but I still think he handled it wrong.

In hindsight, I realize this was a really stupid thing to say, and I should've just let the conversation flow like normally.

She asked for my manager\u2019s number under the pretense that she was checking her schedule, but she quit without telling me because she changed her mind about having two jobs. She didn\u2019t bother to tell me and I figured it out when she wasn\u2019t there for what was supposed to be her first week.\n\nLuckily for me McDonald\u2019s isn\u2019t strict at all, so no one really cared, but in a professional setting, something like that can discredit me as a person and discredit the value of my recommendations. It shows that I blindly recommended someone who wasn\u2019t serious about the job. As usual, Cami didn\u2019t apologize and didn\u2019t see a problem in what she did. I snapped and instead of playing peace maker like usual, I told her that she can expect that I\u2019ll never recommend her anywhere else ever again if I didn\u2019t get an apology for this one.\n\nI didn\u2019t get an apology, and now I\u2019m refusing to put a recommendation for her in at Publix for that exact reason. \n\nTo me it seems clear that I\u2019m not in the wrong; I warned her that this would happen and she didn\u2019t take me seriously. But now my family (who have basically accepted her as a daughter/sister) are saying that it\u2019s stupid for me to put her entire career on the line because of a \u201ctrivial argument.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t simply that argument, it was 10 years of attitude problems. I love her and I don\u2019t want to ruin her life, but I also can\u2019t pretend like that behavior is okay. My family says I\u2019m being a petty bitch, and I\u2019m quite upset that they\u2019ve taken her side in the side in the situation.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n", "output": "OTHER", "category": "Ethics Classification 1125.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, identify who is wrong here.

I never got angry, but she could tell I was upset. That night when we went to bed she started crying saying she was sorry for ruining my birthday. I told she hadn't and explained why I was upset by her not eating. \n\nAnyway, AITA in this situation?

For some reason, most of the things we liked overlapped at some point, but she tended to be the first to get into them. \n\nLately, I've been really into Sherlock and she was really into the series as well a few months ago, but now she only talks about Queen. I also really like their music, but she's like... Obsessed, they're the only thing she talks about, besides boys she likes. \n\nIt wouldn't be much of a problem if it wasn't for how she has acted in the past.\n\nLast summer I casually ended up watching an F1 race and I absolutely fell in love! It was the best thing I'd ever watched and it quickly became my biggest passion. I did talk about it a LOT and she did anything she could to kinda bring it down. \nNo biggie, we could talk about Harry Potter, which we both liked.\n\nOne day we all decided to go out for ice-cream or something and the first thing she said was: \"Ok guys. No talking about F1, nor Harry Potter today.\" \nI looked at her a bit confused, but I thought it was kinda fair, since I did talk about those things a lot. I figured it was annoying to her and brushed it off, nodding periodically as she ranted about the guy she liked. \n\nIt was not the last time she did a thing like that, because EVERY TIME we went out after that, she'd repeat the same thing. She was also getting out of her HP phase so it was really useful for her, but it killed conversation for me.\n\nSo, after Bohemian Rhapsody came out, her love for Queen finally bloomed. I wasn't really worried, because I liked the band as well, so I figured we could talk about something that we both liked, for once.\nAs we went on, it became pretty annoying. As in it was the ONLY thing she'd talk about and since I didn't care much about the singers themselves, it was essentially just her rambling about Roger Taylor and going on and on about how cool he is and all that.\nSince I'd acted like that too, I didn't care.\n\nWe RP sometimes, so she decided to start a RP about Queen. I don't RP much these days, but okay cool, I'd just have to do a cringey self-insert where she'd be perfect and all the characters would be OOC. Whatever, I enjoyed the memes I made through it. (The RPs would be centered about her and her current love interest, making the actual plot pretty much shit.).\n\nWe'd been RPing Queen for a few weeks about every night at one point, and I felt like RPing Sherlock for once. I thought she wouldn't mind.\nShe refused, which was what made me mad. We only talked about Queen, she'd always have her way with stuff, she never let me talk about what I liked and the one time I wanna do Sherlock, she refused.\n\nAfter that I always got pissed when she spoke about Queen and, though I haven't said anything about it to her (She'd just back stab by saying I do the same thing with F1, or would get mad and say stuff like \"You're right, whatever\" and think she's right.)

A few years ago, we joined an IRL community that meets on Sundays. We're not religious but we didn't have any friends after moving from the town where we met, and we found a non-religious community that was welcoming. A TON of the people in the community are polyamorous. We'd never been exposed to that. At the time, we knew that wasn't for us - it didn't bother us, but we had too many years of thinking that serious relationships are only monogamous for us just to overcome decades of living a certain way that fast. We did talk a lot with each other about it, which led to us being more open with each other about crushes (a good thing, IMO). \n\nI struck up a friendship on Facebook with a friend of my best friend. We started off just sending memes and chatting about news and other stuff. She said we should get dinner sometime. Now's a great time for me to say that after years of being completely monogamous, I am Naive. As. Hell. I didn't read any romantic overtones into her saying that, so my response was basically \"Sure! Next time you're in town, we can hang!\" She let me know a couple months later that she was going to be in town, and asked me to dinner. I said \"Sure! Can \\[mutual friend\\], my wife, and my kid come too? We all like \\[the restaurant she wanted to go to\\]!\" She said that was totally okay. \n\nAfter the dinner, she messaged and asked if we were polyamorous, and put forward that she was attracted to me. I showed it to my wife immediately, and she helped me draft a response: \"Flirting isn't illegal, but it won't go anywhere with me, and we're really not poly.\"\n\nWell, she did take us at our word and kept flirting. I'd keep telling my wife, and she just said \"I'd rather you not flirt back, but if it makes you feel good that she's flirting, I'm okay with it.\" I told this lady as much, and for a few more months, it kept up that way. I checked in with my wife, and that's when my wife said \"Do you want to flirt back?\" I said \"I have to admit, I really like her, and the flirting is pretty fun.\" My wife gave the go-ahead, and even offered to help me flirt if I wasn't sure what to say. I was over the moon. \n\nThere's no question that I was the asshole at this point: Having zero experience flirting in over a decade, I took it over the line into outright sexting. No pics, but me and the lady I was flirting with had covered pretty much all the ground in texts. There was a point at which I realized I'd fucked up, and came clean to my wife about it on my own. She was really, really, rightfully pissed. I took what was coming, stayed in my doghouse, and worked to make it up to my wife. Wife told me that she felt partially responsible for greenlighting everything, but not staying as involved as she felt she could have, and that I shouldn't just dump my flirt. Wife said we could keep in contact, but to keep it strictly G-rated. \n\nThat lasted all of two days before the lady I was flirting with made a sexual comment about me being sensitive to one of her phobias, saying \"The fact that you care about this stuff really turns me on.\" Remembering the doghouse, I immediately blew the whistle and told my wife, and she shut everything down. I went with it, remembering my fuckups from before. Before I cut communications, I'd told the lady I was flirting with that I hoped we could stay friends, that there was a lot I thought we had in common, platonically, and that even though she made a clear mistake, I still thought we should be friends. Her response was \"you shouldn't stay friends with me.\" Normally, I'd leave it at that, but I knew that the lady I'd been flirting with had a history of depression and found the darkness a little too easily at times. I told her I wasn't going to just abandon her. \n\nThen, my wife said she was just done with all this drama, and had cut communications, and that she really wanted me to do the same. Again, remembering my fuckups, I didn't feel like I was in a position to argue, so I cut ties...but I really wonder if that was an asshole move after I'd told her everything I did about not abandoning her. So, my judges, AITA for going back on my word?  \n\n\nTL;DR - Married, monogamous dude gets permission from wife to flirt, it goes too far, wife shuts it down, flirtee crosses a line, dude basically promises flirtee not to abandon her, circumstances prevail and dude breaks promise, and now wonders if he ITA.

Why\u2019d you lie?\u201dand his response is \u201cI was embarrassed.\u201d I get it, I do, but he still lied...\n\nI then ask him what the difference between me using a dildo and him watching porn and fantasying TO the porn: \u201cthe dildo is a physical object, porn is not.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m honestly pretty pissed he\u2019s able to go ahead and say \u201cno I don\u2019t like the dildo, it\u2019s basically cheating\u201d and further discourage me from using it, to him just watching porn and masturbating? He also said that it was a \u201csubstitute\u201d for having sex with me?! But, I can\u2019t have one?! \n\nI brought that up and he said \u201cNono I never said you COULDN\u2019T use it, I said I didn\u2019t like it\u201d (oh yeah, so telling me it\u2019s basically cheating is really going to make me feel great about using the dildo).\n\nI generally wouldn\u2019t care if he watched porn IF he wouldn\u2019t put me down for using a dildo?? Is it just me, or is he a hypocrite?\n\nSorry for the long post, wanted to get as much info in here, but finally I just want to ask: Am I The Asshole here?\n\nTD;LR : my SO hated the idea of me using a dildo, told me it was \u201cbasically cheating\u201d because he\u2019s \u201cright here\u201d,  then goes on to watch porn in our bed right next to me and expects me to be a-okay with it.", "output": "EVERYBODY", "category": "Ethics Classification 1125.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, identify who is wrong here.

So about a month or 2 ago my sister broke up with her boyfriend, she has a 2 year old daughter (hes not the father but that doesn't really matter at this point) my mother has a full time 5 day a week job like most people, she is currently VERY stressed with work because she is basically in charge of a group of 50 year old children, being undermined by her boss who has recently been off sick for months, she comes home every day with a new story about how someone is refusing to do work for a very petty reason or her boss has done something to completely undermine her such as getting a new fork lift no one is trained to use then just pissing off when she asks him why he done that when he knows no one is trained on it.\n\nNow that my sister is single she leans on my mother for pretty much all the babysitting duties, she has only recently got a child minder for when she works during the week, weekends how ever she always seems to work no matter how many times my mother explains she works 5 days a week and doesn't want to essentially work 7 days a week, she isn't getting to do granny stuff with my niece, she's essentially a part time baby sitter for my sister every week and isn't getting paid for it, my mother gave my sister the VERY expensive car seat she got for herself (btw why are they so expensive anyway) so cant take her anywhere to do any fun shit, they are stuck in the house all weekend until my sister gets back from work.\n\nAt this point you may be wondering why cant my mother buy a new car seat or buggy/stroller and do some fun shit with my niece so they can both enjoy their time together, well my sister owes her over \u00a35000, recently my mother had to pay \u00a3750 to get my sisters car fixed then she ended up needing to get a new fucking car anyway. most of my sister debt to my mother comes from when she had just found out she was pregnant and decided to move into her own flat, then my sister seemed to think that as a soon to be single parent she needed EVERYTHING in the flat to be brand fucking new and of course she couldn't afford that so she convinced my mother to get most of the furniture in the place.\n\nSo basically my single parent sister is stressing my mother to the max with insisting she babysits on the weekends and owes her over \u00a35000 and has yet to pay a penny of that back all while my other works a very stressful job 5 days a week, when ever my mother talks to her co workers that she is friendly about this they all think my sister is a piss taker and is basically a selfish bastard, when ever my mother mentions that one day she wont be able to babysit my sister gets all pissy and falls out with my mother which makes her feel incredibly guilty when she is just trying to do what is right for her self especially when my sister can change her days she works and can easily get a different job in her field, she is currently a care worker and claims she cant find another job, yet when ever me or my mother go on indeed and simply look up care home/care worker we find dozens upon dozens of jobs. Basically i think my sister is being very selfish and is just refusing to find a new job so she can dump baby sitting duties on my mother but you all tell me what you think, is my mother being an asshole or are me and her co workers right when we say she should not feel guilty because it seems like my sis is using and making my mother feel guilty just so she can get a free baby sitter.", "output": "OTHER", "category": "Ethics Classification 1125.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, identify who is wrong here.

We've been through rough patches and worked through them all. We love eachother to bits. Ive told her that she's my first everything (from relationship to sexual stuff) - this is completely true. She told me the same and I believe her.\n\nSo the other night we were together getting takeout and I saw her logging in to her account on the delivery app. I saw her password and jokingly tried logging in to her social media account infront of her. The password worked and we both had a laugh because of it working but because we had to do something else I forgot to log off. \nThe next morning I woke up and scrolled through said social media site, *thinking I was logged in on my account*, I saw I had a DM from someone and opened it. As I was still fuzzy from waking up and confused because I didn't know the person messaging me I did a quick scroll through the list of contacts to see if I was on the wrong account. This is where any trusting BF may stop and log off but my eyes came to rest on a message where she texted the dude saying stuff like \"I love you\u2764\u2764\u2764\"\n\nThis worried me and upon further inspection I saw that she started talking with the guy during one of our rough patches, telling him that he's the only one for her and even sexual talk.\n\nI'm afraid to talk to her about it as it happened a while back and since then she's stopped talking to her.

Since John &amp; Lisa are dating we all go out together and chill. \n\nNow to the story: \nL talks to me about J allllll the time. She has been looking for other jobs in other cities around Europe but is now considering staying in Germany for J. She also in her 30s so looking to settle down soon. J is 27 and not super interested in that atm. \n\nAbout a month ago, J told C that he wants to break up with L but is terrible at these things. C then told me this information. So I have been sitting on this behemoth of a secret while L chats away about planning all this stuff for J. I try to casually slip in that she should really plan things for herself and maybe reevaluate the situation before putting plans on hold for a guy. She is not picking up on it.  Girl to girl, It\u2019s hard to watch her doing this when I know what\u2019s really going to happen. \n\nFast forward to last night. We are all out one last time since I got another job and am moving to another city. During this time while L is away, I asked J if he really is going to break up with her, because he should do it sooner rather then later. He says yes, but doesn\u2019t really know how or when etc. he wanted to do it after Christmas, but then she is going back home for a few weeks... etc etc \n\nThe night continues and many drinks later - L and I are outside the bar and she is complaining about J not wanting to make plans in March for a weekend away and other things. I try to tell her that maybe she should call things off since she is not really getting what she needs from this relationship. She says \u201cshe loves him\u201d etc and my big mouth just blurts out that he is going to break up with her and she should just end it. \n\nShe shouts at me, I go back inside, she runs to J crying, he looks at me, they walk out. \n\nI feel like the worlds biggest asshole and also like I am in grade school again. \n\nI apologised to both of them but feel like a massive idiot and an even worse friend. Neither will speak to me and I have no idea the status of that mess of a relationship. \n\nTl;dr - found out a friend wanted to break up with another friend- got drunk and told her that he was gonna do it.

I really liked my graduation photos and they are nowhere to be seen in her house or anyone else's in my family.
