SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``9/11 First Responders History \nProject Act of 2011''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Over 410,000 people were exposed to the site of the \n        September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center \n        (WTC) in New York City, including 50,000 workers from across \n        the Nation who traveled to the site to lend their support.\n            (2) Of these over 410,000 people, 91,000 were rescue and \n        recovery workers.\n            (3) Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was one of the \n        major health effects for individuals who responded to the WTC \n        attacks.\n            (4) Nineteen percent of adult enrollees (about 71,000 \n        people) in the WTC Health Registry report new PTSD symptoms, 4 \n        times the rate typically seen in adults in the United States.\n            (5) Of the more than 10,000 rescue and recovery workers \n        monitored for a study at the Mount Sinai WTC Consortium over a \n        five-year period from 2002 to 2007, 11% met criteria for \n        probable PTSD, 8.8% had probable depression, 5.0% had probable \n        panic disorder, and 62% had substantial stress reaction.\n            (6) According to the Mount Sinai study, the rate of PTSD \n        among responders to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks \n        at the WTC is significantly greater than in the general \n        population and is on par with the rate experienced by veterans \n        of the war in Afghanistan. For example, 15.5% of firefighters \n        report probable post-9/11 PTSD and firefighters who worked at \n        Ground Zero lost an average of 12 years of lung function.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to create a new \nfederally sponsored, authorized, and funded project that will \ncoordinate at a national level the collection of video and audio \nrecordings of personal histories and testimonials of emergency \nresponders and recovery and cleanup workers who responded to the \nSeptember 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that will build upon and \ncomplement previous and ongoing documentary work on this subject, and \nto assist and encourage local efforts to preserve the memories of such \nindividuals so that Americans of all current and future generations may \nhear from them directly and better appreciate the sacrifices they made.\n\nSEC. 3.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Parkinson's disease and related disorders (hereafter \n        referred to in this Act as ``Parkinson's'') is a neurological \n        disorder affecting as many as 1,500,000 Americans.\n            (2) Approximately 40 percent of persons with Parkinson's \n        are under the age of 60.\n            (3) While science has yet to determine what causes the \n        disease, research has found that cells that produce a \n        neurochemical called dopamine inexplicably degenerate, causing \n        uncontrollable tremors, muscle stiffness, and loss of motor \n        function.\n            (4) Eventually, Parkinson's renders its victims incapable \n        of caring for themselves. In addition to causing disability and \n        suffering for its victims, Parkinson's places tremendous and \n        prolonged physical, emotional, and financial strain on family \n        and loved ones.\n            (5) It is estimated that the disease costs society nearly \n        $6,000,000,000 annually.\n            (6) To date, the federally funded research effort has been \n        grossly underfunded.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Choices in Child Care Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Currently, child care assistance for children from low-\n        income working families is severely underfunded, allowing only \n        1 in 7 eligible children to receive child care assistance for \n        children from birth to age 13.\n            (2) Funding for the Child Care and Development Block Grant \n        Act of 1990 has remained relatively flat for 5 years, making it \n        more difficult for children from eligible families to receive \n        child care assistance.\n            (3) In the majority of United States families, parents, \n        whether married or single, must work to provide economic \n        security for their families and, not the least, for the infants \n        newly welcomed into the families. Fifty-five percent of women \n        with children less than 1 year of age are part of the \n        workforce, while 73 percent of women with children 1 year of \n        age or older are in the workforce.\n            (4) Research shows that the quality and nature of \n        caretaking in the first months and years of life are critical \n        to a young child's subsequent brain development, social \n        development, and well-being. Healthy early development depends \n        on nurturing and responsible relationships.\n            (5) Research also shows that there is an extreme shortage \n        of quality, affordable child care for infants. Numerous studies \n        document lack of infant care and, in particular, affordable \n        care that meets basic health and safety standards, particularly \n        in rural areas. The current number of infant slots of licensed \n        child care providers can only meet 18 percent of the potential \n        need. The shortage is even more acute in rural areas, \n        especially those with a high percentage of low-wage residents.\n            (6) For the well-being of United States children, and for \n        the economic security of the families on which the children \n        depend, working parents should be able to provide child care \n        for infants themselves without undermining family economic \n        stability.\n\nSEC. 3.

Breast \n        cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for U.S. women \n        between the ages of 20 and 59, and the leading cause of cancer \n        death for women worldwide.\n            (5) A woman in the United States has a 1 in 8 chance of \n        developing invasive breast cancer in her lifetime--this risk \n        was 1 in 11 in 1975. In 2001, a new case of breast cancer will \n        be diagnosed every 2 minutes, and a woman will die from breast \n        cancer every 13 minutes.\n            (6) All women are at risk for breast cancer. About 90 \n        percent of women who develop breast cancer do not have a family \n        history of the disease.\n            (7) The National Action Plan on Breast Cancer, a public \n        private partnership, has recognized the importance of expanding \n        the scope and breadth of biomedical, epidemiological, and \n        behavioral research activities related to the etiology of \n        breast cancer and the role of the environment.\n            (8) To date, there has been only a limited research \n        investment to expand the scope or coordinate efforts across \n        disciplines or work with the community to study the role of the \n        environment in the development of breast cancer.\n            (9) In order to take full advantage of the tremendous \n        potential for avenues of prevention, the Federal investment in \n        the role of the environment and the development of breast \ncancer should be expanded.\n            (10) In order to understand the effect of chemicals and \n        radiation on the development of cancer, multi-generational, \n        prospective studies are probably required.\n\nSEC. 3.

Permits earlier publication at the applicant's request. Prohibits disclosure of information concerning published applications except as determined by the Commissioner of Patents.  Prohibits, upon request by certain independent inventors, the publication of rejected applications, with specified exceptions, until three months after the Commissioner notifies the applicant.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Project Ready STEM Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Minorities are seriously underrepresented in the \n        science and engineering workforce in the United States, with \n        only 4 percent of the Black population and slightly over 4 \n        percent of the Hispanic population participating in the STEM \n        workforce.\n            (2) The number of degrees awarded in the fields of science, \n        technology, engineering, and math (referred to in this Act as \n        ``STEM'') in the United States is stagnant even though \n        employment projections forecast a 17-percent growth in STEM \n        fields over the next decade.\n            (3) Twenty percent of Black college students enter college \n        with STEM majors, but only 15 percent actually receive a \n        bachelor's degree in a STEM major.\n            (4) Nearly \\1/4\\ of Black public school students are \n        interested in STEM, but are not proficient in math.\n            (5) Since 1990, mathematic scores on the assessments \n        conducted by the National Assessment of Education Progress have \n        increased for all students, but White students have average \n        scores 26 points higher than Black and Hispanic students.\n            (6) After school programs play an important role in \n        addressing the achievement gap in underserved communities. \n        Studies demonstrate that STEM learning during the school day is \n        necessary but not sufficient for life-long STEM literacy.\n            (7) As many as 8,400,000 students are enrolled in after \n        school programs. Ethnic minority children are more likely than \n        non-minority children to participate in after school programs. \n        While 15 percent of all students are enrolled in after school \n        programs, 24 percent of Black students and 21 percent of \n        Hispanic students are enrolled in such programs.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to prepare middle school \nand secondary school students to be ready for opportunities in the STEM \nfields in college and in careers through strong after school, summer, \nand weekend programs that focus on STEM education.\n\nSEC. 3.

In \n        its decision, the Court also ruled that the United States is \n        responsible for the Tribe's loss of use of more than 2.85 \n        million acres.\n            (6) In October 2002, the United States Court of Federal \n        Claims adopted the sum of Two Hundred Seventy Million Six \n        Hundred Thousand Dollars ($270,600,000) as the jointly \n        stipulated amount of economic damages to be recovered by the \n        Alabama-Coushatta Tribe from the United States.\n            (7) There is pending before the United States District \n        Court for the Eastern District of Texas a lawsuit by the \n        Alabama-Coushatta Tribe, seeking declaratory and injunctive \n        relief based on the United States failure to discharge its \n        fiduciary duty to the Tribe.\n            (8) Despite the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe's strongly held \n        beliefs about the rights it possesses regarding its aboriginal \n        lands, the Tribe has decided to forego, relinquish, waive, and \n        otherwise disclaim any such rights, on the condition that \n        Congress authorize a restoration of its Federal status, as \n        hereinafter described.\n            (9) The Congress shares with the State of Texas and the \n        parties to this litigation a desire to empower the Alabama-\n        Coushatta Tribe to govern its own economic future and \n        appreciates the Tribe's willingness to forego its aboriginal \n        rights in exchange for improved economic self-sufficiency.\n            (10) This legislation represents a good faith effort on the \n        part of Congress to provide the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe with an \n        economic development opportunity under the same terms and \n        conditions as other federally recognized Indian tribes, in \n        exchange for the Tribe's agreement to relinquish its rights as \n        described above.\n            (11) In the absence of Congressional action, these land \n        claims and related claims will be pursued through the courts, a \n        process which in all likelihood will consume many years and \n        thereby promote hostility and uncertainty in the State of \n        Texas, to the ultimate detriment of the Alabama-Coushatta \n        Tribe, its members, and all other citizens of the State of \n        Texas.\n    (b) Purposes.--\n            It is the purpose of this subchapter--\n            (1) to recognize the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe's loss of its \n        aboriginal lands and the resulting loss of any economically \n        productive use of those lands for decades;\n            (2) to restore an economic development opportunity to the \n        Alabama-Coushatta Tribe on terms that are equal and fair;\n            (3) to resolve questions about the rights and obligations \n        of those landowners in Texas that hold title subject to the \n        Tribe's aboriginal title; and\n            (4) to insulate the Federal Government and taxpayers from \n        potentially greater and ongoing liability from these claims.\n\nSEC. 3. RESTORATION ACT AMENDMENT.\n\n    For the purpose of restoring an economic development opportunity on \nterms that are equal and fair, Section 207 of the Alabama-Coushatta \nTribes of Texas Restoration Act, Public Law 100-89 (25 U.S.C. 737) is \nhereby deleted.\n\nSEC. 4. JUDGMENT AND DISMISSAL OF LITIGATION.\n\n    Not later than six months after the date of enactment, the United \nStates and the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas shall execute and file \nwith the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas \nin the pending litigation a motion for entry of final judgment in \naccordance with the terms of this subchapter.\n\nSEC. 5. APPROVAL OF PRIOR TRANSFERS AND EXTINGUISHMENT OF CLAIMS AND \n              ABORIGINAL TITLE.\n\n    (a) Approval and Ratification of Prior Transfers.--\n            Any invalid transfer before the date of the introduction of \n        this legislation of land or natural resources located within \n        the State of Texas, including but not limited to transfers \n        pursuant to a statute or treaty of, or with, any State or the \n        United States, from, by, or on behalf of the Alabama-Coushatta \n        Tribe of Texas, or any predecessor in interest or any of its \n        members, shall be deemed to have been made in compliance with \n        the Constitution and all laws of the United States. Congress \n        hereby does approve and ratify any such invalid transfer \n        effective as of the date of said transfer.\n    (b) Extinguishment of Aboriginal Title.--\n            By virtue of the approval and ratification of a transfer of \n        land or natural resources effected by subsection (a) of this \n        section, any aboriginal title held by the Alabama-Coushatta \n        Tribe of Texas, or any predecessor in interest or any of its \n        members, to any land or natural resources the transfer of which \n        was approved and ratified by subsection (a) of this section \n        shall be regarded as extinguished as of the date of such \n        transfer.\n    (c) Extinguishment of Claims.--\n            By virtue of the approval and ratification of a transfer of \n        land or natural resources effected by this section, or the \n        extinguishment of aboriginal title effected hereby, any claim \n        (including any claim for damages for trespass or for use and \n        occupancy) by, or on behalf of, the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of \n        Texas, or any predecessor in interest or any of its members, \n        against the United States or the State of Texas which is based \n        on--\n            (1) any interest in or right involving any land or natural \n        resources the transfer of which was approved and ratified by \n        subsection (a) of this section, or\n            (2) any aboriginal title to land or natural resources the \n        extinguishment of which was effected by subsection (b) of this \n        section,\nshall be regarded as extinguished as of the date of any such transfer.\n    (d) Savings Provisions.--\n            (1) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect or \n        eliminate the personal claim of an individual Indian (except \n        for a Federal common law fraud claim) which is pursued under \n        any law of general applicability that protects non-Indians as \n        well as Indians.\n            (2) Nothing in this subchapter is intended to alter the \n        status of lands held in trust by the United States on behalf of \n        the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas.", "output": "Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas Equal and Fair Opportunity Settlement Act - Amends the Alabama-Coushatta Tribes of Texas Restoration Act to delete a provision prohibiting the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas from conducting gaming activities on its lands if those gaming activities are prohibited by Texas.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The use of large sums of cash is one of the most \n        reliable warning signs of drug trafficking, terrorism, money \n        laundering, racketeering, tax evasion, and similar crimes.\n            (2) The prevention, investigation, and prosecution of such \n        crimes depends upon the ability of law enforcement to deter and \n        trace such movements of cash, and the failure to report such \n        movements accordingly undermines law enforcement's ability to \n        prevent and detect serious criminal activity.\n            (3) The nonreporting of large cash transactions or \n        movements, in contravention of the provisions of subchapter II \n        of chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code, and regulations \n        prescribed under such subchapter, is therefore itself a serious \n        crime.\n            (4) The intentional transportation into or out of the \n        United States of large amounts of currency or monetary \n        instruments, in a manner designed to circumvent the mandatory \n        reporting provisions of such subchapter is the equivalent of, \n        and creates the same harm as, the smuggling of goods.\n            (5) The penalties in subchapter II of chapter 53 of title \n        31, United States Code, for nonreporting reflect the potential \n        harm caused by the crimes to which intentional nonreporting is \n        linked, and such penalties accordingly protect the following \n        important governmental interests:\n                    (A) The obligation of government to prevent the \n                manipulation of commerce and trade by criminals.\n                    (B) The cost to the government of investigating \n                criminal activity and enforcing the laws designed to \n                hinder such activity.\n                    (C) The government's underlying right to taxes \n                sought to be evaded through the movement of unreported \n                cash.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to authorize forfeiture \nof any cash or instruments whose movements are not reported under the \nterms of subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code, \nand regulations prescribed under such chapter, to emphasize the \nseriousness of the act of such nonreporting, and to prescribe \nguidelines for determining the amount of property subject to such \nforfeiture in various situations.\n\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n     This Act may be cited as ``The American Horse Slaughter Prevention \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n     Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Horses have played a significant role in the history \n        and culture of the United States.\n            (2) Horses in the United States are not raised for food or \n        fiber.\n            (3) As a non-food and recreational animal, horses should be \n        protected from slaughter.\n            (4) The foreign-owned horse slaughter industry has \n        slaughtered and exported for human consumption over 3 million \n        American horses in the last 2 decades.\n            (5) Approximately 55,000 American horses are slaughtered \n        for human consumption annually in the United States by foreign-\n        owned slaughterhouses. Tens of thousands of live horses are \n        exported from the United States annually for slaughter.\n            (6) Horses slaughtered in these foreign-owned plants in the \n        United States have often been hauled several thousand miles \n        over several days, contrary to acceptable non-slaughter \n        standards for water, food, and rest.\n            (7) Many horses shipped to slaughter are young, healthy \n        animals. Others are old, sick, blind, crippled and in otherwise \n        poor condition and are unfit to withstand the rigors of long \n        travel. Horses sent to be slaughtered are often shipped on \n        crowded double deck trucks designed for shorter necked species \n        such as pigs, cattle and sheep, and are forced to travel in a \n        bent position which can result in suffering, injury and death.\n            (8) Killing of horses by foreign-owned slaughterhouses in \n        the United States contrasts with the preferable method of \n        killing by chemical euthanasia.\n            (9) Horses endure repeated blows to the head with stunning \n        equipment that often does not render the animals unconscious. \n        Some horses proceed still conscious through the remaining \n        stages of slaughter being bled out and dismembered.\n            (10) Because horses in America are not food animals, \n        veterinarians commonly prescribe and treat horses with potent \n        drugs that may reside in the horseflesh and be dangerous when \n        consumed by humans.\n            (11) Because of the lack of disclosure on the part of the \n        agents and dealers for the slaughter plants people's horses are \n        many times acquired and slaughtered through fraud and \n        misrepresentation. Slaughter also provides a quick and \n        evidence-free outlet for stolen horses.\n            (12) The imposition of a ban on the sale of horseflesh for \n        human consumption, regardless of its source, is consistent with \n        the international obligations of the United States because it \n        applies equally to domestic and foreign producers and avoids \n        any discrimination among foreign sources of competing products. \n        Such a ban is also consistent with provisions of international \n        agreements to which the United States is a party that expressly \n        allow for measures designed to protect the health and welfare \n        of animals and to enjoin the use of deceptive trade practices \n        in international or domestic commerce.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n     The purpose of this Act is --\n            (1) to prohibit the slaughter of horses for human \n        consumption;\n            (2) to prohibit the sale, possession, and trade of \n        horseflesh for human consumption;\n            (3) to prohibit the sale, possession, and trade of live \n        horses for slaughter for human consumption.\n\nSEC. 4.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    ``This part may be cited as the `Class Size Reduction and Teacher \nQuality Act of 1999'.\n\n``SEC. 6602. FINDINGS.\n\n    ``Congress finds as follows:\n            ``(1) Rigorous research has shown that students attending \n        small classes in the early grades make more rapid educational \n        progress than students in larger classes, and that these \n        achievement gains persist through at least the elementary \n        grades.\n            ``(2) The benefits of smaller classes are greatest for \n        lower achieving, minority, poor, and inner-city children. One \n        study found that urban fourth-graders in smaller-than-average \n        classes were \\3/4\\ of a school year ahead of their counterparts \n        in larger-than-average classes.\n            ``(3) Teachers in small classes can provide students with \n        more individualized attention, spend more time on instruction \n        and less on other tasks, cover more material effectively, and \n        are better able to work with parents to further their \n        children's education.\n            ``(4) Smaller classes allow teachers to identify and work \n        more effectively with students who have learning disabilities \n        and, potentially, can reduce those students' need for special \n        education services in the later grades.\n            ``(5) Students in smaller classes are able to become more \n        actively engaged in learning than their peers in large classes.\n            ``(6) Efforts to improve educational achievement by \n        reducing class sizes in the early grades are likely to be more \n        successful if--\n                    ``(A) well-prepared teachers are hired and \n                appropriately assigned to fill additional classroom \n                positions; and\n                    ``(B) teachers receive intensive, continuing \n                training in working effectively in smaller classroom \n                settings.\n            ``(7) Several States have begun a serious effort to reduce \n        class sizes in the early elementary grades, but these actions \n        may be impeded by financial limitations or difficulties in \n        hiring well-prepared teachers.\n            ``(8) The Federal Government can assist in this effort by \n        providing funding for class-size reductions in grades 1 through \n        3, and by helping to ensure that the new teachers brought into \n        the classroom are well prepared.\n\n``SEC. 6603.
