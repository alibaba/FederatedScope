wrong. the formatting for documents needed to be a pdf which is fine, so i gathered everything needed, uploaded to a website service, converted it, downloaded it, and then uploaded and submitted it. however there was an error since my license and social card were .png files and not .tiff, which stands for tagged image file format, which also stands for the most unused, unheard of, and random picture format ever. so i uploaded my pictures to a 3rd party converting website, re-downloaded as .tiff, resubmitted it and came back with another error message. \u201ccolor was detected \u2013 please upload an image with color-free format\u201d. as a computer scientist i wondered why the designers of this website would want color-free images and the obvious answer is that it would save bandwidth (as well as database storage, but that\u2019s not really an issue nowadays) for the duration of uploading since a colored image is bigger, but for a large corporation like esperion (look at that \u2013 microsoft word even spell checked to the correct spelling of this company) i didn\u2019t think this should matter! and it\u2019s at the cost of readability (the black and white images were a lot less clear). anyways i now have two options: re-scan the images as black and white or use an online service to convert my coloring since i don\u2019t have photoshop installed. i opted for latter since it was simpler and got back imaged that were pretty much unreadable so i had to rescan my images as black-and-white anyways. so now i upload everything and still get the same \u201ccolor\u201d error regardless. all my files, including the pdfs, were black and white so i finally give up with their clearly broken and user-hating upload feature that they apparently want no one to use and call them to obtain an address to which i can send in my physical documents via snail mail. \n\nthis was a problem for me though, since chase only has until february 15th before they close my application and my intuition was telling me that resubmitting my application would mean that they would have to \u201chard pull\u201d my credit report from the credit reporting agencies, which is a factor in lowering your credit score. so i called chase and explained whole situation to them and asked for an extension to get everything in on time, to which they said \u201cno\u201d. in addition they told me that not only did i need to have to have my information corrected with the crediting agencies, but i had to provide them with proof of my valid ssn by going to the social security administration (ssa) and requesting a letter to send to chase notifying them of my correct number, called an ssr letter. the lending team representative could sense my sigh of frustration through the silence on the phone and even gave me an \u201ci\u2019m sorry, sir.\u201d yes, the only way this could get any worse was a trip to an official government building.\n\nso i got up early today to go to the ssa to request my ssr and after waiting in the midst of the very ethnic crowd of about 40 who were trying to get social security for about an hour, i was called up. i told the lady who clearly hated her job my predicament and halfway through she cut me off and tells me that she knows exactly what i\u2019m talking about but as of the end of 2014 must be done by the requesting agency via an online service. of course it should be since it\u2019s much easier to do things online. so i left and called chase, who had just sent me on a pointless goose hunt. the lady put me on hold while she reviewed my application, and after 10 minutes she came back saying \u201cwow, there are a lot of notes on your account\u201d. without me asking, she also told me that she would also send out another letter so that i would have another 30 days to complete everything for my application so big kudos to her. then she said that i could just send in my social security card as well as a cover letter explaining my situation, so here it is. \n\nchase sapphire preferred credit card, know this: i will have you.", "output": "triple check your credentials when submitting personal information for credit.", "category": "Summarization 1138.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text.

no, of course not. i came up with a great \"game\". the name explained its entirety. \"light a match with your teeth\". so i held a match in my mouth, and attempted to light it off the box. after several attempts, i managed. the smell caused me to choke, but even as i spat the match out, i thought, \"this is pretty cool!\"\n\ni encouraged my brothers to try it. we lit match after match, breathing in the smoke without a care in the world. not only did we spit them out into the grass (we were lucky enough to not catch anything else on fire), we kept going even as we started wheezing. after a few more minutes, my brother and i both had to go inside to use the nebulizer and inhaler. it took quite some time to get ourselves back into working order.\n\nby this time it was evening. but we weren't done, oh no. we decided we wanted to build a normal fire, so i asked my father if we could use the grill to make it safer, and if we could use a bucket to hold water in case the fire spread at all (though that wasn't what i intended to use the bucket for). i was given permission.\n\ni went into the back yard, taking the (new, $200) grill with me, and started building the fire. it was pretty cool, but kind of boring after a while. i filled up the bucket, and took some pieces of brick and placed them in the fire. after 10-15 minutes, the bricks were incandescent, and shone wonderfully in the darkness. i picked them up with two sticks and put them into the bucket, where they hissed and sputtered and cracked. once they were submerged, however, they stopped boiling the water.\n\nit was at this point that three things happened (or rather, one thing happened, i noticed another, and did a third). first, one piece of brick made contact with the side of the bucket and almost instantly burned a hole in it. it was a $20 bucket, and i'd just put a hole in it. i noticed something flicker in my peripheral vision, and turned to see the sticks i had used to pick up the bricks were, surprisingly (though not surprising in hindsight), on fire, and starting fires on the ground. i picked up the bucket and dumped the contents onto the sticks, putting the fire out. i then picked up the bricks, somehow thinking they were cooled off. i was wrong, and for that i received more burns.\n\nnot wanting to get in trouble over the bucket, i \"patched\" it with duck tape. i filled it with water again to see if it would leak. it didn't, fortunately.\n\ni now decided i'd had enough, having second degree burns on both hands, breathing problems, scorched eyebrows, and charred fingers on my right hand. so i did what any sensible person would do and doused the fire in the grill with the water from the bucket. i promptly forgot about it until about a week later when we went to grill some food and found that the water had rusted out the bottom of the grill almost completely. i feigned innocence, blaming the manufacturers.\n\ni got away with the incident with the grill, hid my injuries, and scraped off the charred portion of the outside of the house (and blamed the neighborhood cats). i got a minor talking-to about the bucket.\n\nafter that, i've become somewhat wary of fire, realizing now the extent of the damage i caused, and the potential damage i could have caused had i not been so lucky. this didn't stop me from starting a fire a few years later so hot that it caused nearby rocks to explode (again, i was extraordinarily lucky that no-one was severely injured).\n\ni still have scars from the burns, and they hurt terribly for days (though the parts burned the worst didn't hurt much, which i was grateful for at the time).\n\ni was a very sensible child.", "output": "played with fire, almost lit house on fire, burned my hands, almost killed brother with asthma, broke a grill and bucket totaling $220, burned hands again.", "category": "Summarization 1138.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text.
