this guy was straight up tripping and freaking out and shit. i guess he just can't take horror movies that well. this guy probably needs to watch the exorcist, but then again he'd probably piss his pants just by watching that.\n\nnow, my friend has two younger sisters, one of them being an 8 year old girl. she has this doll, which was in the basement. we kept passing the doll around, joking that it was annabelle. my friend would curl up whenever some spooky shit was going on in the movie, and as that happened, we would throw the ball at him, scaring him. by the end of the movie, we kept calling this doll \"annabelle\". \n\nthis doll didn't look nothing like the doll from the movie. it was a decently big doll actually, around 2 feet. it had blonde hair, and wore a green dress. it also had a bit of heft to it as well. throwing it at someone, it wouldn't be like hitting them with a brick or anything, but it did have a bit of impact.\n\nfast forward to a few hours later, and we all decide to go to bed. some slept on the floor with some bedsheets, while i slept on the rather comfy couch. my friend went to his room (in the basement) and slept in his bed. \n\nnot even 10 minutes in, i get this horrible idea. the doll, or annabelle as i should refer it to, was on the floor beside me, its shiny eyes reflecting the small bit of light coming from the window. i thought, \"hmm, what if i put the doll in his bed in the middle of the night, how would he react?\". i ask my buddy who's on the other couch what he thinks about this, and he's just like \"lol bro you gonna scare the fuck outta him, but yolo i'm down\". a few others who overheard also agree to this vile plan.\n\n*what a genius*, i thought to myself.\n\ni decide to wait a good 30 minutes, until i can confirm that my friend in his room is fast asleep. in the middle of the 2 am night, i tiptoe to his room, annabelle in hand, and slowly open the door. my friend is sleeping like a log on his bed. *perfect* i said to my self, and slowly walk up to his bed. with the dexterity of a surgeon, i tuck annabelle into the covers, right beside my friend. success! i carefully leave his room, close the door, and tiptoe back to my couch, where i laid down and fell asleep. it was a busy day, so i thought i could get some decent rest.\n\nor so i thought.\n\nit was probably around 5 am, where i woke up to the scream of a fucking high pitched banshee:\n\n**ahhhhhhhhh what the fuck**\n\nfollowed by the sound of a loud *thud*, and then the sound of glass shattering. most of us woke up, and ran over to his room. my friend was shaking, hyperventilating, his face that of a puppy scared of the clap of thunder, and in sweat. i think the sound of this guy's shrill scream woke me up fully, since i started laughing my ass off, until i realized the doll was missing...\n\nyou know how i said that the doll had some heft to it, not enough that it would hit like a brick, but still have some impact?\n\n\n\nyeah, it had enough heft that when my friend hurled it across the room with the strength of a baseball pitched, it smashed into the mirror, shattering it into a million pieces. annabelle was just lying beside the pile of shards, just chilling there, no damage to it whatsoever. \n\n\n\nso um, yeah. rainer, if you're reading this, i'm sorry dude^(but seriously grow some fucking balls and stop getting scared of shitty horror movies like this.)", "output": "tucked my sleeping friend to bed with a toddler-sized doll, guy clearly didn't appreciate it and spiraled it into his mirror.", "category": "Summarization 1138.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text.

the civic was so eager to go home that it just started rolling off all on its own. but not before aiming right at that amazing 1974 cadillac. \n\nso fuckup #1- i assumed it was still in gear with the e-brake still on. it wasn't!\n\nit gets better, because apparently 23yr old me thinks i'm superman. i proceed to try to stop this vehicle, and 95% succeed. i'm now standing behind this civic and almost holding it from continuing down the ramp. almost. meanwhile i'm screaming my fool head off for anybody to come to my rescue, nobody does. the car is slowly gaining ground.\n\nfuckup #2- thinking i can hold a civic up against the forces of gravity by myself. i can't!\n\nat this point, any normal person would just say screw the cadillac and jump out off the way, but not this guy. i'm superman damnit and i'm going to win. so i get this brilliant idea. i'm going to superman down the side of the vehicle, open the door, pull the e-brake and save the day. putting thoughts into action, i giv'r. i race down the side and open the door, reach in and miss the e-brake. the cars back tires have just dropped onto the ramp and gravity has suddenly gained an advantage. as the car picks up speed, i find myself between the open car door and the wall that is the bay door opening, the car goes through the opening but the car door pins my leg against the wall missing my dear precious nuts by 3\". as the car rolls through the opening my leg and the wall prevent the door from going through, the car door gets peeled off the car, and by the grace of the norse gods, causes the vehicle to turn just enough that it misses that goddamned 1974 pos cadillac.\n\nfuckup #3- thinking i'm actually superman and can fly. i can't.\n\nat this point i've finally caught the attention of the other employees. i'm limping bad and there is blood just below my nuts, somehow my finger is ripped open(still haven't figured that one out) and my adrenalin is pumping. so while i'm limping to the front, yelling \"call 911\", and taking my pants off (i like to multitask), the secretary finally shows up and just goes numb. all i need her to do was get the damn ambulance here. so she finally grabs the phone and gets things in motion, she then returns with a mug of water and mentions that i'm pale. no shit, i'm in shock and there is flesh and fat hanging out of a hole in my leg and as an added bonus, i can see the tendon in my left pointing finger. at this point i ask her for a pen and paper. she looks at me. pen and paper...blank stare...wtf!

i didn't have much work going on, so i decided to hang out with some of my family. it was basically the three of us, and we all went to different colleges in the area. we spend the day chilling and hanging out, restock and stuff like that, then we return to relative a's college campus, as relative b is the driver in this scenario. so we get back on campus, and some people who i used to know now go there, how ironic. i knew them from a couple years back and i didn't think they would be going to the same college as relative a, so you can imagine how surprised and happy i was. so i tell my relatives that i'm going to catch up with a few people who i haven't hung out with in a long time, and they say that they're fine with it. flash forward thirty minutes later, and one of them asks me if i want to get high. i think to myself \"nah i really shouldn't, because should get relative b to drive me back to my campus,\" but at the same time i did, at one point in a drunken stupor, promise him that we'd get high together. not to mention that it was the first blunt that he had ever rolled in his life, so it was pretty special to him. so me being the idiot i am decide to go for it, it couldn't be that bad. i call relative b and tell him that i'm going to stay on campus for a little longer, and he says he needs to leave soon. i ask around for anyone else who might be headed back to my campus, and they say that there is a shuttle that runs that will get me back on campus safe and sound. it was all falling into place, right?\n\nso we go out into the woods and get high, and it'd been a really long time since i got high, so you can imagine that it hit me like a brick. i was in cloud 9 for the next half hour, when i realized that the shuttle was almost on its way (it's getting dark and things are well into the evening at this point). so i tell them that i'm going to go to the shuttle stop and wait on the shuttle.\n\nnow what i didn't know, was that the shuttle stop had actually changed from where it is listed on the campus map, and that i was sitting in the wrong place. next thing you know, i see the shuttle that i needed to be on drive by full speed. now, rationally speaking, if i wasn't so high maybe this next part wouldn't've happened. i see the shuttle continue on by, and i get up from the bench and sprint to try to catch it. i'm running through uneven woods in the dark of night, high as a kite, trying to get to a shuttle that was only picking up speed. you can imagine this didn't work out well. about a couple hundred meters later, i give up and the desperacy kicks in. that's when i realized, i fucked up.\n\ni walk back onto campus and call my friend who i was hanging out with and ask him where the shuttle actually picks up, and ten minutes later i get back on campus and he shows me. still not thinking straight, i decide to just sit there and wait. it was roughly 11 pm at this point, and that's when fuck up #2 came upon me: i was supposed to do something for my girlfriend at midnight for her birthday. this wouldn't've been such an issue, but she's not fond of drugs or drug usage at all. i would've gotten a ride from relative b, but he was already back on his campus, and plus i didn't really want him to see me as high as i was at the time.\n\nso i'm sitting on the bench, and i figure \"maybe i can call her and wish her happy birthday right quick,\" and then i see my phone has only about 7% battery, most of it being used up with me trying to track the shuttle and see if there was another one coming. so i call her, she doesn't pick up. i call her again, still no answer. i'm now at about 4% between calling and tracking the bus, and it's getting colder as well. i see if i can crash in someone's room, so i call my friend again and ask him if i can crash in his room until the shuttle comes back, and he lets me into the room. after this call, my phone is finally dead and useless.\n\nnow i'm high in my stoner friend's room, fun stuff. a lot of his stuff still smelled like weed, including his bed which i foolishly decided to flop on top of in frustration. so i spend a few minutes with him, talking and chilling, then he asks if i know when the shuttle is supposed to get back in. he check's online and the shuttle site says \"shuttles depart every 45 minutes,\" and it had been about 30 since the last one took off. so he tells me that i should go outside and wait for the next one since it should've come back around in 15 minutes. he and i walk out to the shuttle stop, and then he says his goodbyes and i'm back to square one.\n\nwhat i didn't know was that there would've been a shuttle, but the second shuttle wasn't running. this means that i had an hour, not 15 minutes, until the next shuttle arrived, plus a bit longer due to road work bottle-necking traffic on the interstate.\n\nso there i am, high, alone, sitting on the single bench next to a lamp post, smelling like weed the entire time. a couple of times some campus police officers would drive by and ask me if i was okay, but i just told them that i was waiting on the next shuttle, insisting that they can head on the other way (because i smelled like weed, it would've been horrible if they had actually gotten out to talk to me.)\n\nflash forward an hour and a half later, the shuttle finally comes back, i take the 45 minute ride back to campus (still pretty high and reeking of weed), once i get back the shuttle that stops closest to my room is unloading so i rush to hop onto it, getting weird looks from everyone on board. i eventually get back to my room, order a pizza, eat it, then crash on my bed, telling myself before i fell asleep \"you fucked up.\"", "output": "i got high, missed a shuttle, decided to chase
