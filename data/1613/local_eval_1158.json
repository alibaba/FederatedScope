On Earth, a body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, not part of the ocean, is larger and deeper than a pond, and is fed by a river.

Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing or recent glaciation. Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last Ice Age.

An individual who inherits such deleterious traits is colloquially referred to as inbred. The avoidance of expression of such deleterious recessive alleles caused by inbreeding, via inbreeding avoidance mechanisms, is the main selective reason for outcrossing.[6][7] Crossbreeding between populations also often has positive effects on fitness-related traits,[8] but also sometimes leads to negative effects known as outbreeding depression. However increased homozygosity increases probability of fixing beneficial alleles and also slightly decreases probability of fixing deleterious alleles in population.[9] Inbreeding can result in purging of deleterious alleles from a population through purifying selection.[10][11][12]. \nStory: Ralph owns a farm with a small population of cows on it. He needs to breed them to expand his population but is unsure how to do it. He finds out that most of his cows are closely related in some way and has a small amount of diversity. His friend from another farm however has a diverse set of cows and offers to help with Ralph's breeding problem for an extra cost.", "output": "If Ralph wants to avoid inbreeding, what solution should he go for in his breeding practices; use his own cows, or pay his friend for help?, Will Ralph more than likely have better or worse results if he pays extra to have a diverse set of cows to breed with his own?", "category": "Question Generation 59.json"}, {"instruction": "You are given a background paragraph that describes one or more causal or qualitative relationships such as a relationship in economics or a scientific law and a story that makes use of the concepts or the relationship described in the provided paragraph.

This is called the adolescent growth spurt. In boys, it is controlled by testosterone. The rate of growth usually starts to increase relatively early in puberty. At its peak rate, growth in height is about 10 centimeters (almost 4 inches) per year in the average male. Growth generally remains rapid for several years. Growth and development of muscles occur toward the end of the growth spurt in height. Muscles may continue to develop and gain strength after growth in height is finished. \nStory: Jimothy and Dwight are two brothers living in the same house. Jimothy is a freshman in high school and Dwight is a junior in high school. Their mother takes them to see a doctor and to have their testosterone tested. The tests reveal that Dwight has significantly more testosterone than Jimothy, but that is to be expected given their age difference.", "output": "Which boy will more likely grow less inches of the course of one year?, Which boy will more likely grow more inches of the course of one year?, Which boy will start developing muscles later?, Which boy will start developing muscles sooner?, Will Dwight finish his growth spurt before or after Jimothy?, Will Jimothy finish his growth spurt before or after Dwight?", "category": "Question Generation 59.json"}, {"instruction": "You are given a background paragraph that describes one or more causal or qualitative relationships such as a relationship in economics or a scientific law and a story that makes use of the concepts or the relationship described in the provided paragraph.

Over land, winds maximize at hill or mountain crests, while sheltering leads to lower wind speeds in valleys and lee slopes.[11] Compared to over water, maximum sustained winds over land average 8% lower.[12] More specifically, over a city or rough terrain, the wind gradient effect could cause a reduction of 40% to 50% of the geostrophic wind speed aloft; while over open water or ice, the reduction is between 10% and 30%.[8][13][14]. \nStory: The Johnson Family is planning a couple of excursions next week.
