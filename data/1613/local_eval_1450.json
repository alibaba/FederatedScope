One of them is quiet, the other speaks loudly but turns it down when asked to, and the last one is a guy who thinks he can do whatever he pleases. This last guy has been kind of an AH the entire night (and for a day or two), doing shitty and resentful comments, and it kinda got to my nerves so I asked all of them to keep it down, please. This guy keeps arguing with loud guy, after telling me he will not pay back the food we ordered (he's kinda on a tight budget also), and had told me before he doesn't give a shitty about my roommate.\n\nThen, the pivotal moment.\n\nI calmly told him to shut up, that he is really annoying and I'm losing my patience, so I'm considering kicking him out. He then said \"lol you can't do that\", to which I replied \"wanna see?\" So I open the door and tell him to go ahead twice. If he did, I would've given him another chance.\n\nHe then complied and went to sleep.\n\nThen, the day after, everyone is mad at me for doing that, telling me I overreacted, and that it is a shitty thing to do.\n\nHis arguments particularly are that he values \"loyalty\" and he wasn't even responsible for the volume of the conversation.  Loud guy hasn't given me his opinion, but obnoxious guy says that he also thinks I am the asshole. Quiet guy says I'm totally the asshole, that kicking out a friend is a really shitty thing to do, especially to friends; that if he's resentful, he could be going through rough times and I should support him, not kick him out. SO thinks I'm NTA because I didn't effectively kick him out, and that I shouldn't put up with him; friends or not, he's being disrespectful and obnoxious.\n\nI'm really annoyed by this situation and no one satisfies my moral discomfort. I'd really like to hear your thoughts/critics/analysis on this and if possible to give me advice on what to do.\n\nThank you very much in advance, and sorry if bad English, it not first tongue.", "output": "RIGHT", "category": "Ethics Classification 852.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task you are given an anecdote, which recount a complex ethical situation.

I truly believed we were deeply in love. It was by no means always harmonious, but we always thought our relationship was worth fighting for. I\u2019m not a greedy bitch when it comes to money. I stayed with my parents and the first time I truly lived on my own was when I moved in with him a month ago.\n\nMy ex is absolutely awful with money. He spends it frivolously on eating out, alcohol, and before I encouraged him to get clean, drugs. But he is also a hard worker. When we got more serious, I started being a bit controlling and speaking up about his spending habits because he was always broke. Before we lived together, I helped him with rent on multiple occasions. I would have done anything for him, and if I had it, he had it. I admit towards the end I started being resentful because I felt like I was almost at time taking care of HIM when I wanted him, the guy, to take care of me...\n\nFast forward, our relationship ended abruptly and it got nasty. So much pent up anger and feelings reLeased. The only month I lived with him (first week of March), I paid my entire check from a new job I started. $900 (not a lot) of our $1200 rent. Unfortunately I was fired the very next day (no regrets, was being sexually harassed at work every day.) He paid the rest, but he didn\u2019t have enough to pay half because he started working a new job after me. I moved out after we broke up and now I\u2019m demanding he pay half of what I paid for the rent, $450, considering I\u2019m in a shitty situation (No savings, but I did manage to get a job I haven\u2019t started). At first, he said he would help, but he of course spent money on partying for ST. P. I asked him yesterday when he was going to pay me, he said he couldn\u2019t give it to me in full because he has court. \n\nWhen I tell y\u2019all I\u2019m fucking livid!! I feel absolutely used. He has a great job now and I feel like he truly won\u2019t pay me back because he has no self-awareness and truly doesn\u2019t care. Part of me wants karma to play out and just leave it, the other part of me wants to hit that bitch up every day until he pays me back.\n\nSo AITA for demanding the rent money back?

We invited a few close friends and a married couple that we'll call A(30M) and B(29F). It's a fair amount of money to go so we offered to buy everyone's tickets if they pay for their camping slots. (Camping slots are sold as 4-person tents so each person would pay for one quarter of a tent. Tickets are more expensive than camping slots.) Because it's a big decision and the festival does not do refunds, we gave them about 6 months to decide. After that, we got everyone's money who said yes and purchased everything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA month later (6 months ago now), B separated from A. (It's a situation where she has grown a lot and he has been very stagnant, relying heavily on her for emotional support.) In that time, we've tried to figure out if she is still coming or what we should do. At first, she hadn't decided and then she stopped responding. Our wedding is now 2 months away and we told her we are just going forward as if she's not coming. She called us pretty much immediately to say sorry and that she's not coming. She didn't say anything about money. Weeks later she called and said that she just signed a new lease, lost her job, and needs her camping money back. We told her that it's already been spent, but that we'll re-ask the few people who originally said no and if any change their minds she can get her money back. Well, none of them did, so we told her sorry and left it at that. She responded that she'll just try to sell her ticket instead. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing is, the ticket is not hers to sell. We bought them, so if anyone should resell it for money it should be us. Both she and us are out money. Why should she then get money back and not us?

Apparently I have noticed a classmate of mine that always seem to be down in drains. So one day I decided to help him out as we weren't particularly strangers, I walked up to him and I asked him what was wrong and listened to him patiently. Turns out he was an extremely sensitive person that really cares about people's judgement and gets sad everytime he feels that he isn't doing good enough. He felt much better after talking about his problems.\n\nBut here's where the problem start, a few days later he asked my desk mate to move away so he could seat right next to me, knowing he was very sensitive, my desk mate obliged. The first few weeks were fine, we had a few deep conversations and cracked a few jokes along them. But then it started to get out-of-hand from there, he won't let me talk to other people and feel real sad when I left him. Everytime I talk with a few friends, he drags me back so I could talk with him. He follows me everywhere and overwhelm me with his negativity and pessimistic views about life. I mean I get that he is sad but he is almost basing his entire personality on the fact that he is sad. \n\nBut the real frustrating problem is he keeps bugging me during class. As I said I have a huge test coming up, but this dude keeps cracking unfunny jokes in between that really is a distraction. I told him to stop but he just gets all sad and negative about it. So after an entire month of that, I decided to ignore him for a bit. I moved seat because I have decided that my own wellbeing is the priority but everytime I catch sight of him in the backseat, looking so damn sad and alone, I can't help but feel guilty about it.

We are all sixteen. \n\nWe spent the whole day together, playing mario kart, getting food, having a good time. I had to go home at midnight. but my girlfriend was talking about how her friend, (let\u2019s call him D, for douchebag) was going to sneak into her house at 1. When she first talked about it, my whole mood changed.\n\nI trust my girlfriend with everything, but I do not trust D. Sure, we are all mutual friends, in fact, D is quite fond of me. The thing is, a month prior, me, D, my girlfriend, and two other friends were hanging out, and I repeatedly saw D staring at my girlfriends caboose. I told her about this, and she started defending him. She did the whole, \u201cI\u2019m not saying you\u2019re wrong, but are you sure you really saw what you think you did?\u201d Yeah, didn\u2019t feel too good. \n\nA week prior to this, I had told her how her sneaking him into her house made me feel super uncomfortable. My argument was if she can\u2019t sneak me into her house, she shouldn\u2019t sneak another dude. She didn\u2019t really fully listen to my argument, because she said \u201cIt\u2019s just what WE DO, it\u2019s what our friend group has always done!\u201d\n\nSo, Saturday night comes around and they sneak D in. He brought a dab pen and a Juul. They hang out, and he left at 5. On the drive home, I damn near had a mental breakdown. I felt like I was having a heart attack, and knowing that D having a dab pen with my girlfriend and being a horn-dog was a recipe for disaster. Was the thought of that kid fucking around with my girlfriend plausible? Possibly. Was it my anxieties getting the best of me? Most likely, but regardless, I shouldn\u2019t be put in that situation anyways.\n\nSunday morning comes around, and she could tell something was wrong because I didn\u2019t talk to her once I got home, I just gave her a \u201cgoodnight\u201d which I never do. \n\nI tell her the way she made me feel was the worst I had ever felt. The sole fact that she would sneak a dude that isn\u2019t me into her house made me uncomfortable as it is, let alone\n\n1. He had weed with him (he had her hit the dab pen, this makes me mad at him, not her, in this case).\n2. If they got caught, she wouldn\u2019t be able to hang out with me at least until 2019\n3. He\u2019s a horn dog who I have seen staring at her ass\n4. If I ever snuck a girl with weed into my house, she would have a goddamn epiphany\n\nShe started by trying to defend D, saying \u201cOh it\u2019s just what we do, and D is a very good friend of mine.\u201d\n\nI kept detailing how shitty it made me feel, and she realized she fucked up. She began crying and profusely apologizing. She said she was sick with herself. I told her I didn\u2019t mean to make her feel that way, but I was not okay with what she did and I needed to tell her. She cried more, and got off of her phone. We FaceTime later and talk about it for 4 hours. It was less of an argument, and more of a debate, because while this pissed me off monumentally I am pretty good at not starting an \u201cargument\u201d. \n\nShe eventually admits that she knows what she did was wrong, but she didn\u2019t at the time. She then goes on to tell me that she doesn\u2019t usually care what happens to her, and she always tries to put her friends first, because she hopes it will make her happier. I believe she may have been trying to guilt trip me? I don\u2019t know, but I said \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way, I really am, but the risk she took that night risked our entire relationship and that is not an okay risk to take. She keeps apologizing, and I keep saying that I accept her apology, but we will have a real problem if that happens again.\n\nSo here we are now. After many days of being angry with each other, we are back to normal and ready for Christmas. \n\nI still feel a little shaken up over it, and I never really got an apology for what she did, just for how it made me feel.\n\nI\u2019m not going to push her about it anymore unless it happens again. It was our first big argument, and I don\u2019t want that to happen again.\n\nTell me what you think.\n\n\nTLDR; Girlfriend sneaks a guy friend into her house in the dead of night against my wishes, I tell her how that made me feel, she starts self deprecating and making me feel bad, whilst also apologizing for the wrong thing, and we argue.

To not go too far into detail about it, my dad got involved in my new car purchase and coerced me to go against my better judgement and buy this 2006 bmw that he found online for about the same price instead of the one I had picked out and was going to buy (2007 Volvo S60 R) which, might I add, was in perfect condition. When I looked at the bmw it seemed to be in decent condition apart from some obvious problem areas that I knew would need to be addressed (new wheels, appeared to be an oil leak, needed new driver side headlight) which also gave me a bad feeling in my gut. long story short I end up buying the bmw cause my dad went ahead and out some of my money in as a down payment for it (he likes to eat involved with things). \n\nOk so fast forward about 6 months and I have so far sunk about 2000$ into this car on necessary fixes that turned out to be big repairs (I\u2019m still kicking myself in the ass for buying this money pit). One thing in particular that still hadn\u2019t been fixed was the driver side headlight. The problem with it was that water had been able to leak into the headlight over years and years causing the clear plastic to be permanently cloudy and also messed up some electrical components which caused the adaptive headlight not to work (turns the lights left and right when going around corners and is a very intricate assembly so can\u2019t be fixed with a simple bulb replacement). Since I don\u2019t have a lot of money being a recent grad and am only working an entry level job, I can only make the repairs once I save enough money and the whole replacement OEM headlight assembly would cost about 5-600$. \n\nAlso for a side note I\u2019m big on doing things correctly the first time and of course I\u2019ll try to save money when I can but I will opt to spent the extra buck when something really counts and needs to be done right. \n\nSo a couple of weeks ago my dad gifted me a replacement headlight assembly so I could save the 500$ for something else. The other day I took the old one out and tried putting the new one in. First I hooked up all the plugs to make sure it worked but there was one plug that didn\u2019t have a spot to connect to. I looked closer and realized that these were not the same kind of headlight. The main difference being that the replacement did not have the adaptive headlight assembly inside it and was just a regular bulb (the light from the replacement was yellow and much dimmer than the original passenger side light that was white light) On top of that, the holes for the screws didn\u2019t line up right with the frame and required a little persuasion to fit. Also on the original there\u2019s a separate arm piece that clips into one corner of the headlight and then is screwed into the frame. The replacement had the spot where the piece sits in but not the part where it clips into the headlight itself so it sits in the opening loosely. Without this arm attached, the headlight wiggled around. So now I\u2019m thinking that the replacement is just a cheap knockoff. I told my dad about the light and that as much as I really appreciated his gift I can\u2019t use it cause I\u2019m worried about it coming loose or breaking (being as that it wouldn\u2019t be completely mounted and the material felt very fragile) and he acknowledged. So I figured I\u2019d just take it out and put the old one back in the next day as I was running out of daylight and didn\u2019t feel like fiddling with it anymore (kind of a pain in the ass to get it in/out) \n\nThe next day I get up around 10 cause it\u2019s a Saturday and It\u2019s the only day I get to sleep in. When I go downstairs my dad tells me that he was able to get the headlight mounted correctly and that he fixed it. When I go out I see that the arm is attached to the frame on the spot on the light where\u2019s it\u2019s supposed to be. I look closer and I see a big crack in the side of the opening where the arm sits and super glue all around it (looked like he forced it in and it snapped). Then I see a big smear of superglue that dripped off the arm area onto the front of the headlight onto the clear plastic that had been partially wiped but looked like it was wiped off a bit too late and managed to dry. So now not only can I not return the replacement headlight because it\u2019s damaged but I\u2019m pretty much stuck with it. I told him that I appreciate him trying to help but as much as I tried to not get mad I got pretty upset at him doing things to my car without my knowledge. \n\nAITA for trying to give my dad back the gift and getting upset with him about him \u201cfixing\u201d the replacement and rendering it nonreturnable?", "output": "RIGHT", "category": "Ethics Classification 852.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task you are given an anecdote, which recount a complex ethical situation.

TL;DR at end.)\n\nI\u2019m a chef, I hired this guy as my sous almost two years ago.  He has diabetes.  He\u2019s always sick, especially when it\u2019s really inconvenient, like when I am out of town or when we have really busy weeks with lots of banquets or offsite events.  I brought it up to him in the past, if he thought stress exacerbated it, because whenever we were really busy and I needed his help, boom! in the hospital.\n\nEventually, I had to take him off of salary bc he was missing too much work and I told him, you know I don\u2019t wanna fire you, I understand you don\u2019t have control over this, blah blah blah, but I\u2019m not paying you a salary when I can\u2019t depend on you.  So I put him on an hourly wage instead and I promoted one of my other cooks as a sort of junior sous chef so I had a fall back for 1st sous chefs eventual sick days and to ease the stress on 1st sous so he wasn\u2019t pushing himself so hard.\n\nHe\u2019s got this stomach thing where it goes into paralysis and won\u2019t digest the food sitting in this stomach and then when it starts pumping (?) again and drops all of the old food into his gut he gets really ill.  Apparently this happens with diabetes?  I have also, more than once, found him passed out on the floor of the employee room when he\u2019s gone up for a shot.  When he gets sick and goes home I won\u2019t hear from him for days and have to contact his sons to see if he\u2019s dead.  I ask him about it after and he says he just comes to after days and has to look at a calendar to see how long he missed. \n\n1st sous chef has had this illness for 20 years.  He refuses to go to the doctor for regular treatment or even when he\u2019s ill.  When I say \u201cin the hospital\u201d it\u2019s because he gets so fucking sick that his kids call 911 (they\u2019re all grown adults BTW).  He does take insulin, but that\u2019s as far as any self treatment goes.  He smokes like a chimney and drinks like a fish.  I know lots of other people with diabetes, my aunt for example has never ever had to go to the doctor for complications due to diabetes, neither did my friend in high school (and he was 17 and an idiot), and neither does my CURRENT prep cook, who ALSO has diabetes.  Because they take care of themselves! My prep cook brings himself little sugar free cookies and bananas to work with him and eats these cactus tortillas bc they have less sugar than corn. So it\u2019s increasingly frustrating to deal with his constant sickness, not because of the inconvenience to me and the business, I solved that with 2nd sous chef, but because we\u2019re all watching this dude kill himself in front of us and he\u2019s the most stubborn mother fucker in the world and it\u2019s breaking my heart.\n\nOk, so last Friday I\u2019m up in my office doing some paperwork and go into the kitchen to check on things and 1st sous is gone, 2nd sous says he got really sick and left an hour earlier.  No big deal, we\u2019re extra staffed with a new guy training so I\u2019m not worried about it and leave at my normal time.  Saturday 1st sous is a no show, I text and call, but as usual hear nothing.  2nd Sous coincidentally lives with 1st, so I ask him if he\u2019s okay and he says he hasn\u2019t talked to him that he was asleep when he got home the night before and was still sleeping when he left for work in the morning.  My days off are Sun. and Mon. and 2nd sous is going out of town to visit his fam for Thanksgiving, so I assume I\u2019m going to be working on both of my days off to cover for 1st sous.  C\u2019est le vie, they\u2019re super slow days so boring, but no biggie.\n\nTuesday comes and 1st sous comes in to talk to me.  We go outside and he tells me he found a diabetic ulcer on his foot and that it started to \u201cstink\u201d on Sunday.  He refuses to go the doctor bc he knows they\u2019re going to tell him to amputate.  His plan is to cut off the dead tissue himself, apparently he\u2019s done this before (\u2026) and his friend gave him some weird oil shit that\u2019s supposed to kill the infection before it can get into his blood stream (I forgot to mention, he says he is allergic to all antibiotics) I try and talk him out of it and tell him prosthesis have improved, he\u2019ll be able to do everything he can now, no one will even be able to tell, but he won\u2019t even consider it because HE WON\u2019T STOP DRINKING AND SMOKING.  Like it\u2019s his fucking life blood, I was like, what?!  You won\u2019t stop smoking to have more time with your kids?   And he shrugged and said he\u2019s raised 5 good men and they don\u2019t need him.  Basically he wants me to give him two weeks to \u201cget back to normal.\u201d  In my opinion, he is not going to get back to normal.  He is going to ignore this until he gets blood poisoning and dies.  I told him that I think he shouldn\u2019t waste what time he has left working and that he should spend it with his kids and he said, yeah maybe.\n\nThis situation has been really stressful in a lot of ways, I really care about him and I obviously don\u2019t want him to fucking die and he was crying telling me and I was crying and it was all very awful.  After our talk he went back inside and drank a whiskey while I input invoices, so what can ya do, he\u2019s not going to change for anything including his own life.\n\nThe owner of my place told me that I can\u2019t fire him over this.  I said I\u2019m not going to watch him commit suicide in front of me and that\u2019s not fucking fair to the staff and that it\u2019s not doing him any favors allowing him to continue working.  Every step he takes will be pushing the infection into his bloodstream (I\u2019m not a doctor, but I believe you\u2019re supposed to \u201coff weight\u201d?) It might seem callous, but I really don\u2019t want to let him back.  I honestly think it would be better to fire him because if he was unemployed he could get Medicaid, maybe hospice care, maybe die with some dignity instead of fainting in the bathroom at the bar after a long shift without eating.  Even in the event that he pulls off some sort of miraculous hobo surgery on himself and gets all the necrotic tissue out, how long until it happens again?  His kids are all moving away, 2nd sous is moving out of their house, who\u2019s going to call 911 next time? I worried I'm being selfish.  One of my cooks pointed out that maybe he really really loves cooking and wants to die doing it.  Ummm, I love cooking too, but I certainly would not be working myself into a grave were I in this situation, I love other things more. \n\nSo, AITA?\n\nTL;DR Sous chef is dying from complications from diabetes, refuses medical help, is literally going to cut away parts of his own foot, and wants me to hold his job for him until he recovers.  I think firing him is for his own good, the owner says I shouldn\u2019t, am I the asshole?", "output": "RIGHT", "category": "Ethics Classification 852.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task you are given an anecdote, which recount a complex ethical situation.

Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it.

Let me explain.\n\nMy close friend got married to a dog lover. They have 2 weimaraners and they are absolutely insane. They've had then for about 2 years and they both stay inside always. They do not listen, they bark incessantly, and they will jump all over you and scratch the shit out of you with their claws and gnaw at your hands with their mouths. What angers me the most is the wife always makes up some kind of excuse for their behavior.\n\n\"Oh they're just excited\"\n\"She's just showing affection\"\n\"I would never put my dogs outside, you wouldn't put your kids outside would you?\"\n\nI get it. People love dogs and cats and I'm on the other side of that spectrum. I can tolerate and enjoy dogs but their not my thing.\n\nSo here's whats got me a frustrated.\n\nI recently gave my friend, J, his christmas gift. I gave him my deceased brothers Xbox One. My brother passed a couple years ago and I kept his xbox but it stayed in my basement collecting dust and since I have a ps4 I never really used it and it didnt seem fair to let it sit there. So I decided a month ago since me and J were getting along so well that he should receive it because he only has a xbox 360. \n\nSo we were texting tonight and he suggested i come over and bring my 4 year old daughter. Last time I brought her those dogs cornered her and scratched her legs with their paws. So I texted him and asked if he could rein his dogs in since my daughter didnt like being scratched(more like I'll kill a dog if they hurt her). His response was, 'I cant do anything about that.'   ....I'm trying to be a reasonable person but wtf man? Cant keep your dogs in check?? Or put them in the other room for a small amount of time? \n\nSo I say cmon man im just protecting my kid from scratches. He asks, 'What do you want me to do?'\n\nAt this point I'm hurt and fucking angry. I can feel my blood pumping over a stupidass text convo. I tell him I just dont want her scratched and all I get is 'i cant help that.' So I just tell him I'll come over when I'm not watching my daughter one day and thats the end of the conversation. \n\nAt this point I'm ready to say fuck it.
