Take the plastic off and the cardboard sleeve is totally worn on every edge like it's seen years of abuse. Open the plastic case that contains the discs and the case is damaged and the part that holds the discs in and allows you to flip through them is broken and so there's a whole bunch of broken plastic pieces scattered inside the case and now there's nothing holding the disc holders in place inside the case.

Being a glasses wearer, I found that I had no pain at the back of my ears where my glasses set. Meaning, the headphones don\u2019t apply to much pressure. When I have it connected to my cell phone, there is a simple one push button process to take and end a call and I can control the volume through the phone or the headphones themselves. The headband is soft and flexible which remains comfortable after long periods of use. I use my headphones a lot when listening to audio books and find the sound quality is just as clear when hearing the narrator speak as when listening to music. Crisp and crystal clear. It came with a nice bag for storing it when not in use, as well as the necessary charging and audio cables.

If you\u2019re a fan of expensive nail polishes stay away from this product! I\u2019ve ruined two bottles of my favorite nail polish before I realized that it was 100% acetone!", "output": "negative", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 430.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, You are given a review of Amazon's food products.

I liked it at first but comparing it to the ones I purchased from Liberty Imports these cars look SO MUCH CHEAPER and feels so flimsy and weak. Initially what I liked about these were the friction wheels seemed more intact and aligned compared the my other purchase, until the day it happened and the friction started messing up and would not roll as good as before. I've tried reaching to the seller but they were giving me such a hard time that I honestly dont want to deal with them anymore and just having to return them back to amazon. Overall with the cheap look, cheap plastic material and design, cheap wheels, and horrible customer service I would give it negative star if I could. Stray away from this and go somewhere else like Liberty Imports. Looks so much better, feels sturdier, and more worth your money.", "output": "negative", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 430.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, You are given a review of Amazon's food products.

I didn't have super high expectations but I figured it was something that you know I could really just place my pocket watches in and even display them in my closet. I decided to return this for two reasons one it really feels like somebody took cardboard and painted over it and then number two it arrived without the insert.
