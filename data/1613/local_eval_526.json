Thirty patients were asymptomatic, with normal LV ejection fractions (\u2265 55%), without other significant valvular disease or wall motion abnormalities.

Both groups were also compared with 32 healthy subjects with similar age and gender distributions and normal echocardiographic results who served as controls. LV longitudinal and circumferential strain and rotation were measured using speckle-tracking software applied to archived echocardiographic studies. Conventional echocardiographic and myocardial mechanical parameters were compared among the study subgroups.', 'Patients with asymptomatic severe AS demonstrated smaller reductions in longitudinal strain, higher (supernormal) apical circumferential strain (-38 \u00b1 6% vs -35 \u00b1 4%, P < .05), and extreme (supernormal) apical rotation (12.2 \u00b1 4.9\u00b0 vs 2.9 \u00b1 1.7\u00b0, P < .0005) compared with symptomatic patients.

In Experiment 1, two hundred and forty male broiler chickens were equally allocated into two groups: 1) basal diet (BD), 2) BG diets (BD + BG). Growth performance was compared between treatments for the 41-day trial. In Experiment 2, forty male broiler chickens were equally allocated into two groups. The general experimental design, group and management were the same as described in Experiment 1 except for reduced bird numbers and 21-day duration of the trial. Growth performance, abdominal fat deposition, serum lipid profiles as well as serum and tissue concentrations of key enzymes involved in lipid metabolism were compared between treatments. RNA-seq was employed to identify both differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and treatment specifically expressed genes (TSEGs). Functional clustering of DEGs and TSEGs and signaling pathways associated with lipid metabolism were identified using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) and DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.7 (DAVID-BR). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays were subsequently conducted to further examine the expression of genes in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) signaling pathway identified by DAVID-BR. Dietary BG intervention significantly reduced abdominal fat ratio (abdominal fat weight/final body weight) in broilers. The decreased fat deposition in BG-fed chickens was in accordance with serum lipid profiles as well as the level of lipid metabolism-related enzymes in the serum, abdominal adipose, jejunum and liver. RNA-seq analysis indicated that dietary BG intervention induced 79 and 205 characterized DEGs in the jejunum and liver, respectively. In addition, 255 and 165 TSEGs were detected in the liver and jejunum of BG-fed group, while 162 and 211 TSEGs genes were observed in the liver and jejunum of BD-fed birds, respectively. Bioinformatic analysis with both IPA and DAVID-BR further revealed a significant enrichment of DEGs and TSEGs in the biological processes for reducing the synthesis, storage, transportation and secretion of lipids in the jejunum, while those in the liver were for enhancing the oxidation of ingested lipids and fatty acids.
