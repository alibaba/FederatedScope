I've been moderately comfortable because I have been careful with my money.' \n\nNow the couple have decided to part, Mr Hawken will walk away with just PS1million, but says it will be enough for him. \n\nHe added: 'I have got a settlement which is not great, but it's enough for me because I don't have an extravagant lifestyle. I won't have to work if I'm careful.' \n\nOn a recent trip to China, Mr Hawken said his wife took him on a yacht and treated him to a PS900 bottle of wine, but he prefers his local Wetherspoon pub. \n\n'I'm getting a little pay when you consider her potential wealth, but I don't really want to fight it.' \n\nMr Hawken met Li on a blind date while he was still a teacher and she was studying English. \n\nThe couple married, but as Li's business took off the couple spent more and more time apart. Mr Hawken says the couple have spent most of the relationship apart. \n\nFar from driving them apart, Mr Hawken believes the distance kept them together, and says they would have divorced a long time ago if they were under the same roof. \n\nMr Hawken says his only regret is not getting a divorce sooner, but he didn't push for it over fears it would affect the couple's teenage son William, now 17. \n\nMr Hawken no longer teaches full-time, but instead gives free tuition to under-privileged children.", "output": "Who is separating?, Where are they located?, what town?, How much is the building?", "category": "Question Generation 1534.json"}, {"instruction": "This task is about reading the given passage and construct a question about the information present in the passage.
