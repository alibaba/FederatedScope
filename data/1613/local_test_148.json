The shelf has slots for each item and a retracting panel behind the items to automatically push them forward. They require minimal effort to push back and put an item in, but some customers refuse to do the absolute bare minimum and if the item doesn't magically push in with so little force you couldn't even knock over an empty tin can, they give up entirely.\n\n  \nA woman takes an item, taps it against the shelf with no effort, and puts it down on the shelf below, where it does not belong. I take it and put it back on the shelf.  \n\n\nI step away to stock something else, and I come back. She has another variety of the same item, taps it against the shelf with no effort again, and sets it down on the shelf.  \n\n\nNormally this shit really aggravates me because it's unacceptable laziness on the shopper's part and I consider it incredibly rude to just throw things wherever you like. Especially if I'm standing right there, trying to make the shelf look nice. Just ask if you need help, or put in the effort to put it back.  \n\n\nBut I'm trying lately to be more verbal with customers, I don't usually try to talk to them. A coworker \"messes with\" customers and they usually really go for it. These people seemed nice, so when I put the second one back, I said \"oh, you missed twice! :P\", ribbing the woman for not putting the item on the shelf, twice, and me catching her and correcting her, twice. I say this as I'm taking things to the back.\n\nShe responds \"Yep! \\*\\*Twice!\\*\\*\" in a very fierce way, and I was not looking at her but I imagine she said it with an angry stepford smile and wide eyes. Her husband immediately states behind me \"If you don't like your job, work a different one, asshole!\" which I go wide-eyed at but completely ignore and go hide in the back.\n\n  \nI think I mistook what was really \"I have no respect for other people and don't clean up after myself\" for \"oh gosh I can't get it back on the shelf, silly me\" (even though she clearly wasn't trying), and that's why they got so upset. They were being defensive.   \n\n\nIt's kind of eating at me, though. :( Is it really me who is the asshole to call someone out- even jokingly- on making the store a messier place? I mean, who does that? Just leaves things wherever they want? Do good people do that? I think it's a fair assumption that people who do that so flippantly- as to do it \\*twice\\*, in front of an employee, after already being caught doing it- are not good people, but I figured ribbing them for it might make them laugh and reconsider their behavior.

So we scratched going out and decided on staying home and watching a movie with my little brother to make him happy. I was upset about that bc I wanted to go out, and I don\u2019t ever really like going out my house. I only leave for school.  \n\nAnyways, my sister and I decided on going to ihop and then to the movies to watch Us later tonight. \n\nIt\u2019s already 7:28 and we haven\u2019t done anything. I\u2019ve been in bed all day, my family hasn\u2019t left the house all day, and my aunt and cousin came over. \n\nI wanted to watch this movie over an hour ago with my brother so we can leave and go to ihop and have time to make the 10 o\u2019clock screening. Ihop closes at 11, and I don\u2019t feel like watching a movie in the hood theater at 11:30 because my family can\u2019t leave the house or do anything right. \n\nMy sister just asked me if we have to go to ihop. I want to yell. Because yes I want to fucking  go with her already and have a sister date with her. But no. Can\u2019t go to ihop even tho I\u2019ve been craving it ode. I don\u2019t mean to sound spoiled but, all day I\u2019ve been trying to make plans and none of them happened. None, zip. Zero. \n\nAnd I ask my family a simple question like \u201cdo you want to watch Us with us?\u201d And I either get no answer or a dumbass one that has nothing to do with my question. \n\nSo now apparently we might not even go watch the damn movie. This family is just a huge worthless headache. \n\nSo, do I have the right, and AITA for getting mad at all my families bullshit?
