Then give those of these women you have enjoyed, the agreed dower. It will not be sinful if you agree to something (else) by mutual consent after having settled the dowry. God is certainly all-knowing and all-wise., And all married women are forbidden for you except the wives of disbelievers who come into your possession as bondwomen; this is Allah\u2019s decree for you; and other than these, all women are lawful for you so that you seek them in exchange of your wealth in proper wedlock, not adultery; therefore give the women you wish to marry, their appointed bridal money; and after the appointment (of bridal money) there is no sin on you if you come to a mutual agreement; indeed Allah is All Knowing, Wise., and wedded women, save what your right hands own. So God prescribes for you. Lawful for you, beyond all that, is that you may seek, using your wealth, in wedlock and not in licence. Such wives as you enjoy thereby, give them their wages apportionate; it is no fault in you in your agreeing together, after the due apportionate. God is All-knowing, All-wise., And also forbidden are the wedded among women, save those whom your right hands own Allah's rescript for you. And allowed unto you is whatsoever is beyond that, so that ye may seek them with your substances as properly wedded men, not as fornicators. Then whomsoever of them ye have enjoyed, give them their dowers stipulated. And there will be no blame on you in regard to aught on which ye mutually agree after the stipulation; verily Allah is Knowing, Wise., Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those (captives and slaves) whom your right hands possess. Thus has Allah ordained for you. All others are lawful, provided you seek (them in marriage) with Mahr (bridal money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) from your property, desiring chastity, not committing illegal sexual intercourse, so with those of whom you have enjoyed sexual relations, give them their Mahr as prescribed; but if after a Mahr is prescribed, you agree mutually (to give more), there is no sin on you. Surely, Allah is Ever All-Knowing, All-Wise., And all married women, except those you rightfully possess. This is God\u2019s decree, binding upon you. Permitted for you are those that lie outside these limits, provided you seek them in legal marriage, with gifts from your property, seeking wedlock, not prostitution. If you wish to enjoy them, then give them their dowry\u2014a legal obligation. You commit no error by agreeing to any change to the dowry. God is All-Knowing, Most Wise., And also forbidden to you are all married women (muhsanat) except those women whom your right hands have come to possess (as a result of war). This is Allah's decree and it is binding upon you. But it is lawful for you to seek out all women except these, offering them your wealth and the protection of wedlock rather than using them for the unfettered satisfaction of lust. And in exchange of what you enjoy by marrying them pay their bridal-due as an obligation. But there is no blame on you if you mutually agree to alter the settlement after it has been made. Surely Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise., Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those (slaves) whom your right hands possess. Thus has Allah ordained for you. All others are lawful, provided you seek them (with a dowry) from your property, desiring chastity, not fornication. So with those among them whom you have enjoyed, give them their required due, but if you agree mutually (to give more) after the requirement (has been determined), there is no sin on you.

All this is sinful. Today the unbelievers have lost every hope of (despoiling) your creed; so do not fear them, fear Me.

For it is immoral. Today, those who disbelieve have despaired of your religion, so do not fear them, but fear Me. Today I have perfected your religion for you, and have completed My favor upon you, and have approved Islam as a religion for you. But whoever is compelled by hunger, with no intent of wrongdoing\u2014God is Forgiving and Merciful., Forbidden to you are carrion, blood, the flesh of swine, the animal slaughtered in any name other than Allah's, the animal which has either been strangled, killed by blows, has died of a fall, by goring or that devoured by a beast of prey - unless it be that which you yourselves might have slaughtered while it was still alive - and that which was slaughtered at the altars. - You are also forbidden to seek knowledge of your fate by divining arrows. All these are sinful acts. This day the unbelievers have fully despaired of your religion. Do not fear them; but fear Me. This day I have perfected for you your religion, and have bestowed upon you My bounty in full measure, and have been pleased to assign for you Islam as your religion. (Follow, then, the lawful and unlawful bounds enjoined upon you.) As for he who is driven by hunger, without being wilfully inclined to sin, surely Allah is All-Forgiving, All-Compassionate., Forbidden to you (for food) are: Al-Maytah (the dead animals), blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been slaughtered as a sacrifice for other than Allah, and that which has been killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by the goring of horns \u0640and that which has been (partly) eaten by a wild animal \u0640unless you are able to slaughter it (before its death) - and that which is sacrificed (slaughtered) on An-Nusub (stone altars). (Forbidden) also is to make decisions with Al-Azlam (arrows) (all) that is Fisq (disobedience and sin). This day, those who disbelieved have given up all hope of your religion; so fear them not, but fear Me. This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favor upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion. But as for him who is forced by severe hunger, with no inclination to sin (such can eat these above mentioned animals), then surely, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful., Forbidden to you (for food) are: dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which hath been invoked the name of other than Allah; that which hath been killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by being gored to death; that which hath been (partly) eaten by a wild animal; unless ye are able to slaughter it (in due form); that which is sacrificed on stone (altars); (forbidden) also is the division (of meat) by raffling with arrows: that is impiety. This day have those who reject faith given up all hope of your religion: yet fear them not but fear Me. This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion. But if any is forced by hunger, with no inclination to transgression, Allah is indeed Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.", "category": "Translation 1284.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a sentence from the Quran in Persian, and your task is to translate it into English.", "input": "\u067e\u0633 \u0627\u0645\u0631\u0648\u0632 \u0627\u0648 \u0631\u0627 \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u06cc\u0646\u062c\u0627 \u062d\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u062a\u06af\u0631\u0649 \u0646\u06cc\u0633\u062a.", "output": "That is why he has no friend today,, \u201cSo he does not have any friend here this day.\u201d, therefore he today has not here one loyal friend,, Wherefore for him here this Day there is no friend., So no friend has he here this Day,, So he has no friend here today., Today he has been left here friendless;, So, no friend has he here this Day,, \"So no friend hath he here this Day.", "category": "Translation 1284.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a sentence from the Quran in Persian, and your task is to translate it into English.", "input": "\u0646\u0647\u060c [\u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0686\u0646\u06cc\u0646 \u0646\u06cc\u0633\u062a\u200c] \u0628\u0644\u06a9\u0647 \u06a9\u0633\u0627\u0646\u0649 \u06a9\u0647 \u0633\u062a\u0645 \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0647\u200c\u0627\u0646\u062f\u060c \u0628\u062f\u0648\u0646 \u0647\u06cc\u0686 \u06af\u0648\u0646\u0647 \u062f\u0627\u0646\u0634\u0649 \u0647\u0648\u0633\u0647\u0627\u0649 \u062e\u0648\u062f \u0631\u0627 \u067e\u06cc\u0631\u0648\u0649 \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0647\u200c\u0627\u0646\u062f. \u067e\u0633 \u0622\u0646 \u06a9\u0633 \u0631\u0627 \u06a9\u0647 \u062e\u062f\u0627 \u06af\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0647 \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0647\u060c \u0686\u0647 \u06a9\u0633\u0649 \u0647\u062f\u0627\u06cc\u062a \u0645\u0649\u200c\u06a9\u0646\u062f\u061f \u0648 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u0649 \u0622\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u06cc\u0627\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0646\u0649 \u0646\u062e\u0648\u0627\u0647\u062f \u0628\u0648\u062f.", "output": "And yet the wicked follow their own lusts without understanding.
