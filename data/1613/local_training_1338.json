SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as ``Women, Children, and Infant Tsunami \nVictim Relief Act of 2005''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) More than 150,000 people were killed as a result of the \n        December 26, 2004, tsunami in Southeast Asia and more than \n        5,000,000 have been directly affected.\n            (2) Approximately 150,000 women in the three most affected \n        countries in the region are pregnant, and many are facing \n        complications related to their pregnancies, including trauma-\n        induced miscarriage and the need for urgent medical and \n        nutritional support.\n            (3) The Indonesian Midwife's Association estimates that 30 \n        percent of its 5,500 members died in the tsunami. Under normal \n        conditions, approximately 15 percent of pregnancies in \n        Indonesia require urgent assistance from midwives or doctors to \n        ensure the health and survival of the babies and mothers.\n            (4) In disaster situations, health care systems crumble \n        when they are most needed, especially by pregnant women. \n        Emergency relief tends to focus on providing food and shelter, \n        clearing roads, and maintaining security, to the exclusion of \n        helping women in labor find a safe, clean place to deliver \n        their babies, or on meeting the special nutrition and care \n        needs of such women.\n            (5) Maternity hospitals, women's health clinics, and other \n        infrastructure for providing health services to women, \n        including infrastructure related to providing maternal health \n        assistance, ensuring safe delivery of babies, providing \n        contraceptives and emergency obstetric care, and preventing \n        sexually transmitted diseases, have been destroyed by the \n        tsunami. In Sri Lanka, four of eight maternity clinics on the \n        east coast were destroyed and the other four were greatly \n        damaged. The Galle Teaching Hospital in Galle, Sri Lanka, \n        relocated its 379 patients to another facility on higher \n        ground. Although the hospital lost only one infant in the \n        transition, the new facility has only 70 beds compared with the \n        415 beds the hospital had.\n            (6) Even before the tsunami, one woman died every minute \n        somewhere in the world from complications related to pregnancy. \n        Too often during disaster situations safe blood supplies, \n        equipment for anesthesia, transfusions and caesarean sections, \n        and trained personnel to save those women's lives are \n        unavailable.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``International Arbitration \nEnforcement Act of 1996''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Arbitration is an efficient and flexible dispute \n        resolution mechanism of great benefit to United States persons \n        doing business internationally.\n            (2) In some countries, particularly those with undeveloped \n        or inconsistent judicial systems, international arbitration may \n        be the only fair and reliable dispute resolution mechanism \n        available to United States persons.\n            (3) The usefulness of international arbitration depends in \n        large measure on the commitment of foreign states to enforce \n        foreign arbitral awards pursuant to their accession to, and \n        observance of, the Convention on the Recognition and \n        Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards.\n            (4) United States persons are often without remedies when \n        foreign states violate the Convention by refusing to enforce \n        foreign arbitral awards or by otherwise impairing the ability \n        to collect the awards by improperly delaying their enforcement.\n            (5) It is in the interest of the United States to maintain \n        the reliability of international arbitration, to promote the \n        observance of the Convention, and to protect United States \n        persons from economic injury resulting from violations of the \n        Convention by foreign states.\n            (6) Similarly, it would be unjust to permit a foreign state \n        to be shielded from liability in the United States for the \n        damages suffered by a United States person abroad resulting \n        from a violation of the Convention by the foreign state.\n            (7) It is therefore in the national interest to create a \n        judicial remedy in favor of United States persons injured as a \n        result of a violation of the Convention by a foreign state and \n        to facilitate the execution of any judgment entered in such an \n        action.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to create a civil remedy against foreign \nstates whose violation of the Convention injures United States persons \nby prohibiting the enforcement of foreign arbitral awards entered in \nfavor of such United States persons or by impairing the ability of such \nUnited States persons to collect such awards.\n\nSEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    As used in this Act--\n            (1) Convention.--The term ``Convention'' means the \n        Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign \n        Arbitral Awards, done at New York on June 10, 1958.\n            (2) United states person.--The term ``United States \n        person'' means--\n                    (A) any United States citizen or alien admitted for \n                permanent residence into the United States; and\n                    (B) any corporation, trust, partnership, or other \n                judicial entity which is 50 percent or more \n                beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by \n                individuals described in subparagraph (A).\n            (3) Foreign arbitral award.--The term ``foreign arbitral \n        award'' means any arbitral award to which the Convention \n        applies.\n\nSEC. 5. LIABILITY FOR VIOLATION OF THE CONVENTION.\n\n    (a) Civil Remedy.--(1) Any foreign state that is certified by the \nPresident under subsection (b) to have injured a United States person \nthrough the state's violation of the Convention with respect to a \nforeign arbitral award shall be liable to the United States person for \nmoney damages consisting of--\n            (A) the amount of the foreign arbitral award, plus any \n        interest provided for by the award; and\n            (B) the attorney's fees and costs incurred by the United \n        States person in bringing an action under this Act with respect \n        to such certification.\n    (2) Actions may be brought under paragraph (1) with respect to \narbitral awards entered before, on, or after the date of the enactment \nof this Act.\n    (b) Presidential Certification.--The President may certify an \ninjury to a United States person through a violation of the Convention \nif--\n            (1)(A) a foreign state has failed to enforce a foreign \n        arbitral award entered in favor of that United States person in \n        violation of the state's obligations under the Convention; or\n            (B) a foreign state has impeded, in violation of its \n        obligations under the Convention, the enforcement of a foreign \n        arbitral award entered in favor of that United States person \n        such that the ability of the United States person to collect \n        the award may reasonably be presumed to have been impaired or \n        reduced; and\n            (2) the United States person has exhausted all judicial and \n        administrative remedies in the foreign state in which the \n        arbitral award is sought to be enforced, or the further pursuit \n        of such remedies would reasonably be considered to be futile.\n    (c) Effect of Presidential Certification.--A Presidential \ncertification that a United States person has been injured by a foreign \nstate's violation of the Convention shall, in any action brought under \nthis Act, establish an evidentiary presumption that--\n            (1) the foreign state certified to have violated the \n        Convention has done so; and\n            (2) the damages suffered by the United States person are \n        equivalent to the amount of the award plus interest, if any.\n    (d) Jurisdiction.--(1) Chapter 85 of title 28, United States Code, \nis amended by inserting after section 1331 the following new section:\n``Sec. 1331a.

NATIONAL COMMISSION ON TAX REFORM AND SIMPLIFICATION.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is overly complex, \n        imposes significant burdens on individuals and businesses and \n        the economy, is extremely difficult for the Internal Revenue \n        Service to administer, and is in need of fundamental reform and \n        simplification.\n            (2) Many of the problems encountered by taxpayers in \n        dealing with the Internal Revenue Service could be eliminated \n        or alleviated by fundamental reform and simplification.\n            (3) Recent efforts to simplify or reform the tax laws have \n        not been successful due in part to the difficulty of developing \n        broad-based, nonpartisan support for proposals to make such \n        changes.\n            (4) Many of the problems with the Internal Revenue Service \n        stem from the overly complex tax code the agency is asked to \n        administer.\n    (b) Establishment.--\n            (1) In general.--To carry out the purposes of this section, \n        there is established within the legislative branch a National \n        Commission on Tax Reform and Simplification (in this section \n        referred to as the ``Commission'').\n            (2) Composition.--The Commission shall be composed of 15 \n        members (of which not less than 2 members are from small \n        businesses with less than 50 employees), as follows:\n                    (A) Three members appointed by the President, two \n                from the executive branch of the Government and one \n                from the private sector.\n                    (B) Four members appointed by the majority leader \n                of the Senate, one from Members of the Senate and three \n                from the private sector.\n                    (C) Two members appointed by the minority leader of \n                the Senate, one from Members of the Senate and one from \n                the private sector.\n                    (D) Four members appointed by the Speaker of the \n                House of Representatives, one from Members of the House \n                and three from the private sector.\n                    (E) Two members appointed by the minority leader of \n                the House of Representatives, one from Members of the \n                House and one from the private sector.\n            (3) Chair.--The Commission shall elect a Chair (or two Co-\n        Chairs) from among its members.\n            (4) Meetings, quorums, vacancies.--After its initial \n        meeting, the Commission shall meet upon the call of the Chair \n        (Co-Chairs, if elected) or a majority of its members. Nine \n        members of the Commission shall constitute a quorum. Any \n        vacancy in the Commission shall not affect its powers, but \n        shall be filled in the same manner in which the original \n        appointment was made. Any meeting of the Commission or any \n        subcommittee thereof may be held in executive session to the \n        extent that the Chair (Co-Chairs, if elected) or a majority of \n        the members of the Commission or subcommittee determine \n        appropriate.\n            (5) Continuation of membership.--If--\n                    (A) any individual who appointed a member to the \n                Commission by virtue of holding a position described in \n                paragraph (2) ceases to hold such position before the \n                report of the Commission is submitted under subsection \n                (g); or\n                    (B) a member was appointed to the Commission as a \n                Member of Congress and the member ceases to be a Member \n                of Congress, or was appointed to the Commission because \n                the member was not an officer or employee of any \n                government and later becomes an officer or employee of \n                a government,\n        that member may continue as a member for not longer than the \n        30-day period beginning on the date that such individual ceases \n        to hold such position or such member ceases to be a Member of \n        Congress or becomes such an officer or employee, as the case \n        may be.\n            (6) Appointment;

FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Until recently, women have been excluded from most \n        clinical trials for treatments for cancer, heart disease, and \n        stroke, despite the fact that women react differently from men \n        to many treatments for these and other diseases.\n            (2) Historically, little research money has been devoted to \n        diseases that primarily afflict women, such as osteoporosis, \n        breast cancer, and multiple sclerosis.\n            (3) The American medical education system has not trained \n        physicians and other health care professionals for women's \n        health needs. A major barrier to change is the absence of an \n        appropriate curriculum on women's health. Another barrier to \n        change has been the significant underrepresentation of women in \n        senior ranks of academic medicine. As long as this void in \n        women leaders is allowed to continue, women's health issues \n        will not gain the appropriate attention within the medical \n        community.\n            (4) The establishment of the Office of Research on Women's \n        Health at the National Institutes of Health is vital to \n        addressing the necessary research for diseases and health \n        conditions that affect women. However, there is currently no \n        means by which to translate this new research into improved \n        physician education and patient care.\n            (5) The Federal Government should develop regional \n        education and treatment centers on women's health to \n        disseminate the information made available by the National \n        Institutes of Health and other Federal research efforts in \n        women's health.\n\nSEC. 3.

TO EXPRESS THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING MEDICAID \n              RECONCILIATION LEGISLATION TO BE REPORTED BY A CONFERENCE \n              COMMITTEE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n            (1) The Medicaid program provides essential health care and \n        long-term care services to more than 50,000,000 low-income \n        children, pregnant women, parents, individuals with \n        disabilities, and senior citizens. It is a Federal guarantee \n        that ensures that the most vulnerable will have access to \n        needed medical services.\n            (2) The Medicaid program provides critical access to long-\n        term care and other services for the elderly and individuals \n        living with disabilities, and is the single largest provider of \n        long-term care services. The Medicaid program also pays for \n        personal care and other supportive services that are typically \n        not provided by private health insurance or under the Medicare \n        program, but are necessary to enable individuals with spinal \n        cord injuries, developmental disabilities, neurological \n        degenerative diseases, serious and persistent mental illnesses, \n        HIV/AIDS, and other chronic conditions to remain in the \n        community, to work, and to maintain independence.\n            (3) The Medicaid program supplements the Medicare program \n        for more than 6,000,000 low-income elderly or disabled Medicare \n        beneficiaries, assisting those beneficiaries with their \n        Medicare premiums and co-insurance, wrap-around benefits, and \n        the costs of nursing home care that the Medicare program does \n        not cover. The Medicaid program spent nearly $40,000,000,000 in \n        2002 on services not covered under the Medicare program.\n            (4) The Medicaid program provides health insurance for more \n        than \\1/4\\ of America's children and is the largest purchaser \n        of maternity care, paying for more than \\1/3\\ of all the births \n        in the United States each year. The Medicaid program also \n        provides vital access to care for children with disabilities, \n        covering more than 70 percent of the poor children with \n        disabilities in the United States.\n            (5) Medicaid's benefits for children are comprehensive, \n        including mandatory coverage for Early and Periodic Screening \n        Diagnosis and Treatment benefits covering all medically \n        necessary care. Medicaid ensures that children have the \n        benefits, health services and health care support they need to \n        be fully immunized and that children can secure eyeglasses, \n        dental care, and hearing aids when necessary, and that children \n        have access to comprehensive, regularly scheduled, and as-\n        needed health examinations, as well as preventive \n        interventions, to correct physical and mental conditions that \n        threaten to delay proper growth and development.\n            (6) More than 16,000,000 American women depend on the \n        Medicaid program for their health care. Women comprise the \n        majority of seniors (71 percent) on Medicaid. Half of \n        nonelderly women with permanent mental or physical disabilities \n        have health care coverage under the Medicaid program. The \n        Medicaid program also provides critical access to treatment for \n        low-income women diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer.\n            (7) The Medicaid program is the Nation's largest source of \n        payment for mental health services, HIV/AIDS care, and care for \n        children with special needs. Much of this care is either not \n        covered by private insurance or is limited in scope or \n        duration. The Medicaid program is also a critical source of \n        funding for health care for children in foster care and for \n        health care services provided in schools.\n            (8) Funds under the Medicaid program help to ensure access \n        to care for all Americans. The Medicaid program is the single \n        largest source of revenue for the Nation's safety net \n        hospitals, health centers, and nursing homes, and is critical \n        to the ability of these providers to adequately serve all \n        Americans.\n            (9) The Medicaid program serves a major role in ensuring \n        that the number of Americans without health insurance, \n        approximately 45,000,000 in 2003, is not substantially higher. \n        The system of Federal matching for State Medicaid expenditures \n        ensures that Federal funds will grow as State spending \n        increases in response to unmet needs, enabling the Medicaid \n        program to help buffer the drop in private coverage during \n        recessions. More than 4,800,000 Americans lost employer-\n        sponsored health care coverage between 2000 and 2003, during \n        which time the Medicaid program enrolled an additional \n        8,400,000 Americans.\n            (10) Many individuals living below the Federal poverty \n        level are ineligible for Medicaid because of stringent income \n        eligibility rules. For parents, eligibility levels are often \n        very far below the Federal poverty level. On average, a working \n        parent in a family of three would have to make less than $224 \n        per week and a non-working parent in a family of three would \n        have to make less than $150 per week to qualify. Single \n        individuals with disabilities would be ineligible if they have \n        more than $147 per week in income.\n            (11) Eligibility levels for pregnant women and children are \n        generally at or just above the Federal poverty level, but a \n        family with income just over minimum wage can be disqualified \n        for Medicaid. At the minimum eligibility levels for pregnant \n        women, earning as little as $8.80 per hour at a full-time job \n        could disqualify a pregnant woman from Medicaid eligibility. A \n        working parent in a family of three earning less than $8.40 per \n        hour at a full-time job could make their child 6 years-old or \n        older ineligible for Medicaid.\n            (12) Title III of the budget reconciliation bill of the \n        House of Representatives, as reported out by the Committee on \n        Energy and Commerce, would adversely affect these low-income \n        beneficiaries, many of whom are children or have special health \n        care needs, by increasing beneficiary cost-sharing, limiting \n        access to benefits, and restricting eligibility for long-term \n        care services that the Medicaid program covers. These new \n        limits make up \\2/3\\ of the House of Representative's projected \n        Medicaid spending reductions, accounting for $30,100,000,000 of \n        the total $45,300,000,000 in Medicaid reductions over 10 years.\n            (13) Making beneficiaries pay more for more limited \n        benefits under Medicaid may put a significant financial burden \n        on these very low-income individuals. Research also \n        demonstrates that increasing beneficiary cost-sharing can make \n        prescription drugs and other essential health services \n        unaffordable for beneficiaries, can cause the health of \n        children and adults to deteriorate, and can lead to higher \n        emergency room and hospital costs.\n            (14) By contrast, while S. 1932, as passed by the Senate on \n        November 3, 2005, includes substantial cuts to the Medicaid \n        program, it does not include direct limits on beneficiary \n        access to Medicaid services. Even so, enactment of S. 1932 \n        would result in a net Medicaid cut of $14,200,000,000 over 10 \n        years, less than \\1/3\\ of the projected Medicaid reductions \n        contained in the House of Representative's budget \n        reconciliation bill.\n    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the \nconferees for any budget reconciliation bill of the 109th Congress \nshall not report a reconciliation bill that would--\n            (1) with respect to low-income children, pregnant women, \n        disabled individuals, elderly individuals, individuals with \n        chronic illnesses like HIV/AIDS, cancer, and diabetes, \n        individuals with mental illnesses, and other Medicaid \n        beneficiaries--\n                    (A) impair access to Medicaid services;\n                    (B) undermine eligibility for such Medicaid \n                beneficiaries;\n                    (C) make Medicaid services unavailable by making \n                them unaffordable to such Medicaid beneficiaries; or\n                    (D) cut health care services for such Medicaid \n                beneficiaries; or\n            (2) undermine the Federal guarantee of health insurance \n        coverage that the Medicaid program provides, which would \n        threaten not only the health care safety net of the United \n        States, but the entire health care system of the United States.", "output": "Expresses the sense of the Senate that the conferees for any budget reconciliation bill of the 109th Congress shall not report a reconciliation bill that would with respect to low-income children, pregnant women, disabled individuals, elderly individuals, individuals with chronic illnesses like HIV/AIDS, cancer, and diabetes, individuals with mental illnesses, and other Medicaid beneficiaries: (1) impair access to Medicaid services; (2) undermine eligibility for such beneficiaries; (3) make Medicaid services unaffordable, hence unavailable, to them; or (4) cut health care services them.\n\n Expresses the sense of the Senate, also, that the conferees shall not report a reconciliation bill that would undermine the federal guarantee of health insurance coverage that the Medicaid program provides, which would threaten not only the health care safety net of the United States, but the entire health care system of the United States.", "category": "Summarization 751.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given text for US Congressional and California state bills, your task is to generate a summary for this bill.", "input": "SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Breast Implant Research and \nInformation Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) According to the Institute of Medicine, it is estimated \n        that 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 American women have received breast \n        implants over the last 35 years. Because there has never been a \n        patient registry for breast implant recipients it is impossible \n        to more accurately determine the number of women who have \n        received breast implants. Yet, the American Society of Plastic \n        Surgeons estimates that in 1999 alone 82,975 women had breast \n        reconstruction following mastectomies and another 167,318 \n        American women received breast implants for cosmetic purposes.\n            (2) From 1985 until January 2000, FDA received 127,770 \n        adverse reaction reports for silicone gel-filled breast \n        implants and 65,720 adverse reaction reports for saline-filled \n        implants.\n            (3) Women need complete and accurate information about the \n        potential health risks and advantages of breast implants so \n        that women can make informed decisions.\n            (4) Silicone breast implants have never been approved by \n        the Food and Drug Administration; saline breast implants, which \n        consist of a saline solution injected into a silicone envelope, \n        were approved by the agency in 2000 despite alarmingly high \n        complication and reoperation rates. After three years, 43 \n        percent of the augmentation patients and 73 percent of the \n        reconstruction patients experienced local complications and 40 \n        percent of the reconstruction patients were forced to undergo \n        additional surgery for local complications and device failure.\n            (5) In 1998, the Food and Drug Administration opened a \n        criminal investigation following allegations that one of the \n        breast implant manufacturers was manipulating research data in \n        breast implant studies. When the Food and Drug Administration's \n        General and Plastic Surgery Devices Panel convened in March \n        2000 to consider market approval for saline implants, it was \n        not informed of the investigation. Although the manufacturer's \n        saline breast implant was approved by the Food and Drug \n        Administration in May 2000, the investigation remains open.\n            (6) According to a 1997 Mayo Clinic study, within 5 years \n        of receiving such implants, 1 in 4 women required additional \n        surgery.\n            (7) In 2000, research sponsored by the Food and Drug \n        Administration found that even among women who had not sought \n        medical treatment for implant problems, almost 70 percent had \n        at least one ruptured implant after 10 to 15 years. Silicone \n        was found to be migrating away from the implants in 21 percent \n        of those women. The FDA researchers concluded that ``the \n        relationship of free silicone to development or progression of \n        disease is unknown''.\n            (8) A 1993 study by Dr. Suzanne S. Teuber et al., \n        University of California, published in The Journal of \n        Autoimmunity, investigated the influence of silicone breast \n        implants on the expression of anticollagen antibodies and found \n        a statistically significant incidence of anticollagen \n        antibodies in women with implants. The researchers concluded \n        that silicone breast implants should not be considered a benign \n        or immunologically inert material; serious implications may \n        result from their use.\n            (9) The Institute of Medicine's 1999 study of silicone \n        breast implant safety found that local complications with \n        silicone breast implants were the primary safety issue, that \n        they have not been well studied, and that information on these \n        complications is crucial for women deciding whether or not they \n        want breast implant surgery. Concern remains that exposure to \n        silicone breast implants may result in currently undefined \n        connective tissue or autoimmune diseases.\n            (10) A 2001 National Cancer Institute study found breast \n        implant recipients suffer from higher rates of lung and brain \n        cancer than other plastic surgery patients.\n            (11) A 1999 case report by Dr. Suzanne S. Teuber et al., \n        University of California, published in The Journal of \n        Rheumatology, found evidence of silicone migration in women \n        with ruptured or leaking silicone breast implants. These \n        patients experienced severe local inflammation and \n        complications resulting from silicone migration to the axilla, \n        arm or abdominal wall. Researchers concluded that once silicone \n        gel leaves the implant, it is not biologically inert and in \n        some persons can elicit profound pathologic responses.\n            (12) According to many reports, including a study published \n        in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, the presence \n        of a silicone breast implant may create difficulties in \n        obtaining accurate and thorough mammograms because as much as \n        40 percent of the breast tissue can be masked by the implant. \n        This delays the early detection of breast cancer in women.\n            (13) According to a 2000 Food and Drug Administration \n        publication, women of childbearing age who want to breast feed \n        should be aware of the negative impact of breast implants on \n        breast feeding. It is not known if a small amount of silicone \n        may pass from the silicone shell of an implant into breast \n        milk. If this occurs, it is not known what effect it may have \n        on the nursing infant.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to promote research to \nidentify and evaluate the health effects of breast implants, to ensure \nthat women receive accurate information about such implants and to \nencourage the Food and Drug Administration to conclude its criminal \ninvestigation based on the allegations of wrong-doing by one of the \nimplant manufacturers which ultimately may affect their products and \nthe health of American women.\n    (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed \nto affect any rule or regulation promulgated under the authority of the \nFederal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S. 301 et seq.) that is in \neffect on the date of enactment of this Act relating to the \navailability of silicone breast implant for reconstruction after \nmastectomy, correction of congenital deformities, or replacement for \nruptured silicone implants for augmentation.\n\nSEC. 3.

We recognize that no small share of the American burden \n        will fall on the shoulders of the Federal Government and on \n        State and local governments.\n            (d) Six issues need to be addressed:\n                    (1) An analysis of the history and background \n                concerning the reasons for the occurance of the Year \n                2000 problem.\n                    (2) The cost of reviewing and rewriting codes for \n                both the Federal and State Governments over the next \n                three years, including a legal analysis of \n                responsibilities for such costs and possible equitable \n                bases for sharing them.\n                    (3) The time it will take to get the job done and, \n                if not by 2000, what agencies are at risk of not being \n                able to perform basic services.\n                    (4) The development of balanced and sound contracts \n                with the computer industry available for use by Federal \n                agencies, and if such outside contractual assistance is \n                needed, to assist such agencies in contracting for and \n                effectuating Year 2000 compliance for current computer \n                programs and systems as well to ensure Year 2000 \n                compliance for all programs and systems acquired in the \n                future.\n                    (5) An analysis of what happens to the United \n                States economy if the problem is not resolved by mid-\n                1999.\n                    (6) Recommendations to the President and the \n                Congress concerning lessons to be learned and policies \n                and actions to be taken in the future to minimize the \n                Year 2000 public and private sector costs and risks.\n            (e) The Congress recognizes that an Executive Branch \n        Interagency Committee has been established to raise awareness \n        of this problem and facilitate efforts at solving it; but that \n        in order to best minimize the impact and cost of this problem, \n        and recognizing the extreme urgency of this problem, this \n        bipartisan commission will be established to both address these \n        issues and take responsibility for assuring that all Federal \n        agencies be computer compliant by January 1, 1999.\n\nSEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMISSION.\n\n    (a) There is established a commission to be known as the ``National \nCommission on the Year 2000 Computer Problem'' (hereinafter in this \nsection referred to as the ``Commission'').

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Afghanistan Freedom Act of 2001''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The rise to power of the Taliban in Afghanistan has \n        caused a drastic decline in the human, political, and civil \n        rights of the Afghan people, particularly among women, girls, \n        and ethnic minorities.\n            (2) In the year 2001, millions of Afghans are on the verge \n        of starvation, the largest such group in the world.\n            (3) The United States is the single largest donor of \n        humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan, totaling more than \n        $185,000,000 in fiscal year 2001.\n            (4) There are approximately 2,000,000 Afghan refugees in \n        Pakistan, 1,500,000 Afghan refugees in Iran, and 1,000,000 \n        internally displaced persons in Afghanistan, most fleeing \n        oppression, violence, and economic hardship.\n            (5) During the period of Taliban rule, Afghanistan has \n        become the world's largest source of illegal opium, and \n        proceeds from the sale of raw opium to drug traffickers are \n        used by the Taliban to finance its war on the Afghan people.\n            (6) Under Taliban rule, Afghanistan has become a training \n        ground, operational base, and safe haven for terrorists and \n        international terrorist organizations, many of whom gain \n        experience fighting alongside Taliban forces inside Afghanistan \n        prior to conducting terrorist operations outside Afghanistan.\n            (7) The Taliban have, since 1996, harbored and protected \n        terrorist leader Osama bin Laden and members of his terrorist \n        al Qaeda network.\n            (8) Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda associates were \n        indicted for the August 7, 1998, bombings of the United States \n        embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, as a \n        result of which the United Nations Security Council adopted \n        Resolution 1267 (1999), demanding that the Taliban surrender \n        Osama bin Laden for trial and determining that the Taliban's \n        continued provision of sanctuary to international terrorist \n        organizations constitutes a threat to international peace and \n        security.\n            (9) In order to compel the Taliban to surrender Osama bin \n        Laden and terminate support for international terrorist \n        organizations, the United Nations Security Council has imposed \n        progressively more comprehensive sanctions on the Taliban under \n        Resolutions 1267 (1999), 1333 (2000), and 1363 (2001), which \n        sanctions are binding on all members of the United Nations \n        under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.\n            (10) As a result of the Taliban's failure to comply with \n        the demands of the United States and the United Nations \n        Security Council, Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda network were \n        able to orchestrate from Afghanistan the September 11, 2001, \n        terrorist attack on the United States in which approximately \n        6,000 Americans and foreign nationals were murdered.\n            (11) The Taliban have, since the September 11th attack on \n        the United States, rejected all entreaties by the United States \n        and other governments to surrender Osama bin Laden, close down \n        international terrorist operations in Afghanistan, and comply \n        with the other demands that have been made by the United \n        Nations Security Council.\n            (12) Afghanistan is an ethnically diverse nation that can \n        prosper only under a representative government that affords all \n        citizens of that nation their basic human rights, restores \n        peace and security, eradicates the drug trade, and brings all \n        terrorists and terrorist organizations in Afghanistan to \n        justice.\n\nSEC. 3. UNITED STATES POLICY TOWARD AFGHANISTAN.\n\n    It shall be the policy of the United States to promote the removal \nfrom power of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan so as to diminish the \nrisk of future terrorist attack on the United States and restore basic \nhuman freedoms to the people of Afghanistan.\n\nSEC. 4.

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Article I, section 9, of the United States Constitution \n        makes Congress responsible for all money drawn from the United \n        States Treasury.\n            (2) The United States national debt now exceeds \n        $12,600,000,000,000.\n            (3) The Federal budget deficit is projected to amount to \n        $1,300,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2010 and the annual deficits \n        will average nearly $1,000,000,000,000 for the next decade, \n        according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n            (4) Each American's share of the United States national \n        debt amounts to more than $41,000.\n            (5) The United States national debt increases more than \n        $4,000,000,000 each day.\n            (6) Foreign investors held 48 percent of the United States' \n        outstanding public debt at the end of 2009, including \n        $776,400,000,000 the United States owes to Communist China.\n            (7) For the first time ever, the Federal budget deficit has \n        been singled out as the most important issue facing the future \n        of the country, according to a Gallup poll conducted between \n        March 4 and March 7, 2010.\n            (8) Eighty-three percent of Americans say the size of the \n        Federal budget deficit is due to the unwillingness of \n        politicians to cut Government spending and just 11 percent \n        think the Government spends taxpayers' money wisely, according \n        to a national survey conducted between February 2 and February \n        3, 2010, by Rasmussen Reports.\n            (9) More than twice as many United States adults (58 \n        percent) say that debt owed to China is a more serious threat \n        to the long-term security and well-being of the United States \n        than is terrorism from radical Islamic terrorists (27 percent), \n        according to a Zogby Interactive survey conducted between \n        February 17 and February 19, 2010.\n            (10) For the reasons specified in paragraphs (1) through \n        (9)--\n                    (A) Congress should make balancing the Federal \n                budget an urgent priority to protect the national \n                security, financial stability, and standard of living \n                of the United States;\n                    (B) because Congress has long refused to make the \n                tough decisions necessary to cut wasteful spending, \n                reducing the national debt limit is the only sure way \n                to force Congress to live within its means; and\n                    (C) the pay for members of Congress, who are \n                constitutionally responsible for the money drawn from \n                the United States Treasury and the debt that results \n                from excessive spending, should not be increased until \n                Congress has balanced the Federal budget.\n\nSEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n    Congress finds the following:\n        (1) The First Special Service Force (the ``Force''), a military \n    unit composed of volunteers from the United States and Canada, was \n    activated in July 1942 at Fort Harrison near Helena, Montana.\n        (2) The Force was initially intended to target military and \n    industrial installations that were supporting the German war \n    effort, including important hydroelectric plants, which would \n    severely limit the production of strategic materials used by the \n    Axis powers.\n        (3) From July 1942 through June 1943, volunteers of the Force \n    trained in hazardous, arctic conditions in the mountains of western \n    Montana, and in the waterways of Camp Bradford, Virginia.\n        (4) The combat echelon of the Force totaled 1,800 soldiers, \n    half from the United States and half from Canada.\n        (5) The Force also contained a service battalion, composed of \n    800 members from the United States, that provided important support \n    for the combat troops.\n        (6) A special bond developed between the Canadian and United \n    States soldiers, who were not segregated by country, although the \n    commander of the Force was a United States colonel.\n        (7) The Force was the only unit formed during World War II that \n    consisted of troops from Canada and the United States.\n        (8) In October 1943, the Force went to Italy, where it fought \n    in battles south of Cassino, including Monte La Difensa and Monte \n    Majo, two mountain peaks that were a critical anchor of the German \n    defense line.\n        (9) During the night of December 3, 1943, the Force ascended to \n    the top of the precipitous face of Monte La Difensa, where the \n    Force suffered heavy casualties and overcame fierce resistance to \n    overtake the German line.\n        (10) After the battle for La Difensa, the Force continued to \n    fight tough battles at high altitudes, in rugged terrain, and in \n    severe weather.\n        (11) After battles on the strongly defended Italian peaks of \n    Sammucro, Vischiataro, and Remetanea, the size of the Force had \n    been reduced from 1,800 soldiers to fewer than 500.\n        (12) For 4 months in 1944, the Force engaged in raids and \n    aggressive patrols at the Anzio Beachhead.\n        (13) On June 4, 1944, members of the Force were among the first \n    Allied troops to liberate Rome.\n        (14) After liberating Rome, the Force moved to southern Italy \n    and prepared to assist in the liberation of France.\n        (15) During the early morning of August 15, 1944, members of \n    the Force made silent landings on Les Iles D'Hyeres, small islands \n    in the Mediterranean Sea along the southern coast of France.\n        (16) The Force faced a sustained and withering assault from the \n    German garrisons as the Force progressed from the islands to the \n    Franco-Italian border.\n        (17) After the Allied forces secured the Franco-Italian border, \n    the United States Army ordered the disbandment of the Force on \n    December 5, 1944, in Nice, France.\n        (18) During 251 days of combat, the Force suffered 2,314 \n    casualties, or 134 percent of its authorized strength, captured \n    thousands of prisoners, won 5 United States campaign stars and 8 \n    Canadian battle honors, and never failed a mission.\n        (19) The United States is forever indebted to the acts of \n    bravery and selflessness of the troops of the Force, who risked \n    their lives for the cause of freedom.\n        (20) The efforts of the Force along the seas and skies of \n    Europe were critical in repelling the advance of Nazi Germany and \n    liberating numerous communities in France and Italy.\n        (21) The bond between the members of the Force from the United \n    States and those from Canada has endured over the decades, as the \n    members meet every year for a reunion, alternating between the \n    United States and Canada.\n        (22) The traditions and honors exhibited by the Force are \n    carried on by 2 outstanding active units of 2 great democracies, \n    the Special Forces of the United States and the Canadian Special \n    Operations Regiment.\nSEC. 2.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Broadband for First Responders Act \nof 2010''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The communications capabilities of first responders and \n        other public safety agencies directly affect the public safety \n        of the people of the United States and our national security.\n            (2) As events such as the terrorist attacks of September \n        11, 2001, and Hurricane Katrina revealed, the inability of \n        local, State, tribal, and Federal first responders to \n        communicate effectively during an emergency impairs operations \n        and the ability to mitigate terrorist acts and natural \n        disasters.\n            (3) Many public safety communications systems rely on \n        commercially available systems that lack broadband capabilities \n        or otherwise fail to provide the level of service necessary to \n        meet the mission-critical needs of public safety agencies.\n            (4) A wireless public safety broadband network is needed to \n        guarantee priority access for public safety use and first \n        responder interoperability across the United States.\n            (5) Allocating the paired electromagnetic spectrum bands of \n        758-763 megahertz and 788-793 megahertz, referred to as the D \n        Block, to public safety agencies is the only assured way of \n        meeting public safety's needs for sufficient spectrum and would \n        help reduce the complexity and future operating cost of public \n        safety communications systems.\n            (6) Because the communications needs of public safety \n        agencies may differ by geographic region (including whether \n        they require a dedicated communications system or can rely on a \n        system shared with commercial users), each region requires \n        flexibility to develop a model that meets its needs without \n        sacrificing the interoperability of the system as a whole.\n            (7) The most timely and cost-effective way to achieve \n        nationwide interoperability in public safety communications \n        will be to leverage commercial infrastructure without \n        compromising the mission-critical needs of public safety \n        agencies.\n            (8) The use by public safety agencies of standardized \n        technologies commonly employed in the commercial \n        telecommunications sector will provide significant benefits, \n        including improved capabilities, greater economies of scale, \n        and more rapid adoption of technological innovations.\n            (9) When it is in the interest of public safety, the \n        Federal Communications Commission should encourage any public \n        safety licensee or spectrum lessee to consider using existing \n        or planned commercial infrastructure.\n\nSEC. 3.

Whether because of a lack of knowledge of Spanish \n        land law on the part of the judicial system in the then new \n        Territory of New Mexico, whether because of inadequate or \n        conflicting documentation of these claims, or whether it was \n        due to sharp legal practices, many of the former citizens of \n        Mexico, and then new citizens of the United States, lost title \n        to lands that had been guaranteed to them by treaty.\n            (4) Following the United States war with Mexico, the \n        economy of the Territory of New Mexico was dependent on the use \n        of land resources, and that held true for much of this century \n        as well. When the land grant claimants lost title to their \n        land, the predominantly Hispanic communities in northern New \n        Mexico lost a keystone to their economy. The effects of this \n        loss have had long lasting economic consequences and are in \n        part the cause that these communities remain some of the \n        poorest in the United States.\n            (5) The history of the implementation of the Treaty of \n        Guadalupe-Hidalgo has been a source of continuing controversy \n        for generations and has left a lingering sense of injustice in \n        the communities in northern New Mexico, which has periodically \n        led to armed conflicts.\n            (6) The Government of the United States has an obligation \n        to try to find an equitable remedy for the inadequate \n        implementation of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo and the \n        consequences that has had on the communities and people of New \n        Mexico. This should be done as expeditiously as possible. \n        However, reconstructing the one hundred and fifty year history \n        of land title claims and transfers in these communities is \n        likely to prove lengthy and costly. In some cases it may never \n        be possible to adequately reconstruct the title history.\n            (7) The Secretary of the Interior has had an experience in \n        administratively developing settlement packages to resolve \n        large and complex Tribal water rights claims as an alternative \n        to lengthy and expensive litigation. This experience may be \n        invaluable in resolving the large, complex, and sometimes \n        conflicting Spanish and Mexican land grant claims in northern \n        New Mexico.\n            (8) The history of colonial Spanish America, the system of \n        land distribution under Spanish and Mexican law, and the \n        subsequent impacts to that system following the transfer of \n        territory from Mexico to the United States under the Treaty of \n        Guadalupe-Hidalgo is a requisite body of knowledge in \n        determining an appropriate settlement of land grant claims. It \n        is also an integral part of the national history and culture of \n        the United States of America and, as such, deserves formal \nrecognition and interpretation by our institutions of historical \npreservation.\n\nSEC. 3. CREATION OF SETTLEMENT COMMITTEES.\n\n    (a) Within one hundred and eighty (180) days of enactment of this \nAct, the Secretary of the Interior working through the Bureau of Land \nManagement and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the Secretary of \nAgriculture working through the Forest Service are hereby authorized \nand directed to establish a ``Settlement Committee'' to develop \ncomprehensive settlements for land grant claims on a county by county \nbasis.\n    (b) The Settlement Committee will be comprised of separate \nsubcommittees for each county in which there are land grant claims in \nNew Mexico.\n    (c) Each county subcommittee shall by comprised of seven members \nincluding:\n            (1) a representative of the Secretary of the Interior;\n            (2) a representative of the Secretary of Agriculture;\n            (3) a representative of the State Commissioner of Public \n        Lands; and\n            (4) four residents of the particular county in question. \n        The four county representatives are to be appointed their \n        county commissions: Provided, That in counties with federally \n        recognized Native American Indian Tribes that at least one \n        county representative shall be an enrolled member of a tribe \n        whose reservation pueblo boundaries come within that county: \n        Provided further, That at least one county representative shall \n        be an eligible descendent who is not an enrolled member of a \n        Native American Indian Tribe.\n    (d) Each member shall be appointed for the life of the Settlement \nCommittee. A vacancy in the Settlement Committee shall be filled in the \nmanner in which the original appointment was made.\n\nSEC. 4.

In creating the settlement package, the \nsettlement committee shall take into account: the degree of certainty \nwith which it has determined that various claims are valid, the \nimpacts, including economic and social impacts, that any unfulfilled \nland grant claims may have had on the communities within that county, \nthe relative benefits of various settlement options on those \ncommunities, and whether there is a legal entity that can accept \nsettlement. The elements of a proposed settlement package may include, \nbut are not limited to:\n            (1) restoration of lands to a given land grant community or \n        communities;\n            (2) reconstitution of a given land grant community or \n        communities;\n            (3) the setting aside of certain lands for communal use for \n        fuel wood, building materials, hunting, recreation, etc. These \n        lands could be set aside as special managerial units within \n        existing Federal land management agencies or transferred to \n        local county, tribal, or municipal, governments;\n            (4) trust funds for scholarships or home and business \n        loans; or\n            (5) land for commercial use with the proceeds to be \n        deposited into the trust funds.\n    (c) The settlement committee shall complete its review and proposed \nsettlement package within three years of the deadline for submission of \nland grant claims under this Act, and submit them in a report to the \nSenate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the Senate \nCommittee on Indian Affairs, and to the House Resources Committee.

ADMINISTRATION OF THE SETTLEMENT COMMITTEE.\n\n    (a) To complete its tasks the settlement committee may use a \nvariety of methods to gather information and to build community \nconsensus on the form of a proposed settlement package, including: the \nuse of town meetings, holding formal hearings, the solicitation of \nwritten comments, and the use of mediators trained in alternative \ndispute resolution methods. The settlement committee is also authorized \nto hire consultants as it may choose for historical, economic, and \nlegal analysis. In its efforts to develop a consensus on a settlement \npackage, the Settlement Committee is not subject to the Federal \nAdvisory Committee Act (Public Law 92-462; 5 U.S.C. Ap. 2 Sec. 1).\n    (b) Gifts, Bequests, and Devises.--The Settlement Committee may \naccept, use, and dispose of gifts, bequests, or devises of services or \nproperty, both real and personal, for the purpose of aiding or \nfacilitating the work of the Settlement Committee.

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The development of science and technology has been a \n        core mission of the Air Force since its inception as an \n        independent service.\n            (2) From fiscal year 1989 to fiscal year 2001, spending on \n        Air Force science and technology programs dropped \n        significantly, from $2,720,000,000 to $1,460,000,000 when \n        measured in constant fiscal year 2001 dollars and from 2.2 \n        percent to 1.7 percent when measured as a percentage of the \n        total obligational authority of the Air Force.\n            (3) In recent years, the focus of Air Force science and \n        technology has shifted to include a smaller percentage of long-\n        term, revolutionary projects with the promise of significant \n        payoff and a higher percentage of short-term projects with the \n        possibility only of incremental technology advances.\n            (4) The steep decline over the last decade in spending on \n        Air Force science and technology programs and the absence of \n        long-term science and technology planning are the result of \n        factors including:\n                    (A) The Air Force organization has not included, at \n                a sufficiently high level, a single official with clear \n                responsibility for advocating the development of \n                science and technology.\n                    (B) The science and technology program has had \n                inadequate visibility at the highest levels of Air \n                Force decisionmaking.\n                    (C) The Air Force does not have a planning process \n                that clearly links long-term warfighting requirements \n                with planning for science and technology development \n                within the budget planning process.\n                    (D) The methodologies used to determine the overall \n                budgetary requirements for Air Force science and \n                technology programs and to prioritize among those \n                programs are ineffective.\n            (5) The decline in Air Force science and technology \n        development will likely diminish national security in the \n        future, because important technologies may be unavailable to be \n        incorporated into weapon systems.\n            (6) In recent years, Congress has made efforts to reverse \n        the decline in Air Force science and technology development by \n        appropriating greater amounts for such development than \n        requested in the budget submitted by the President.\n            (7) The Air Force is in the process of making fundamental \n        changes in how it makes budgetary and nonbudgetary policy \n        decisions with respect to its science and technology \n        development programs and how it carries out those programs.\n            (8) The Air Force has made a significant effort over the \n        past two years to increase the emphasis on science and \n        technology development by senior-level decisionmakers through \n        the use of science and technology summits, applied technology \n        councils, and a new advocacy process for science and \n        technology.\n            (9) The Secretary of the Air Force has designated the \n        commander of the Air Force Materiel Command with the grade of \n        general as the budget advocate for science and technology \n        programs.\n            (10) The Secretary of the Air Force has implemented a new \n        planning process for science and technology development that is \n        linked to the Air Force Strategic Plan.\n            (11) The Air Force is, in a good faith effort, conducting a \n        comprehensive review of the long-term challenges and short-term \n        objectives of the Air Force science and technology programs, as \n        specified in section 252 of the Floyd D. Spence National \n        Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (as enacted by \n        Public Law 106-398; 114 Stat. 1654A-46).\n            (12) Despite the recent Air Force efforts, additional \n        measures are needed to ensure that advocacy for Air Force \n        science and technology development is at its highest and that \n        planning and technology investment prioritization is at its \n        best.\n\nSEC. 3.

From 1889 to 1890 he served \n        at Fort Robinson, Nebraska, and from 1890 to 1894 at Fort \n        Duchesne, Utah.\n            (4) In 1894, Lieutenant Young was assigned to Wilberforce \n        College in Ohio, a historically black college (HBCU), to lead \n        the new military sciences department, established under a \n        special Federal grant.\n            (5) As the commander of an Army unit assigned to protect \n        and develop Sequoia National Park and General Grant National \n        Park in the State of California, Colonel Young is recognized as \n        the first African-American to be the Superintendent of a \n        National Park.\n            (6) During his 32 years of honorable military service, \n        Colonel Young proved to be a valuable asset in the field of \n        military intelligence.\n            (7) With the Army's founding of the Military Intelligence \n        Department, in 1904 it assigned Young as one of the first \n        military attaches, serving in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.\n            (8) In 1908 Young was sent to the Philippines to join his \n        Ninth Regiment and command a squadron of two troops. It was his \n        second tour there. After his return to the United States, he \n        served for 2 years at Fort D.A. Russell, Wyoming.\n            (9) In 1912 Young was assigned as the military attache to \n        Liberia, the first African-American to hold that post. For 3 \n        years, he served as an expert adviser to the Liberian \n        government and also took a direct role, supervising \n        construction of the country's infrastructure.\n            (10) In 1912 Young published The Military Morale of Nations \n        and Races, a remarkably prescient study of the cultural sources \n        of military power.\n            (11) During the 1916 Punitive Expedition by the United \n        States into Mexico, then-Major Young commanded the 2nd squadron \n        of the 10th United States Cavalry. While leading a cavalry \n        pistol charge against Pancho Villa's forces at Agua Caliente, \n        he routed the opposing forces without losing a single man.\n            (12) Because of his exceptional leadership of the 10th \n        Cavalry in the Mexican theater of war, Young was promoted to \n        Lieutenant Colonel in September 1916. He was assigned as \n        commander of Fort Huachuca, the base in Arizona of the Tenth \n        Cavalry, nicknamed the ``Buffalo Soldiers'', until mid-1917. He \n        was the first African-American to achieve the rank of colonel \n        in the United States Army.\n\nSEC. 3.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) more than 35 percent of families in the northeastern \n        United States depend on oil to heat their homes each winter, \n        and most of those families have no practical alternative to \n        paying the going price for heating oil or seeking public or \n        private assistance to pay for heating oil;\n            (2) consumers experienced sudden and dramatic increases in \n        prices for home heating oil during the winters of 1989, 1996, \n        and 1999, causing hardship to families and other people of the \n        United States, including people on fixed and low incomes, \n        people living in rural areas, the elderly, farmers, truckers \n        and the driving public, and governments that pay home heating \n        oil bills;\n            (3) a substantial part of each sudden increase in home \n        heating oil prices has been caused by vastly inadequate \n        supplies of home heating oil accumulated during the summer, \n        fall, and winter months by importers, refiners, and \n        wholesalers; and\n            (4) increased stability in home heating oil prices is \n        necessary to maintain the economic vitality of the Northeast.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to ensure that minimally \nadequate stocks of home heating oil are accumulated in the Northeast to \nmeet reasonably foreseeable demand during each winter while protecting \nconsumers from sudden increases in the price of home heating oil.\n\nSEC. 3.

The Secretary shall give \nspecial consideration to themes, sites, and resources not already \nadequately represented in the National Park System as identified in the \nNational Park System Plan to be developed under section 101 of the \nNational Park System Reform Act of 1994. No study of the potential of \nan area for inclusion in the National Park System may be initiated \nafter the date of enactment of this section, except as provided by \nspecific authorization of an Act of Congress. Nothing in this Act shall \nlimit the authority of the National Park Service to conduct preliminary \nresource assessments, gather data on potential study areas, provide \ntechnical and planning assistance, prepare or process nominations for \nadministrative designations, update previous studies, or complete \nreconnaissance surveys of individual areas requiring a total \nexpenditure of less than $25,000.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n     This Act may be cited as the ``Children's Mental Health Screening \nand Prevention Act of 2002''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n     The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Over the past 20 years, advances in scientific research \n        have changed the way of thinking about children's mental health \n        and proven that the same mental disorders that afflict adults \n        can also occur in children and adolescents.\n            (2) In January 2001, the Report of the Surgeon General's \n        Conference on Children's Mental Health noted that 74 percent of \n        individuals age 21 with mental disorders had prior problems, \n        indicating that children's mental disorders often persist into \n        adulthood.\n            (3) Scientific research has demonstrated that early \n        identification and treatment of mental disorders in youth \n        greatly improves a child or adolescent's prognosis throughout \n        his or her lifetime.\n            (4) In January 2001, the Surgeon General noted that, while \n        1 in 10 children and adolescents in the United States suffers \n        from mental illness severe enough to cause some level of \n        impairment, only 1 in 5 of such children and adolescents \n        receives needed mental health treatment.\n            (5) In September 2002, the National Council on Disability \n        noted that between 60 and 70 percent of youth in the juvenile \n        justice system have an emotional disturbance and almost 50 \n        percent have co-occurring disabilities.\n            (6) The World Health Organization has reported that youth \n        neuropsychiatric disorders will rise by over 50 percent by \n        2020, making such disorders 1 of the top 5 causes of \n        disability, morbidity, and mortality among children and \n        adolescents.\n            (7) Psychological autopsy studies have found that 90 \n        percent of youths who end their own lives have depression or \n        another diagnosable mental or substance abuse disorder at the \n        time of their deaths, verifying a link between mental illness \n        and suicide.\n            (8) In 1999, the Surgeon General recognized that mental \n        illness and substance abuse disorders are, in fact, the \n        greatest risk factors for suicidal behavior, and that properly \n        identifying and treating mental illness and substance abuse \n        disorders are an important part of suicide prevention \n        activities.\n            (9) The National Council on Disability has also stated that \n        ``the failure to identify and treat mental disabilities between \n        children and youth has serious consequences, including school \n        failure, involvement with the justice system and other tragic \n        outcomes,'' including ``the growing problem of teen suicides \n        and/or suicide attempts''.\n            (10) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n        reported that in 2000 suicide was the 3rd leading cause of \n        death among youth 15 to 24 years of age.\n            (11) The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \n        Administration reported that in 1999 almost 3,000,000 youth \n        were at risk for suicide, but only 36 percent received mental \n        health treatment.\n            (12) According to the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance \n        System of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, among \n        high school students surveyed in 2001, 19 percent had seriously \n        considered attempting suicide, almost 15 percent had made a \n        specific plan to attempt suicide, almost 9 percent had \n        attempted suicide, and almost 3 percent had made an attempt at \n        suicide that required medical attention.\n            (13) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n        reported that each year in the United States, almost as many \n        adolescents and young adults commit suicide as die from all \n        natural causes combined, including leukemia, birth defects, \n        pneumonia, influenza, and AIDS.\n            (14) In January 2001, the Surgeon General issued a goal to \n        ``improve the assessment of and recognition of mental health \n        needs in children'' in part by encouraging ``early \n        identification of mental health needs in existing preschool, \n        child care, education, health, welfare, juvenile justice, and \n        substance abuse treatment systems''.\n            (15) Toward that end, the efforts, initiatives, and \n        activities of the Federal Government should be used to support \n        evidence-based preventive-screening methods to detect mental \n        illness and suicidal tendencies in school-age youth.\n\nSEC. 3.

PURCHASE OF SILVER BY THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\n\n    (a) Purchase of Silver.--\n            (1) In general.--Section 5116(b)(2) of title 31, United \n        States Code, is amended by inserting after the second sentence \n        the following: ``At such time as the silver stockpile is \n        depleted, the Secretary shall obtain silver as described in \n        paragraph (1) to mint coins authorized under section 5112(e). \n        If it is not economically feasible to obtain such silver, the \n        Secretary may obtain silver for coins authorized under section \n        5112(e) from other available sources. The Secretary shall not \n        pay more than the average world price for silver under any \n        circumstances. As used in this paragraph, the term `average \n        world price' means the price determined by a widely recognized \n        commodity exchange at the time the silver is obtained by the \n        Secretary.''.\n            (2) Rulemaking authority.--The Secretary of the Treasury \n        shall issue regulations to implement the amendments made by \n        paragraph (1).\n    (b) Study Required.--\n            (1) Study.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall conduct a \n        study of the impact on the United States silver market of the \n        coins minted and issued under section 5112(e) of title 31, \n        United States Code, commonly referred to as the ``American \n        Eagle silver bullion program''.\n            (2) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n        enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall \n        submit a report of the study conducted under paragraph (1) to \n        the chairman and ranking minority member of--\n                    (A) the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n                Affairs of the Senate; and\n                    (B) the Committee on Financial Services of the \n                House of Representatives.\n    (c) Annual Report.--\n            (1) In general.--The Director of the United States Mint \n        shall prepare and submit to Congress an annual report on the \n        purchases of silver made pursuant to this Act and the \n        amendments made by this Act.\n            (2) Concurrent submission.--The report required by \n        paragraph (1) may be incorporated into the annual report of the \n        Director of the United States Mint on the operations of the \n        mint and assay offices, referred to in section 1329 of title \n        44, United States Code.", "output": "Support of American Eagle Silver Bullion Program Act - Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to obtain silver from other available sources when the U.S. silver stockpile is depleted.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Preserving the American Historical \nRecord Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Much of the American historical record, such as \n        evidence of births, education, marriage, divorce, property \n        owned, obligations satisfied, and criminal conduct, is held at \n        the State and local level by organizations that preserve the \n        records that protect the rights of the Nation.\n            (2) The United States has recognized the importance of \n        history by its support of national institutions such as the \n        National Archives, the Library of Congress, and the Smithsonian \n        Institution. Yet, this support is not adequate to reach the \n        rest of the Nation's archives being held in State and local \n        historical societies, archives, and library history \n        collections.\n            (3) More resources need to be directed to State and local \n        organizations to ensure essential care of documents and \n        archival records in their many forms so that they can be \n        readily used by the people of this Nation.\n            (4) History connects people to community--whether the \n        community is a family, a neighborhood, a city, a State, or a \n        Nation. Connections to the past are essential to sustaining \n        democracy, educating students, creating a sense of place in \n        family and community, supporting information needs in business \n        and legal affairs, and making reasoned decisions about the \n        Nation's future direction.\n\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Pharmacy Education Aid Act of \n2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Pharmacists are an important link in our Nation's \n        health care system. A critical shortage of pharmacists is \n        threatening the ability of pharmacies to continue to provide \n        important prescription related services.\n            (2) In the landmark report entitled ``To Err is Human: \n        Building a Safer Health System'', the Institute of Medicine \n        reported that medication errors can be partially attributed to \n        factors that are indicative of a shortage of pharmacists (such \n        as too many customers, numerous distractions, and staff \n        shortages).\n            (3) Congress acknowledged in the Healthcare Research and \n        Quality Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-129) a growing demand for \n        pharmacists by requiring the Secretary of Health and Human \n        Services to conduct a study to determine whether there is a \n        shortage of pharmacists in the United States and, if so, to \n        what extent.\n            (4) As a result of Congress' concern about how a shortage \n        of pharmacists would impact the public health, the Secretary of \n        Health and Human Services published a report entitled ``The \n        Pharmacist Workforce: A Study in Supply and Demand for \n        Pharmacists'' in December of 2000.\n            (5) ``The Pharmacist Workforce: A Study in Supply and \n        Demand for Pharmacists'' found that ``While the overall supply \n        of pharmacists has increased in the past decade, there has been \n        an unprecedented demand for pharmacists and for pharmaceutical \n        care services, which has not been met by the currently \n        available supply'' and that the ``evidence clearly indicates \n        the emergence of a shortage of pharmacists over the past two \n        years''.\n            (6) The same study also found that ``The most striking \n        evidence of a pharmacist shortage stems from demonstrably \n        increased vacancy rates, difficulties in hiring, and \n        unprecedented increases in the volume and range of activities \n        demanded of today's pharmacist.''\n            (7) The study found that ``The factors causing the current \n        shortage are of a nature not likely to abate in the near future \n        without fundamental changes in pharmacy practice and \n        education.'' The study projects that the number of \n        prescriptions filled by community pharmacists will increase by \n        20 percent by 2004. In contrast, the number of community \n        pharmacists is expected to increase by only 6 percent by 2005.\n            (8) Regarding access to pharmacy services in rural areas, \n        the study found that ``Remoteness, isolation from other \n        professionals, lower economic returns, reduced opportunities \n        for advancement, and other rural practice characteristics \n        remain obstacles'' to attracting pharmacists.\n            (9) In June 2002, the American Hospital Association's \n        Commission on Workforce for Hospitals and Health Systems \n        released a report entitled ``In Our Hands: How Hospital Leaders \n        Can Build A Thriving Workforce''. The report included a finding \n        that 46 percent of our Nation's hospitals are experiencing a \n        shortage of pharmacists, with hospitals averaging a vacancy \n        rate for pharmacists of 12.7 percent.\n            (10) The demand for pharmacists will increase as \n        prescription drug use continues to grow.\n\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Iraq Contingency \nPlanning Act''.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to require the President \nto promptly inform Congress regarding what contingency plans are or \nwill be in place to respond to three scenarios regarding future \ndevelopments in Iraq as identified by the most recent National \nIntelligence Estimate on Iraq.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The United States initiated combat operations against \n        the Saddam Hussein regime on March 19, 2003, and concluded \n        those operations in April 2004 with the defeat of the Iraqi \n        military and the collapse of the Hussein regime.\n            (2) The Bush Administration had been warned that while \n        military action against the Hussein regime would likely \n        succeed, rebuilding Iraq and winning the peace would be more \n        difficult. In particular, intelligence reports from the Defense \n        Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon's Joint Staff, the Department \n        of State's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, and the Central \n        Intelligence Agency's National Intelligence Council warned that \n        United States troops could face significant postwar resistance. \n        An Army War College report from February 2003 warned that \n        without an ``overwhelming'' effort to prepare for the United \n        States occupation of Iraq, ``The United States may find itself \n        in a radically different world over the next few years, a world \n        in which the threat of Saddam Hussein seems like a pale shadow \n        of new problems of America's own making.''.\n            (3) Despite these warnings, the Bush Administration invaded \n        Iraq without a comprehensive plan in place to secure and \n        rebuild the country.\n            (4) United States Armed Forces personnel have remained in \n        Iraq since the beginning of combat operations, and in over \n        nearly four years of war, hundreds of thousands of members of \n        the Armed Forces have served with honor and distinction in \n        Iraq, over 3,100 members of the Armed Forces have died, and \n        over 22,500 members of the Armed Forces have been wounded.\n            (5) On January 10, 2007, after years of growing sectarian \n        violence in Iraq, President George W. Bush addressed the \n        American people to announce a plan entitled ``The New Way \n        Forward in Iraq'', consisting of the additional deployments of \n        at least 21,500 United States troops in Iraq.\n            (6) On January 16, 2007, the Secretary of Defense said that \n        ``we expect in certain areas to be able to see whether the \n        Iraqi government is carrying out the commitments that it has \n        made and that are so critical to the success of this strategy . \n        . . within two or three months.''.\n            (7) On February 5, 2007, the President submitted a request \n        for supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 2007, including \n        $5,600,000,000 to increase United States forces in the Iraqi \n        theater of operations to support the Government of Iraq with \n        21,500 United States ground forces and an expanded Naval \n        presence. At the same time, the President also submitted a \n        proposed budget for fiscal year 2008 which did not request \n        funding for these additional troops in Iraq.\n            (8) On February 1, 2007, the intelligence community \n        presented to the President the first National Intelligence \n        Estimate (NIE) on Iraq in nearly four years.\n            (9) The NIE, the most authoritative written judgment of the \n        Director of National Intelligence with respect to Iraq, states \n        that ``Iraqi society's growing polarization, the persistent \n        weakness of the security forces and the state in general, and \n        all sides' ready recourse to violence are collectively driving \n        an increase in communal and insurgent violence and political \n        extremism. Unless efforts to reverse these conditions show \n        measurable progress during ... the coming 12 to 18 months, we \n        assess that the overall security situation will continue to \n        deteriorate.''.\n            (10) The NIE states that as Iraq's security environment \n        worsens, three prospective security paths could emerge--\n                    (A) chaos leading to partition;\n                    (B) emergence of a Shia strongman; or\n                    (C) anarchic fragmentation of power.\n            (11) Congress needs to know how the Administration expects \n        to respond to each of those possibilities, and what specific \n        plans are being taken and what specific plans are being \n        developed to be able to respond to such possibilities.\n\nSEC. 3. REPORT ON CONTINGENCY PLANS FOR IRAQ.\n\n    (a) Report Required.--Not later than June 30, 2007, the President \nshall transmit to the Committees on Armed Services of the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate a report detailing contingency plans for \nhow the Department of Defense and other departments and agencies of the \nFederal Government will respond to the following three prospective \nsecurity paths in Iraq, as outlined in the 2007 National Intelligence \nEstimate (NIE) on Iraq:\n            (1) Chaos leading to partition.--Described by the NIE as \n        follows: ``A rapid deterioration in the capacity of Iraq's \n        central government to function, security services and other \n        aspects of sovereignty would collapse. Resulting widespread \n        fighting could produce de facto partition, dividing Iraq into \n        three mutually antagonistic parts. Collapse of this magnitude \n        would generate fierce violence for at least several years, \n        ranging well beyond the time frame of this estimate, before \n        settling into a partially stable end-state.''.\n            (2) Emergence of a shia strongman.--Described by the NIE as \n        follows: ``Instead of a disintegrating central government \n        producing partition, a security implosion could lead Iraq's \n        potentially most powerful group, the Shia, to assert its latent \n        strength.''.\n            (3) Anarchic fragmentation of power.--Described by the NIE \n        as follows: ``The emergence of a checkered pattern of local \n        control would present the greatest potential for instability, \n        mixing extreme ethno-sectarian violence with debilitating \n        intra-group clashes.''.\n    (b) Additional Information.--The report shall include detailed \ninformation regarding the proposed role of the United States Armed \nForces under each of the three prospective security paths referred to \nin subsection (a), including a comprehensive analysis to identify and \njustify the number of United States troops needed in each case, and the \nproposed roles of other departments and agencies of the Federal \nGovernment.", "output": "Iraq Contingency Planning Act - Requires the President by June 30, 2007, to report to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees detailing U.S. and U.S. Armed Forces contingency plans to respond to the following three scenarios regarding future developments in Iraq as identified by the most recent National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq: (1) chaos leading to partition; (2) emergence of a Shia strongman; and (3) anarchic fragmentation of power.", "category": "Summarization 751.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given text for US Congressional and California state bills, your task is to generate a summary for this bill.", "input": "SECTION 1.

(Sec. 2) A federal agency may not deploy or make available to the public a new federal PII website until the agency's chief information officer (CIO) certifies to Congress that the website is fully functional and secure. The CIO must make such certification within 90 days after enactment of this Act. After such 90-day period, any new federal PII website that has not been certified must be rendered inaccessible until certification is submitted.  The prohibition does not apply to a website that is: (1) operated entirely by an entity that is independent of the federal government, or (2) in a development or testing phase (beta website). The exemption for beta websites applies only if: (1) a member of the public may access PII-related portions of the website only after executing an agreement that acknowledges the risks involved; and (2) no agency compelled, enjoined, or otherwise provided incentives for a member of the public to access such website.  The bill defines a \"new federal PII website\" as a website that: (1) is operated by (or under contract with) an agency; (2) elicits, collects, stores, or maintains PII and is accessible to the public; and (3) is first made accessible to the public and collects or stores PII on or after October 1, 2012. The bill also sets forth requirements that must be met to deem a new federal PII website as \"secure.\" (Sec. 3) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) must establish and oversee policies and procedures for federal agencies to follow in the event of a breach of information security involving the disclosure of PII, including: (1) notice, not later than 72 hours after discovery of a breach or possible breach, to individuals whose PII could be compromised; and (2) timely reporting to a federal cybersecurity center designated by the OMB and defined in this Act.  Agency heads must ensure that agency actions taken in response to a breach of information security involving the disclosure of PII comply with OMB policies and procedures established by this Act. The OMB must report to Congress, not later than March 1 of each year, on agency compliance with such policies and procedures.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``NATO-Western Balkans Support Act of \n2009''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The commitment of the North Atlantic Treaty \n        Organization (NATO) to mutual defense and the territorial \n        integrity of its members has advanced the democratic \n        transformation of Central and Eastern Europe and significantly \n        enhanced the security of Europe. Nowhere in Europe has the \n        search for sustainable peace been more challenging than in the \n        Western Balkans. NATO has the ability to encourage the \n        countries of the Western Balkans to embrace collective \n        security, consolidate their democratic gains, and extend their \n        commitment to integration in Euro-Atlantic institutions.\n            (2) NATO membership offers the ultimate protection against \n        perceived external threats and has demonstrated its role in \n        lowering regional tensions. Croatia's successful accession to \n        NATO has encouraged other states of the Western Balkans to \n        consider the possibility of their own membership more \n        seriously. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro are already \n        seriously engaged in the process of meeting NATO membership \n        criteria as active members of the Partnership for Peace and \n        Intensified Dialogue with NATO.\n            (3) In Western Balkan states like Bosnia and Herzegovina \n        and Montenegro, the process of NATO accession can provide focus \n        for ongoing efforts to improve the functionality and efficiency \n        of the armed forces and the state more broadly. In Bosnia and \n        Herzegovina, many reforms necessary to improve the \n        functionality of the state, such as resolution of the defense-\n        related property issue, are also necessary for NATO membership.\n            (4) The success of Serbia is central to the success of the \n        Western Balkans. The United States Government welcomes the \n        decision of the democratically elected Government of Serbia to \n        join the Partnership for Peace Program in 2006 and encourages \n        as strong a relationship as is possible between NATO and the \n        Government and people of Serbia. As Vice President Joseph Biden \n        said in Belgrade on May 20, 2009, ``The United States strongly \n        supports Serbian membership in the European Union and expanding \n        security cooperation between Serbia, the United States, and our \n        allies. We will use our influence, our energy, and our \n        resources to promote Serbia's Euro-Atlantic aspirations.''.\n            (5) In the NATO Participation Act of 1994 (title II of \n        Public Law 103-447; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note), Congress declared \n        that ``full and active participants in the Partnership for \n        Peace in a position to further the principles of the North \n        Atlantic Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North \n        Atlantic area should be invited to become full NATO members in \n        accordance with Article 10 of such Treaty at an early date''.\n            (6) Under the NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996 (as \n        enacted into law by section 101(c) of title I of division A of \n        Public Law 104-208; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note), Congress called for \n        the prompt admission of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, \n        and Slovenia to NATO, and declared that ``in order to promote \n        economic stability and security in Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, \n        Lithuania, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Moldova, and Ukraine . . \n        . the process of enlarging NATO to include emerging democracies \n        in Central and Eastern Europe should not be limited to \n        consideration of admitting Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, \n        and Slovenia as full members of the NATO Alliance''.\n            (7) In the European Security Act of 1998 (title XXVII of \n        division G of Public Law 105-277; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note), \n        Congress declared that ``Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \n        Republic should not be the last emerging democracies in Central \n        and Eastern Europe invited to join NATO''.\n            (8) In the Gerald B. H. Solomon Freedom Consolidation Act \n        of 2002 (Public Law 107-187; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note), Congress \n        endorsed ``. . . the vision of further enlargement of the NATO \n        Alliance articulated by President George W. Bush on June 15, \n        2001, and by former President William J. Clinton on October 22, \n        1996.''.\n            (9) At the Madrid Summit of the North Atlantic Treaty \n        Organization in July 1997, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \n        Republic were invited to join NATO, and the North Atlantic \n        Treaty Organization heads of state and government issued a \n        declaration stating, ``The alliance expects to extend further \n        invitations in coming years to nations willing and able to \n        assume the responsibilities and obligations of membership . . . \n        No European democratic country whose admission would fulfill \n        the objectives of the [North Atlantic] Treaty will be excluded \n        from consideration''.\n            (10) At the Washington, DC, Summit of the North Atlantic \n        Treaty Organization in April 1999, the North Atlantic Treaty \n        Organization heads of state and government issued a communique \n        declaring, ``We pledge that NATO will continue to welcome new \n        members in a position to further the principles of the [North \n        Atlantic] Treaty and contribute to peace and security in the \n        Euro-Atlantic area . . . The three new members will not be the \n        last . . . No European democratic country whose admission would \n        fulfill the objectives of the Treaty will be excluded from \n        consideration, regardless of its geographic location''.\n            (11) On June 15, 2001, in a speech in Warsaw, Poland, \n        President George W. Bush stated, ``All of Europe's new \n        democracies, from the Baltic to the Black Sea and all that lie \n        between, should have the same chance for security and freedom--\n        and the same chance to join the institutions of Europe--as \n        Europe's old democracies have . . . I believe in NATO \n        membership for all of Europe's democracies that seek it and are \n        ready to share the responsibilities that NATO brings . . .''.\n            (12) On October 22, 1996, in a speech in Detroit, Michigan, \n        former President William J. Clinton stated, ``NATO's doors will \n        not close behind its first new members . . . NATO should remain \n        open to all of Europe's emerging democracies who are ready to \n        shoulder the responsibilities of membership . . . No nation \n        will be automatically excluded . . . No country outside NATO \n        will have a veto . . . A gray zone of insecurity must not \n        reemerge in Europe.''.\n            (13) At the Prague Summit of the North Atlantic Treaty \n        Organization in November 2002, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, \n        Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia were invited to join \n        NATO in the second round of enlargement of the North Atlantic \n        Treaty Organization since the end of the Cold War, and the \n        North Atlantic Treaty Organization heads of state and \n        government issued a declaration stating, ``NATO's door will \n        remain open to European democracies willing and able to assume \n        the responsibilities and obligations of membership, in \n        accordance with Article 10 of the Washington Treaty.''.\n            (14) At the Istanbul Summit of the North Atlantic Treaty \n        Organization in June 2004, the North Atlantic Treaty \n        Organization heads of state and government issued a communique \n        reaffirming that NATO's door remains open to new members, \n        declaring, ``We celebrate the success of NATO's Open Door \n        Policy, and reaffirm today that our seven new members will not \n        be the last. The door to membership remains open.''.\n            (15) At the Riga Summit of the NATO Alliance November 2006, \n        NATO heads of state and government affirmed in their \n        declaration that ``Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and \n        Serbia can offer valuable contributions to regional stability \n        and security'' and that NATO should ``encourage further \n        positive developments in the region on its path towards Euro-\n        Atlantic integration''. It was at Riga that Bosnia and \n        Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Serbia were offered membership in \n        the Partnership for Peace and Euro-Atlantic Partnership \n        Council.\n            (16) At the Bucharest Summit of the NATO Alliance in April \n        2008, the NATO heads of state and government issued a \n        declaration stating that in the Balkans, ``Euro-Atlantic \n        integration, based on democratic values and regional \n        cooperation, remains necessary for lasting peace and \n        stability.'' The Declaration also noted that ``we have decided \n        to invite Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro to begin an \n        Intensified Dialogue on the full range of political, military, \n        financial, and security issues relating to their aspirations to \n        membership''.\n            (17) At the Strasbourg/Kehl NATO Summit, the heads of state \n        and government participating in the meeting of the North \n        Atlantic Council on April 4, 2009, reiterated that ``[i]n \n        accordance with Article 10 of the Washington Treaty, NATO's \n        door will remain open to all European democracies which share \n        the values of our Alliance, which are willing and able to \n        assume the responsibilities and obligations of membership, and \n        whose inclusion can contribute to common security and \n        stability''.\n            (18) The Summit Declaration also acknowledged the progress \n        of the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina on ``cooperation \n        with NATO, including through implementation of its current \n        IPAP, and the country's expressed intention to apply for MAP at \n        an appropriate time.'' The declaration also urged ``Bosnia and \n        Herzegovina's political leaders to take further genuine steps \n        to strengthen state-level institutions and reinvigorate the \n        reform process to advance the country's Euro-Atlantic \n        aspirations.''.\n            (19) With respect to Montenegro, the NATO heads of state \n        and government declared at the 2009 Strasbourg/Kehl NATO \n        Summit, ``We welcome Montenegro's successful and active \n        implementation of its current Individual Partnership Action \n        Plan (IPAP) with NATO. We are encouraged by the reforms it has \n        made in a number of areas that are essential to its Euro-\n        Atlantic integration and also by its contributions to \n        cooperation and security in the region. We are looking forward \n        to Montenegro's further determined efforts in this regard. The \n        Council in permanent session is keeping Montenegro's progress \n        under active review and will respond early to its request to \n        participate in the Membership Action Plan (MAP), on its own \n        merits.''.\n            (20) Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro deserve \n        recognition for their cooperation with the International \n        Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). Although \n        Serbia has not yet completely fulfilled its ICTY obligations, \n        the continued support of the Government of Serbia for the \n        process until its conclusion is the best way to ensure the \n        peace and to prepare the way to full participation of Serbia in \n        European institutions.\n\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Arrest Methamphetamine Act of \n2005''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Methamphetamine (meth) is an extremely dangerous and \n        highly addictive drug.\n            (2) Methamphetamine use contributes to the perpetration of \n        violent crimes, particularly burglary, child abuse, and crimes \n        of substantial cost and personal pain to the victims, including \n        identity theft.\n            (3) Methamphetamine labs produce hazardous conditions \n        because of their use of chemicals such as anhydrous ammonia, \n        ether, sulfuric acid, and other toxins which are volatile, \n        corrosive and poisonous. When these substances are illegally \n        disposed of in rivers, streams, and other dump areas, \n        explosions and serious environmental damage can and does \n        result.\n            (4) Since 2001, Federal funding has been provided through \n        the Department of Justice COPS and Byrne Grant programs to \n        address methamphetamine enforcement and clean up. Since 2002, \n        although the methamphetamine problem has been growing and \n        spreading across the United States, COPS funding has been cut \n        each successive year, from $70,500,000 in 2002, to under \n        $52,000,000 in 2005.\n            (5) As methamphetamine has impacted more States each year, \n        the dwindling Federal funds have been parsed into smaller \n        amounts. Each State deserves greater Federal support and a \n        permanent funding mechanism to confront the challenging problem \n        of methamphetamine abuse.\n            (6) Permanent Federal funding support for meth enforcement \n        and clean-up is critical to the efforts of State and local law \n        enforcement to reduce the use, manufacture, and sale of \n        methamphetamine, and thus, reduce the crime rate.\n            (7) It is necessary for the Federal Government to establish \n        a long-term commitment to confronting methamphetamine use, \n        sale, and manufacture by creating a permanent funding mechanism \n        to assist States.\n\nSEC. 3.

Sense of Congress.\nSec. 202. NIH research on cancer symptom management improvement.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Many people with cancer experience side effects, \n        symptoms, and late complications associated with their disease \n        and their treatment, which can have a serious adverse impact on \n        their health, well-being, and quality of life.\n            (2) Many side effects and symptoms associated with cancer \n        and its treatment can be reduced or controlled by the provision \n        of timely symptom management and services and also by educating \n        people with cancer and their caregivers about the potential \n        effects before treatment begins.\n            (3) Studies have found that individualized educational \n        intervention for cancer pain management from a registered nurse \n        was effective for patients with cancer being treated in \n        outpatient and home-based settings. Similarly, the number of \n        caregivers who said they were well informed and confident about \n        caregiving after attending a family caregiver cancer education \n        program increased after program attendance.\n            (4) People with cancer benefit from having an educational \n        session with oncology nurses in advance of the initiation of \n        treatment to learn how to reduce the risk of and manage adverse \n        effects and maximize well-being. Helping patients to manage \n        their side effects reduces adverse events and the need for \n        urgent or inpatient care.\n            (5) The Oncology Nursing Society has received reports from \n        its members that, because the Medicare program and other payers \n        do not cover the provision of patient treatment education, \n        patients and their caregivers often do not receive adequate \n        education before the onset of such patients' treatment for \n        cancer regarding the course of such treatment and the possible \n        side effects and symptoms such patients may experience. The \n        Oncology Nursing Society recommends that all patients being \n        treated for cancer have a one-on-one educational session with a \n        nurse in advance of the onset of such treatment so that such \n        patients and their caregivers receive the information they need \n        to help minimize adverse events related to such treatment and \n        maximize the well-being of such patients.\n            (6) Insufficient or nonexistent Medicare payments coupled \n        with poor investment in symptom management research contribute \n        to the inadequate education of patients, poor management and \n        monitoring of cancer symptoms, and inadequate handling of late \n        effects of cancer and its treatment.\n            (7) People with cancer often do not have the symptoms \n        associated with their disease and the associated treatment \n        managed in a comprehensive or appropriate manner.\n            (8) People with cancer deserve to have access to \n        comprehensive care that includes appropriate treatment and \n        symptom management.\n            (9) Patients who receive infused chemotherapy likely obtain \n        some treatment education during the course of the \n        administration of their treatment; yet, many do not, and \n        individuals who may receive a different type of cancer care, \n        such as radiation or surgical interventions or oral \n        chemotherapy taken at home, likely do not receive treatment \n        education during their treatment.\n            (10) Comprehensive cancer care must include access to \n        services and management associated with nausea, vomiting, \n        fatigue, depression, pain, and other symptoms.\n            (11) The Institute of Medicine report, ``Ensuring Quality \n        Cancer Care'' asserts that ``much can be done to relieve the \n        symptoms, ease distress, provide comfort, and in other ways \n        improve the quality of life of someone with cancer. For a \n        person with cancer, maintenance of quality of life requires, at \n        a minimum, relief from pain and other distressing symptoms, \n        relief from anxiety and depressions, including the fear of \n        pain, and a sense of security that assistance will be readily \n        available if needed.''.\n            (12) The Institute of Medicine report, ``Cancer Care for \n        the Whole Patient: Meeting Psychosocial Health Needs'' \n        recognizes that cancer patients' psychosocial needs include \n        information about their therapies and the potential side \n        effects.\n            (13) As more than half of all cancer diagnoses occur among \n        individuals age 65 and older, the challenges of managing cancer \n        symptoms are growing for patients enrolled in the Medicare \n        program.\n            (14) Provision of Medicare payment for comprehensive cancer \n        patient treatment education, coupled with expanded cancer \n        symptom management research, will help improve care and quality \n        of life for people with cancer from the time of diagnosis \n        through survivorship or end of life.\n\n  TITLE I--COMPREHENSIVE CANCER PATIENT TREATMENT EDUCATION UNDER THE \n                            MEDICARE PROGRAM\n\nSEC. 101.

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) It is in the interest of the United States to maximize \n        economic return from the growing trade in cruise ship sailings \n        to and from Alaska by encouraging the use of United States \n        berthing and repair facilities, labor, supplies, and other \n        services, as well as the growth of new enterprises such as the \n        carriage of passengers on luxury cruises between ports in \n        Alaska.\n            (2) In promoting additional economic benefits to the United \n        States from the cruise ship industry, there is a need to ensure \n        that existing employment and economic activity associated with \n        the Alaska Marine Highway System, United States-flag tour boats \n        operating from Alaska ports, and similar efforts are protected \n        from adverse impacts.\n            (3) Cruise ship sailings to Alaska comprise a vital and \n        growing segment of the United States travel industry. The \n        number of passengers entering or leaving Alaska via cruise ship \n        increased by 14 percent in the last two years alone, and is \n        expected to continue increasing at a similar or higher rate.\n            (4) No United States-flag cruise ships are presently \n        available to enter the Alaska trade. Thus, all cruise ships \n        carrying passengers to and from Alaska destinations are \n        foreign-flag vessels which are precluded, under current law, \n        from carrying passengers from other United States ports to \n        ports in Alaska, and from carrying passengers between ports in \n        Alaska.\n            (5) The City of Vancouver, British Columbia receives \n        substantial economic benefit through providing services to \n        cruise ships in the Alaska trade, including direct and indirect \n        employment of 2,435 persons in 1992, and direct and indirect \n        payments for goods and services of $119,700,000.\n            (6) The transfer of cruise ship-based economic activity \n        from Vancouver, British Columbia to United States ports could, \n        at 1992 spending levels, yield additional Federal Government \n        revenues of $97,600,000 per annum, and additional State and \n        local government revenues of $29,700,000.\n\nSEC. 2.

FINDINGS.\n\n     The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) When it is possible to reduce the regulatory burden on \n        depository institutions associated with reporting requirements \n        under chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code, while at the \n        same time maintaining the utility of such reports to law \n        enforcement efforts, it is appropriate to do so.\n            (2) In February 2008, the Comptroller General issued a \n        report titled ``Bank Secrecy Act: Increased Use of Exemption \n        Provisions Could Reduce Currency Transaction Reporting While \n        Maintaining Usefulness to Law Enforcement Efforts'' (GAO-08-\n        355).\n            (3) The Comptroller General finds that since transactions \n        of exempt customers are of little or no value to law \n        enforcement efforts, efforts made to increase the use of such \n        exemptions by depository institutions could reduce the \n        regulatory burden associated with filing unnecessary cash \n        transaction reports and the government's costs to process them, \n        while maintaining the utility of such reports to law \n        enforcement efforts.\n            (4) The Comptroller General finds that the requirement that \n        depository institutions file biennial renewals for Phase II \n        customer exemptions duplicates the required annual review of \n        such exemptions and discourages the use of some exemptions.\n            (5) The Comptroller General finds that eliminating the \n        requirement that depository institutions file biennial renewals \n        for Phase II customer exemptions could increase the use of such \n        exemptions and reduce the burden associated with filing \n        unnecessary cash transaction reports.\n            (6) The Comptroller General recommends eliminating the \n        requirement that depository institutions biennially renew Phase \n        II exemptions.\n            (7) The Comptroller General finds that the cash \n        transactions of government entities and depository institutions \n        are likely of little or no use to law enforcement efforts and \n        that cash transaction reports related to these entities are \n        unnecessary.\n            (8) The Comptroller General finds that, although the \n        amendments made to chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code, \n        by the Money Laundering Suppression Act of 1994 required the \n        Secretary of the Treasury to exempt depository institutions \n        from filing cash transaction reports on the transactions of \n        government entities and depository institutions and did not \n        explicitly require the filing of exemption forms or annual \n        review of such information with respect to the exempt entities \n        to effectuate any such exemption, the regulations prescribed by \n        the Secretary nonetheless require depository institutions to \n        file such exemption forms and annual reviews.\n            (9) The Comptroller General finds that the requirement that \n        depository institutions file forms to exempt government \n        entities and depository institutions, and conduct annual \n        reviews of related information, discourages the use of such \n        exemptions and creates cash transaction reports that are of \n        little or no value to law enforcement efforts.\n            (10) The Comptroller General recommends eliminating the \n        requirement that depository institutions file exemption forms \n        and annually review the supporting information for government \n        entities and depository institutions.\n            (11) The Comptroller General finds that requiring \n        depository institutions to wait 12 months before exempting \n        certain customers with large numbers of cash transactions may \n        needlessly create cash transaction reports that are not highly \n        useful to law enforcement efforts.\n            (12) The Comptroller General finds that allowing depository \n        institutions to exempt clients with frequent cash transactions \n        within a time period of less than a year could avoid the filing \n        of unnecessary cash transaction reports.\n            (13) The Comptroller General recommends considering a \n        change in requirements to allow depository institutions to \n        exempt otherwise-eligible customers with frequent large cash \n        transactions within a period of time shorter than 12 months.\n\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Public Safety Employer-Employee \nCooperation Act of 2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. DECLARATION OF PURPOSE AND POLICY.\n\n    The Congress declares that the following is the policy of the \nUnited States:\n            (1) Labor-management relationships and partnerships are \n        based on trust, mutual respect, open communication, bilateral \n        consensual problem solving, and shared accountability. Labor-\n        management cooperation fully utilizes the strengths of both \n        parties to best serve the interests of the public, operating as \n        a team, to carry out the public safety mission in a quality \n        work environment. In many public safety agencies it is the \n        union that provides the institutional stability as elected \n        leaders and appointees come and go.\n            (2) The Federal Government needs to encourage conciliation, \n        mediation, and voluntary arbitration to aid and encourage \n        employers and their employees to reach and maintain agreements \n        concerning rates of pay, hours, and working conditions, and to \n        make all reasonable efforts through negotiations to settle \n        their differences by mutual agreement reached through \n        collective bargaining or by such methods as may be provided for \n        in any applicable agreement for the settlement of disputes.\n            (3) The absence of adequate cooperation between public \n        safety employers and employees has implications for the \n        security of employees and can affect interstate and intrastate \n        commerce. The lack of such labor-management cooperation can \n        detrimentally impact the upgrading of police and fire services \n        of local communities, the health and well-being of public \n        safety officers, and the morale of the fire and police \n        departments. Additionally, these factors could have significant \n        commercial repercussions. Moreover, providing minimal standards \n        for collective bargaining negotiations in the public safety \n        sector can prevent industrial strife between labor and \n        management that interferes with the normal flow of commerce.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Authority.--The term ``Authority'' means the Federal \n        Labor Relations Authority.\n            (2) Emergency medical services personnel.--The term \n        ``emergency medical services personnel'' means an individual \n        who provides out-of-hospital emergency medical care, including \n        an emergency medical technician, paramedic, or first responder.\n            (3) Employer; public safety agency.--The terms ``employer'' \n        and ``public safety agency'' mean any State, political \n        subdivision of a State, the District of Columbia, or any \n        territory or possession of the United States that employs \n        public safety officers.\n            (4) Firefighter.--The term ``firefighter'' has the meaning \n        given the term ``employee engaged in fire protection \n        activities'' in section 3(y) of the Fair Labor Standards Act \n        (29 U.S.C. 203(y)).\n            (5) Labor organization.--The term ``labor organization'' \n        means an organization composed in whole or in part of \n        employees, in which employees participate, and which represents \n        such employees before public safety agencies concerning \n        grievances, conditions of employment and related matters.\n            (6) Law enforcement officer.--The term ``law enforcement \n        officer'' has the meaning given such term in section 1204(5) of \n        the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 \n        U.S.C. 3796b(5)).\n            (7) Management employee.--The term ``management employee'' \n        has the meaning given such term under applicable State law in \n        effect on the date of enactment of this Act.

If no \nsuch State law is in effect, the term means an individual, employed by \na public safety employer, who--\n                    (A) has the authority in the interest of the \n                employer to hire, direct, assign, promote, reward, \n                transfer, furlough, lay off, recall, suspend, \n                discipline, or remove public safety officers, to adjust \n                their grievances, or to effectively recommend such \n                action, if the exercise of the authority is not merely \n                routine or clerical in nature but requires the \n                consistent exercise of independent judgment; and\n                    (B) devotes a majority of time at work exercising \n                such authority.\n\nSEC. 4.

In making such \n        determinations, the Authority shall consider and give weight, \n        to the maximum extent practicable, to the opinion of affected \n        parties.\n            (2) Subsequent determinations.--\n                    (A) In general.--A determination made pursuant to \n                paragraph (1) shall remain in effect unless and until \n                the Authority issues a subsequent determination, in \n                accordance with the procedures set forth in \n                subparagraph (B).\n                    (B) Procedures for subsequent determinations.--Upon \n                establishing that a material change in State law or its \n                interpretation has occurred, an employer or a labor \n                organization may submit a written request for a \n                subsequent determination.

Directs the FLRA, in such cases, to: (1) determine the appropriateness of units for labor organization representation; (2) supervise or conduct elections to determine whether a labor organization has been selected as an exclusive representative by a majority of the employees in an appropriate unit; (3) resolve issues relating to the duty to bargain in good faith; (4) conduct hearings and resolve complaints of unfair labor practices; and (5) resolve exceptions to arbitrator's awards. Grants a public safety employer, employee, or labor organization the right to seek enforcement of such FLRA regulations and authority through appropriate State courts. (Sec. 6) Prohibits public safety employers, employees, and labor organizations from engaging in lockouts or strikes, or sick-outs, work slowdowns, or other actions designed to compel agreement to a proposed contract which will measurably disrupt the delivery of emergency services. (Sec. 7) Provides that existing collective bargaining units and agreements shall not be invalidated by this Act. (Sec. 8) Provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed to: (1) invalidate or limit the remedies, rights, and procedures of any State or local law that provides collective bargaining rights for public safety officers that are equal to or greater than the rights provided under this Act; (2) prevent a State from enforcing a right-to-work law that prohibits employers and labor organizations from negotiating provisions in a labor agreement that require union membership or payment of union fees as a condition of employment; (3) invalidate any State law in effect on the date of enactment of this Act that substantially provides for the rights and responsibilities specified by this Act solely because such State law permits employees to appear on their own behalf with respect to their employment relations with the public safety agency involved; (4) permit parties subject to the National Labor Relations Act and its regulations to negotiate provisions that would prohibit an employee from engaging in part-time employment or volunteer activities during off-duty hours; or (5) prohibit a State from exempting from coverage under this Act a local government that serves a population of less than 5,000 or that employs less than 25 full-time employees (not including individuals elected by popular vote or appointed to serve on a board or commission). Prohibits any State from preempting local government laws or ordinances that provide collective bargaining rights for public safety officers that are equal to or greater than the rights provided under this Act.

FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) lupus is a serious, complex, inflammatory, autoimmune \n        disease of particular concern to women;\n            (2) lupus affects women 9 times more often than men;\n            (3) there are 3 main types of lupus: systemic lupus, a \n        serious form of the disease that affects many parts of the \n        body; discoid lupus, a form of the disease that affects mainly \n        the skin; and drug-induced lupus caused by certain medications;\n            (4) lupus can be fatal if not detected and treated early;\n            (5) the disease can simultaneously affect various areas of \n        the body, such as the skin, joints, kidneys, and brain, and can \n        be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms of lupus are \n        similar to those of many other diseases;\n            (6) lupus disproportionately affects African-American \n        women, as the prevalence of the disease among such women is 3 \n        times the prevalence among white women, and an estimated 1 in \n        250 African-American women between the ages of 15 and 65 \n        develops the disease;\n            (7) it has been estimated that between 1,400,000 and \n        2,000,000 Americans have been diagnosed with the disease, and \n        that many more have undiagnosed cases;\n            (8) current treatments for the disease can be effective, \n        but may lead to damaging side effects;\n            (9) many victims of the disease suffer debilitating pain \n        and fatigue, making it difficult to maintain employment and \n        lead normal lives; and\n            (10) in fiscal year 1996, the amount allocated by the \n        National Institutes of Health for research on lupus was \n        $33,000,000, which is less than \\1/2\\ of 1 percent of the \n        budget for such Institutes.\n\n                       TITLE I--RESEARCH ON LUPUS\n\nSEC. 101.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Ensuring Access to Primary Care for \nWomen & Children Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Medicaid plays a key role in providing coverage for \n        millions of working families.\n            (2) Medicaid enrollees include families, pregnant women, \n        children, individuals with disabilities, and other low-income \n        individuals. Without Medicaid coverage, many enrollees would be \n        uninsured or lack coverage for services they need.\n            (3) In 2013, the Medicaid program covered 62,000,000 \n        individuals, or 1 in every 5 Americans. This number will \n        continue to grow, particularly since the Affordable Care Act \n        significantly expanded eligibility to millions of uninsured \n        adults. Enrollment in Medicaid and the Children's Health \n        Insurance Program is projected to increase by 12,800,000 by \n        2016.\n            (4) If all States expand their Medicaid programs, an \n        estimated 7,000,000 women ages 18 to 64 would gain coverage \n        under Medicaid.\n            (5) In 47 States and in the District of Columbia, Medicaid \n        pays up to 67 percent less than Medicare for the same primary \n        care services.\n            (6) Multiple studies have concluded that higher Medicaid \n        payment rates would increase the probability of primary care \n        providers accepting new Medicaid patients, and would further \n        support current Medicaid providers.\n            (7) Congress has recognized that low provider participation \n        in Medicaid decreases access to health care. To address this \n        problem, Congress acted to increase Medicaid payments for \n        certain primary care services to be not less than the Medicare \n        payment rates for 2013 and 2014.\n            (8) As more Americans become insured and empowered \n        participants in their own health care, demand for primary care \n        services is expected to increase over the next few years.\n            (9) Six in 10 women ages 18 to 44 (58 percent) report they \n        see an obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) physician on a \n        regular basis. They are more likely to see their OB/GYN \n        physician on a regular basis than any other type of provider. \n        Given that women comprise the majority of Medicaid enrollees, \n        it is critical that primary care providers, including OB/GYN \n        physicians, receive sufficient reimbursement to participate in \n        Medicaid.\n            (10) Nurse practitioners and other mid-level health \n        professionals deliver many primary care services. Applying \n        Medicare's rates for nurse practitioners and mid-level health \n        professionals encourages greater participation in Medicaid, \n        thereby increasing access to primary care, particularly in \n        underserved areas.\n            (11) The enhanced Medicaid reimbursement rate ensures \n        providers have the financial capability to serve their \n        patients' primary care needs. Furthermore, adding nurse \n        practitioners, physician assistants, certified nurse-midwives, \n        and OB/GYN physicians serving in primary care settings \n        increases access to critical health care services for women and \n        children nationwide.\n\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Firearms Heritage Protection Act of \n1999''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Citizens have a right, under the Second Amendment to \n        the United States Constitution, to keep and bear arms.\n            (2) Lawsuits have been commenced against manufacturers, \n        distributors, dealers, and importers of nondefective firearms, \n        which seek money damages and other relief for the harm caused \n        by the misuse of firearms by third parties, including \n        criminals.\n            (3) The manufacture, importation, possession, sale, and use \n        of firearms and ammunition in the United States is heavily \n        regulated by Federal, State, and local laws. Such Federal laws \n        include the Gun Control Act of 1968, the National Firearms Act, \n        and the Arms Export Control Act.\n            (4) Businesses in the United States that are engaged in \n        interstate and foreign commerce through the lawful design, \n        marketing, distribution, manufacture, importation, or sale to \n        the public of firearms or ammunition that have been shipped or \n        transported in interstate or foreign commerce are not, and \n        should not be, liable for the harm caused by those who \n        criminally or unlawfully misuse firearm products or ammunition \n        products.\n            (5) The possibility of imposing liability on an entire \n        industry for harm that is the sole responsibility of others is \n        an abuse of the legal system, erodes public confidence our \n        Nation's laws, threatens the diminution of a basic \n        constitutional right, invites the disassembly and \n        destabilization of other industries and economic sectors \n        lawfully competing in America's free enterprise system, and \n        constitutes an unreasonable burden on interstate and foreign \n        commerce.\n            (6) The liability actions commenced or contemplated by \n        municipalities and cities are based on theories without \n        foundation in hundreds of years of the common law and American \n        jurisprudence. The possible sustaining of these actions by a \n        maverick judicial officer would expand civil liability in a \n        manner never contemplated by the Framers of the Constitution. \n        The Congress further finds that such an expansion of liability \n        would constitute a deprivation of the rights, privileges, and \n        immunities guaranteed to a citizen of the United States under \n        the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n            (1) To prohibit causes of action against manufacturers, \n        distributors, dealers, and importers of firearms or ammunition \n        products for the harm caused by the criminal or unlawful misuse \n        of firearm products or ammunition products by others.\n            (2) To preserve a citizen's access to a supply of firearms \n        and ammunition for all lawful purposes, including hunting, \n        self-defense, collecting, and competitive or recreational \n        shooting.\n            (3) To guarantee a citizen's rights, privileges, and \n        immunities, as applied to the States, under the Fourteenth \n        Amendment to the United States Constitution, pursuant to \n        section five of that Amendment.\n\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``National Student Dropout Prevention \nand Recovery Act of 2000''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Lowering the student dropout rate is one of the most \n        significant challenges facing educators today. Students must \n        stay in school in order to receive the education they need to \n        succeed in the new economy and contribute fully to American \n        society.\n            (2) The ability of local educational agencies to lower the \n        student dropout rate has been inhibited by the lack of focus at \n        the Federal level and the limited availability of appropriate \n        dropout prevention-focused curriculum, instruction, \n        professional development, and administrative support services.\n            (3) According to the National Dropout Prevention Network, \n        it is at the local and community level where school \n        improvements and change occur that will eventually have an \n        impact on the graduation rate of students. The focus of these \n        efforts should be concentrated on the most successful \n        strategies that research has identified as having an impact on \n        increasing the graduation rate. These strategies encompass--\n                    (A) systemic renewal;\n                    (B) community collaboration;\n                    (C) professional development;\n                    (D) family involvement;\n                    (E) early childhood education;\n                    (F) reading and writing programs;\n                    (G) individualized instruction;\n                    (H) instructional technologies;\n                    (I) mentoring and tutoring;\n                    (J) service learning;\n                    (K) learning styles and multiple intelligences;\n                    (L) violence prevention and conflict resolution;\n                    (M) career education and workforce readiness;\n                    (N) out-of-school experiences; and\n                    (O) alternative public schooling.\n            (4) The National Dropout Prevention Network has found that \n        the strategies described in paragraph (3) have been successful \n        in all school levels from K-12 in rural, suburban, or urban \n        centers. When schools or school districts develop a program \n        improvement plan that encompasses most or all of these \n        strategies, positive outcomes will result.\n            (5) It is necessary to develop a number of model dropout \n        prevention programs to fully develop the effective strategies \n        listed above into comprehensive dropout prevention programs. \n        These model programs should be used as examples by schools \n        across the country that wish to implement similar programs. \n        Subsequently, a nationwide dropout prevention program, in order \n        to be effective, should be based on these model programs.\n            (6) Dropout prevention and recovery programs which are \n        proven to be successful in lowering dropout rates need to be \n        disseminated to school and community leaders willing to adapt \n        and support these innovative programs in their schools and \n        community.\n\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Adolescent Web Awareness Requires \nEducation Act'' or the ``AWARE Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Internet is an invaluable tool that is critical to \n        the ability of the Nation to compete in a global economy. The \n        Internet provides instant access to research and boundless \n        information and connects individuals around the world.\n            (2) About 93 percent of youth ages 12 through 17 years use \n        online services regularly and nearly 45 percent of children \n        ages 3 to 11 years will use the Internet on a monthly basis in \n        2009. Eighty-nine percent of teens have a profile on social \n        networking sites. Eighty percent of teens ages 13 through 17 \n        years use cell phones, most of which have built-in cameras.\n            (3) Bullying in schools can take many forms, including \n        sending insulting, threatening, or offensive messages via \n        Internet sites, email, instant messaging, cell phone text \n        messaging, telephone, or any other electronic messaging system.\n            (4) In a recent survey, 1 in 5 teenagers stated that they \n        had used their cell phones to send explicit photos of \n        themselves to a peer, a practice commonly known as ``sexting''. \n        In most States, such conduct can subject young adults to felony \n        child pornography charges and the potential punishment of \n        registering as a sex offender.\n            (5) The Internet has facilitated the growth of a \n        multibillion dollar global market for child pornography, far \n        exceeding the capacity of law enforcement to respond at the \n        Federal, State, and local level.\n            (6) Internet safety education, coupled with technology \n        tools, is the most effective way to resolve and prevent these \n        crimes and other dangers committed on the Internet and in other \n        new media.\n            (7) According to an empirical study of 1,379 fourth grade \n        students in Virginia, the first State to mandate Internet \n        safety education in its schools, the students improved their \n        responses to 8 of 10 Internet safety scenarios after completing \n        an Internet safety education program, with the greatest \n        improvement in uncomfortable content and cyberbullying.\n            (8) The enactment of the Children's Internet Protection Act \n        (Public Law 106-554; 114 Stat. 2763A-336) mandated that schools \n        implement Internet safety policies and technology protection \n        measures in order to receive discounts to obtain affordable \n        telecommunications and Internet access. Most schools have now \n        developed acceptable use policies and have implemented \n        filtering and other technology-based solutions to help protect \n        children.\n            (9) However, less than 25 percent of educators feel \n        comfortable teaching students how to protect themselves from \n        online predators, bullies, and identity thieves, according to a \n        recent study by the National Cyber Security Alliance and \n        Educational Technology Policy, Research, and Outreach. The same \n        study found that 90 percent of educators have received less \n        than 6 hours of professional development on issues related to \n        online security in the past year. As a result, many students \n        receive little or no education on safe and responsible use of \n        the Internet and other new media.\n            (10) The widespread use of the Internet, cell phones, \n        interactive gaming, and other electronic communication devices \n        by children both inside and outside of schools suggests that \n        acceptable use policies and filtering alone cannot resolve \n        Internet safety concerns and that a greater focus on education \n        would be beneficial.\n            (11) In a national poll on children's health, parents \n        ranked Internet safety fifth among their top health concerns \n        for children. Yet according to a Common Sense Media poll \n        conducted in 2006, almost 90 percent of parents say that they \n        lack the knowledge about how to protect their children online. \n        For this reason, educating parents about Internet safety is key \n        to empowering them to understand actual risks and to take an \n        active role in protecting their children.\n            (12) The problem of online harassment, or cyberbullying, of \n        youth by other youths is widespread and results in a range of \n        children's experiences from minor irritation to severe \n        emotional harm. The Bureau of Justice Statistics has found that \n        online harassment tends to begin in third and fourth grade, \n        peaks in seventh and eighth grade, and continues in reduced \n        amounts throughout high school, college, and professional \n        school.\n            (13) Gang members increasingly are using the Internet as a \n        recruitment tool to entice would-be members and as an \n        intimidation tool to threaten rival gangs. Gang members use the \n        Internet, in particular, to promote their message.\n            (14) More research is needed in several areas of youth \n        online safety, including--\n                    (A) the prevention of minor-to-minor solicitation \n                and other inappropriate use of the Internet;\n                    (B) the prevention of the creation of problematic \n                content by youths;\n                    (C) the protection of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and \n                transgender youth and youth with disabilities that may \n                be particularly vulnerable;\n                    (D) the interplay between socioeconomic class and \n                risk factors;\n                    (E) the role that pervasive digital image and video \n                capture devices play in harassment of youth by other \n                youth and youth production of problematic content;\n                    (F) the intersection of different mobile and \n                Internet-based technologies; and\n                    (G) the online activities of registered sex \n                offenders.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) facilitate research and identify best practices in \n        Internet safety education for youth, parents, and education \n        officials; and\n            (2) establish a competitive grant program for State \n        education agencies, local educational agencies, and nonprofit \n        organizations to institute best practices relating to Internet \n        education and the research-based recommendations derived from \n        the study conducted under this Act.\n\nSEC. 3.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) a reliable source of groundwater is an essential \n        element of the economy of the communities on the High Plains;\n            (2) the High Plains Aquifer consists largely of the \n        Ogallala Aquifer with small components of other geologic units;\n            (3) the High Plains Aquifer experienced a dramatic decline \n        in water table levels in the latter half of the 20th century;\n            (4) the decline in water table levels is especially \n        pronounced in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer, with areas in the \n        States of Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas experiencing \n        declines of over 100 feet from 1950 to 2007;\n            (5)(A) the saturated thickness of the High Plains Aquifer \n        has declined by over 50 percent in some areas; and\n            (B) the percentage of the High Plains Aquifer that has a \n        saturated thickness of 100 feet or more declined from 54 \n        percent to 51 percent in the period from 1980 to 2007;\n            (6) the decreased water levels in the High Plains Aquifer \n        coupled with higher pumping lift costs raise concerns about the \n        long-term sustainability of irrigated agriculture in the High \n        Plains;\n            (7) hydrological modeling by the United States Geological \n        Survey indicates that in the context of sustained high \n        groundwater use in the surrounding region, reductions in \n        groundwater pumping at the single farm level or at a local \n        level of up to 100 square miles, have a very time-limited \n        impact on conserving the level of the local water table, thus \n        creating a disincentive for individual water users to invest in \n        water conservation measures;\n            (8) incentives must be created for conservation of \n        groundwater on a regional scale, in order to achieve an \n        agricultural economy on the High Plains that is sustainable; \n        and\n            (9) for water conservation incentives to function, Federal, \n        State, tribal, and local water policymakers, and individual \n        groundwater users must have access to reliable information \n        concerning aquifer recharge rates extraction rates, and water \n        table levels at the local and regional levels on an ongoing \n        basis.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to promote groundwater \nconservation on the High Plains in order to extend the useable life of \nthe High Plains Aquifer.\n\nSEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Contrary to the Weinberger Doctrine, which states that \n        the United States should use military force only if it is in \n        the vital national interest of the United States and only with \n        clearly defined political and military goals, the United States \n        went to war against Iraq in March 2003 without clearly defined \n        political and military goals.\n            (2) Contrary to the Powell Doctrine, which states that if \n        the United States is to use military force it should be \n        ``overwhelming'' military force, the United States went to war \n        against Iraq without the troop levels or strategy needed to \n        secure a post-invasion Iraq.\n            (3) Ignoring the advice of United States military leaders \n        and experts, the President sent United States troops into war \n        against Iraq without sufficient levels needed for post-conflict \n        success and without sufficient armor and related equipment, and \n        has used the United States military in such a way that today it \n        is straining under the weight of the war.\n            (4) The justifications cited by the President for using \n        military force against Iraq--that Iraq possessed weapons of \n        mass destruction and Iraq had links to al Qaeda--have not, to \n        date, been proven correct.\n            (5) On May 1, 2003, the President announced the end of \n        major combat operations in Iraq, thus starting an entirely new \n        phase--the occupation of Iraq.\n            (6) The justifications cited by the President for using \n        military force against Iraq have shifted dramatically since \n        Congress passed the Authorization for Use of Military Force \n        Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 (Public Law 107-243), from \n        combating the threat that Saddam Hussein allegedly posed to the \n        United States, to establishing an Iraqi democracy, and to a \n        larger vision of Middle Eastern democracy.\n            (7) Public Law 107-243 authorized the President to use \n        force to ``defend the national security of the United States \n        against the continuing threat posed by Iraq''.\n            (8) Currently, United States troops are not facing a \n        military force or direct threat to the United States in Iraq, \n        rather they are facing both a Sunni insurgency against the \n        United States occupation of Iraq and a violent, long-standing \n        struggle between Sunni and Shia Islam on the streets of \n        Baghdad--neither of which pose a ``continuing threat'' to the \n        United States.\n            (9) Public Law 107-243 clearly reflected the President's \n        policies of preemption and unilateralism that have left the \n        United States with an open-ended and ill-defined occupation of \n        a country in the middle of a civil war.\n            (10) The President's policies of preemption and \n        unilateralism that led the United States into Iraq now leave \n        the United States with no clear exit strategy from Iraq.\n            (11) The escalation of the use of military force in Iraq \n        continues the retreat from long-held United States policies of \n        diplomacy, deterrence, and containment.\n\nSEC. 2. REPEAL OF PUBLIC LAW 107-243.\n\n    The Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution \nof 2002 (Public Law 107-243) is hereby repealed.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) Congress should vote on a new authorization for use of \n        force resolution that--\n                    (A) reflects the current situation in Iraq;\n                    (B) abandons the Bush Doctrine of preemption and \n                unilateralism; and\n                    (C) realigns United States policy with its long-\n                held engagement priorities of diplomacy, deterrence, \n                and containment;\n            (2) the United States should establish a quick-reaction \n        United States military force with an over-the-horizon presence \n        in the region to respond as needed to imminent security threats \n        in the Middle East;\n            (3) the United States should enhance and intensify \n        diplomatic relations that will provide the proper external \n        environment and support for the difficult internal steps that \n        the Government of Iraq should take to promote national \n        reconciliation;\n            (4) the United States should increase efforts to engage all \n        neighboring countries and the League of Arab States in \n        promoting stability in Iraq;\n            (5) the United States should maintain its commitment to \n        continue to provide humanitarian and reconstruction assistance \n        in Iraq;\n            (6) the United States should redirect diplomatic, economic, \n        and military support to Afghanistan, where the Taliban \n        continues to destabilize the region; and\n            (7) the United States should aggressively pursue Osama Bin \n        Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, al Qaeda and other terrorist \n        organizations that continue to pose an imminent threat to the \n        United States.", "output": "Repeals P.L. 107-243 (Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002).\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress that: (1) Congress should vote on a new authorization for use of force resolution that reflects the current Iraq situation, abandons the Bush Doctrine of preemption and unilateralism, and realigns U.S. policy with its long-held priorities of diplomacy, deterrence, and containment; (2) the United States should establish a quick-reaction U.S. military force with an over-the-horizon presence in the region; (3) the United States should intensify diplomatic relations to support the difficult internal steps that the government of Iraq should take to promote national reconciliation; (4) the United States should increase efforts to engage all neighboring countries and the League of Arab States in promoting Iraq's stability; (5) the United States should continue to provide humanitarian and reconstruction assistance in Iraq; (6) the United States should redirect diplomatic, economic, and military support to Afghanistan; and (7) the United States should aggressively pursue Osama Bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations that continue to pose an imminent threat to the United States.", "category": "Summarization 751.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given text for US Congressional and California state bills, your task is to generate a summary for this bill.", "input": "SECTION 1.

Kennedy;\n            (6) in 1958, inspired by the establishment of the Cape \n        Hatteras National Seashore, a seashore park in the State of \n        North Carolina, Representative Tip O'Neill, along with his \n        close friend and colleague Representative Edward Boland, \n        introduced legislation to protect land on Cape Cod as a \n        national seashore;\n            (7) in describing the area on Cape Cod referred to in \n        paragraph (6), Henry David Thoreau wrote that ``[a] man may \n        stand there and put all America behind him'', as the pristine \n        sandy beach, marshes, ponds, and uplands supporting diverse \n        species represent a unique, cherished jewel of nature;\n            (8) the legislation referred to in paragraph (6) \n        established a 40-mile National Park along the outer beach of \n        Cape Cod, from the city of Chatham through the cities of \n        Orleans, Eastham, Wellfleet, Truro, and Provincetown, including \n        lighthouses, cultural landscapes, and wild cranberry bogs that \n        offer a glimpse of the past and continuing ways of life of Cape \n        Cod;\n            (9) after introducing the legislation referred to in \n        paragraph (6) in the 85th Congress, Tip O'Neill continued to \n        advocate strongly for the establishment of the Cape Cod \n        National Seashore, cosponsoring bills in the 86th and 87th \n        Congresses, testifying at hearings, and working to advance the \n        legislation through Congress;\n            (10) the legislation to establish the Cape Cod National \n        Seashore was intended to preserve one of the great natural \n        marvels of the United States, including the unbroken beach and \n        moors, marshes, forests, and freshwater ponds that are home to \n        many species of birds, fish, animals, and plants;\n            (11) on August 7, 1961, President Kennedy signed into law \n        Public Law 87-126, which authorized the establishment the Cape \n        Cod National Seashore;\n            (12) in 1966, the Cape Cod National Seashore was formally \n        established, and Representative O'Neill attended the May 30, \n        1966, ceremony inaugurating the Salt Pond Visitor Center;\n            (13) the Cape Cod National Seashore has become a national \n        treasure, with millions of Americans and visitors from around \n        the world enjoying the beauty and remarkable biodiversity of \n        the Cape Cod National Seashore;\n            (14) Tip O'Neill and his family maintained a home on Cape \n        Cod in Harwich Port, and he was a frequent visitor to the \n        National Seashore throughout his service in Congress and his \n        retirement;\n            (15) while a Member of Congress, Tip O'Neill rose quickly \n        through the leadership ranks due to his extraordinary political \n        skills, mastery of the legislative process, and sharp wit, \n        serving first as Majority Whip in the House of Representatives \n        beginning in 1971 and then, in 1973, as House Majority Leader;\n            (16) one of Tip O'Neill's greatest accomplishments as \n        Speaker was the crafting of a peace accord between warring \n        factions in Northern Ireland, during which he worked with \n        fellow Irish-American politicians, including Senator Edward M. \n        Kennedy, to develop the ``St. Patrick's Day declaration'', \n        which denounced violence in Northern Ireland and culminated \n        with the Irish aid package on the signing of the Anglo-Irish \n        Agreement in 1985;\n            (17) on January 3, 1987, Tip O'Neill retired from Congress, \n        having served in public life for 50 years, including 34 years \n        as a Member of Congress and 10 years as Speaker of the House, \n        the longest continuous term of any Speaker since the first \n        Congress met in 1789;\n            (18) Tip O'Neill's extraordinary record of public service \n        to the United States and tremendous accomplishments and \n        unmatched attention to the needs of his constituents led \n        President George H.W. Bush in 1991 to present Tip O'Neill with \n        the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award \n        in the United States; and\n            (19) it is fitting to recognize the support of Tip O'Neill \n        for the protection of the natural, historic, and cultural \n        resources of the National Parks of the State of Massachusetts.\n    (b) Designation.--The Salt Pond Visitor Center at Cape Cod National \nSeashore in Eastham, Massachusetts, is designated as the ``Thomas P. \nO'Neill, Jr. Salt Pond Visitor Center''.\n    (c) References.--Any reference to the Salt Pond Visitor Center at \nCape Cod National Seashore in any law, regulation, map, document, \nrecord, or other paper of the United States shall be considered to be a \nreference to the ``Thomas P.

The ability of police authorities to \n        coordinate, preempt, and act swiftly and in unison is an \n        essential element of crisis prevention and response.\n            (5) Taiwan maintained full membership in INTERPOL starting \n        in 1964 through its National Police Administration but was \n        ejected in 1984 when the People's Republic of China (PRC) \n        applied for membership.\n            (6) Nonmembership prevents Taiwan from gaining access to \n        INTERPOL's I-24/7 global police communications system, which \n        provides real-time information on criminals and global criminal \n        activities. Taiwan is relegated to second-hand information from \n        friendly nations, including the United States.\n            (7) Taiwan is unable to swiftly share information on \n        criminals and suspicious activity with the international \n        community, leaving a huge void in the global crime-fighting \n        efforts and leaving the entire world at risk.\n            (8) The United States, in the 1994 Taiwan Policy Review, \n        declared its intention to support Taiwan's participation in \n        appropriate international organizations and has consistently \n        reiterated that support.\n            (9) Following the enactment of Public Law 108-235, a law \n        authorizing the Secretary of State to initiate and implement a \n        plan to endorse and obtain observer status for Taiwan at the \n        annual summit of the World Health Assembly and subsequent \n        advocacy by the United States, Taiwan was granted observer \n        status to the World Health Assembly for six consecutive years \n        since 2009. Both prior to and in its capacity as an observer, \n        Taiwan has contributed significantly to the international \n        community's collective efforts in pandemic control, monitoring, \n        early warning, and other related matters.\n            (10) INTERPOL's constitution allows for observers at its \n        meetings by ``police bodies which are not members of the \n        Organization''.\n    (b) Taiwan's Participation in INTERPOL.--The President shall--\n            (1) develop a strategy to obtain observer status for Taiwan \n        in INTERPOL and at other related meetings, activities, and \n        mechanisms thereafter; and\n            (2) instruct INTERPOL Washington to officially request \n        observer status for Taiwan in INTERPOL and to actively urge \n        INTERPOL member states to support such observer status and \n        participation for Taiwan.\n    (c) Report Concerning Observer Status for Taiwan in INTERPOL.--Not \nlater than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the \nPresident shall transmit to Congress a report, in unclassified form, \ndescribing the United States strategy to endorse and obtain observer \nstatus for Taiwan in INTERPOL and at other related meetings, \nactivities, and mechanisms thereafter.

FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries \n        (OPEC), in its capacity as an oil cartel, has been a critical \n        factor in withholding production from the market and driving up \n        oil prices approximately 300 percent from January 1999 to June \n        2000.\n            (2) Nationwide, gasoline prices have increased \n        approximately 60 cents a gallon since the beginning of 1999 \n        with crude oil prices increasing 48 cents over this same time \n        period.\n            (3) The Department of Energy's weekly survey showed the \n        average cost of gasoline in the United States increased 5 cents \n        a gallon to $1.68 from the second to the third week of June \n        2000, a record high for a fourth week in a row.\n            (4) Price declines in the cost of oil in April 2000, \n        following the March 2000 OPEC meetings, have been reversed \n        because OPEC output did not meet global demand and supply \n        conditions.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Green Technology Promotion Act of \n1993''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The national policy of the United States declares that \n        pollution should be prevented or reduced at the source whenever \n        feasible, prior to environmentally sound recycling, treatment, \n        or landfilling.\n            (2) There are significant opportunities for industry to \n        reduce or prevent pollution at the source through cost-\n        effective changes in production, operation, and raw materials \n        use.\n            (3) Such changes offer industry substantial savings in \n        reduced raw material, pollution control, and liability costs, \n        and help to protect the environment and reduce risks to worker \n        health and safety.\n            (4) Federal Government estimates indicate that businesses \n        can reduce their waste generation 33 percent to 50 percent by \n        implementing source reduction techniques, and private sector \n        studies suggest that some industry sectors can reduce their \n        waste by up to 80 percent through the use of such techniques.\n            (5) In most cases, source reduction and energy efficiency \n        techniques do not require the purchase of new equipment, but \n        merely a better understanding of how to use equipment currently \n        available.\n            (6) In fact, one recent study indicated that 25 percent of \n        all source reduction activities require no capital investment \n        for implementation and, of those that require capital, 50 \n        percent of the capital expenditures were recouped in savings \n        in, on average, less than 18 months.\n            (7) The private sector must take the lead in reducing the \n        production of waste by manufacturing companies and, in fact, \n        many large companies have contracted with consultants or \n        performed internal audits to find methods for reducing \n        pollution in their own processes.\n            (8) Source reduction is fundamentally different from, and \n        more desirable than, waste management and pollution control and \n        should be promoted by Federal agencies, particularly the \n        Department of Commerce in its role in assisting businesses.\n            (9) The Federal Government can assist small- and medium-\n        sized companies that often are unaware of the techniques \n        available for pollution prevention and the possible savings \n        from employing them, and such Government assistance will help \n        meet the dual goals of modernizing manufacturing and improving \n        the environment.\n            (10) The Environmental Protection Agency and the Department \n        of Energy can provide the Manufacturing Technology Centers with \n        technical expertise in this area.\n            (11) The Environmental Protection Agency has conducted over \n        200 source reduction assessments for manufacturers and the \n        Department of Energy has conducted over 4,100 energy audits \n        which have saved companies $419 million and 77 trillion Btu's \n        of energy.\n            (12) Assisting small- and medium-sized companies to reduce \n        the waste products created during the manufacturing process \n        will reduce the companies' costs, and thus improve the \n        competitiveness of such companies, by--\n                    (A) reducing their costs of disposal;\n                    (B) reducing their costs of complying with \n                environmental regulations;\n                    (C) reducing their raw material costs;\n                    (D) reducing liability costs associated with \n                transport and disposal; and\n                    (E) assisting these companies in identifying areas \n                where their production processes are inefficient.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to incorporate \nenvironmental concerns into technology programs established in the \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology.\n\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Northern Cheyenne Lands Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Northern Cheyenne Tribe has depended on its lands \n        and land-based resources to support its way of life since time \n        immemorial.\n            (2) The Tribe has made supreme and historic sacrifices to \n        repossess and maintain its homeland, including its Reservation \n        in Montana.\n            (3) The Tribe currently suffers from tremendous social and \n        economic challenges, including a lack of employment \n        opportunities on the Reservation, which can be improved by \n        strengthening its control over its land base, natural \n        resources, and trust funds.\n            (4) The Tribe and its members are currently the beneficial \n        owners of over 95 percent of the surface lands on the Northern \n        Cheyenne Reservation and all but approximately 5,000 subsurface \n        acres of the Reservation.\n            (5) The Tribe seeks to obtain ownership of approximately \n        5,000 subsurface acres on its Reservation it does not own \n        because of an error by the United States to secure that \n        subsurface when the Reservation was expanded in 1900.\n            (6) In 2002, the Tribe agreed by settlement to dismiss its \n        lawsuit against the United States, which alleged that the \n        United States failed to protect the Reservation from the \n        impacts of coal development, in return for assistance in \n        securing tribal ownership of those subsurface rights \n        substantially in the form of this Act, and to secure mitigation \n        funding to address the impacts of coal development in areas \n        adjacent to the Reservation, among other conditions.\n            (7) To increase tribal ownership of the surface lands, the \n        Tribe has purchased approximately 932 acres of land within its \n        Reservation that were taken out of trust ownership status for \n        various reasons.\n            (8) The Tribe has purchased approximately 635 acres of land \n        near Bear Butte, South Dakota, which the Tribe considers sacred \n        ground for its members, as well as for members of other tribes.\n            (9) The Tribe now seeks to have the aforementioned lands \n        and subsurface within the Reservation and Bear Butte lands \n        taken into trust on its behalf by the United States.\n            (10) If the actions authorized by this Act are completed, \n        the Tribe will waive all legal claims against the United States \n        arising out of the longstanding loss of the subsurface rights \n        and arising out of the United States management of the Northern \n        Cheyenne Trust Fund.\n\nSEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) although prescription drugs represent one of the most \n        frequently used medical care interventions in treating common \n        acute and chronic diseases, many Americans, especially the \n        elderly and other vulnerable populations, are unable to afford \n        their medication because of excessive and persistent drug price \n        inflation;\n            (2) between 1985 and 1991, the prices of the 20 top selling \n        prescription drugs, which account for almost a third of \n        prescription sales, rose 79 percent--nearly 4 times the general \n        rate of inflation;\n            (3) prescription drug manufacturers continue to make \n        enormous profits on the backs of the elderly, poor, and other \n        vulnerable populations that are unable to afford their \n        medications;\n            (4) because of the limited availability of private or \n        public prescription drug coverage for the elderly, prescription \n        drugs represent the highest out-of-pocket medical care cost for \n        3 of 4 elderly patients, surpassed only by the cost of long-\n        term care services;\n            (5) individuals over the age of 65 fill an average of 15 \n        prescriptions a year to treat chronic health conditions \n        compared to an annual average of 5 prescriptions for those \n        under the age of 65;\n            (6) 90 percent of Americans who are 60 years of age or \n        older take one or more medications daily;\n            (7) The United States spends several billion dollars on \n        biomedical and related health research and in 1994 the United \n        States spent $33 billion on such research and the \n        pharmaceutical industry only spent $14 billion on such research \n        in such year; and\n            (8) The pharmaceutical industry makes large profits off of \n        the sale of drugs produced from the benefit of research paid \n        for by the United States and, aside from royalties, none of \n        such profits are reimbursed back to the United States \n        taxpayers.\n\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``American Missile Protection Act of \n1998''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The threat of weapons of mass destruction delivered by \n        long-range ballistic missiles is among the most serious \n        security issues facing the United States.\n                    (A) In a 1994 Executive Order, President Clinton \n                certified, that ``I ... find that the proliferation of \n                nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons (`weapons of \n                mass destruction') and the means of delivering such \n                weapons, constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat \n                to the national security, foreign policy, and economy \n                of the United States, and hereby declare a national \n                emergency to deal with that threat.'' This state of \n                emergency was reaffirmed in 1995, 1996, and 1997.\n                    (B) In 1994 the President stated, that ``there is \n                nothing more important to our security and the world's \n                stability than preventing the spread of nuclear weapons \n                and ballistic missiles''.\n                    (C) Several countries hostile to the United States \n                have been particularly determined to acquire missiles \n                and weapons of mass destruction. President Clinton \n                observed in January of 1998, for example, that ``Saddam \n                Hussein has spent the better part of this decade, and \n                much of his nation's wealth, not on providing for the \n                Iraqi people, but on developing nuclear, chemical and \n                biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them''.\n                    (D) In 1996, the Senate affirmed that, ``it is in \n                the supreme interest of the United States to defend \n                itself from the threat of limited ballistic missile \n                attack, whatever the source.''\n            (2) The long-range ballistic missile threat to the United \n        States is increasing.\n                    (A) Several adversaries of the United States have \n                stated their intention to acquire intercontinental \n                ballistic missiles capable of attacking the United \n                States.\n                            (i) Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi has \n                        stated, ``If they know that you have a \n                        deterrent force capable of hitting the United \n                        States, they would not be able to hit you. If \n                        we had possessed a deterrent--missiles that \n                        could reach New York--we would have hit it at \n                        the same moment. Consequently, we should build \n                        this force so that they and others will no \n                        longer think about an attack.''\n                            (ii) Abu Abbas, the head of the Palestine \n                        Liberation Front, has stated, ``I would love to \n                        be able to reach the American shore, but this \n                        is very difficult. Someday an Arab country will \n                        have ballistic missiles. Someday an Arab \n                        country will have a nuclear bomb. It is better \n                        for the United States and for Israel to reach \n                        peace with the Palestinians before that day.''\n                            (iii) Saddam Hussein has stated, ``Our \n                        missiles cannot reach Washington. If we could \n                        reach Washington, we would strike if the need \n                        arose.''\n                            (iv) Iranian actions speak for themselves. \n                        Iran's aggressive pursuit of medium-range \n                        ballistic missiles capable of striking Central \n                        Europe--aided by the continuing collaboration \n                        of outside agents--demonstrates Tehran's intent \n                        to acquire ballistic missiles of ever-\n                        increasing range.\n                    (B) Over 30 non-NATO countries possess ballistic \n                missiles, with at least 10 of those countries \n                developing over 20 new types of ballistic missiles.\n                    (C) From the end of World War II until 1980, \n                ballistic missiles were used in one conflict. Since \n                1980, thousands of ballistic missiles have been fired \n                in at least six different conflicts.\n                    (D) The clear trend among countries hostile to the \n                United States is toward having ballistic missiles of \n                greater range.\n                            (i) North Korea first acquired 300-\n                        kilometer range Scud Bs, then developed and \n                        deployed 500-kilometer range Scud Cs, is \n                        currently deploying the 1000-kilometer range \n                        No-Dong, and is developing the 2000-kilometer \n                        range Taepo-Dong 1 and 6000-kilometer range \n                        Taepo-Dong 2, which would be capable of \n                        striking Alaska and Hawaii.\n                            (ii) Iran acquired 150-kilometer range CSS-\n                        8s, progressed through the Scud B and Scud C, \n                        and is developing the 1300-kilometer range \n                        Shahab-3 and 2000-kilometer range Shahab-4, \n                        which would allow Iran to strike Central \n                        Europe.\n                            (iii) Iraq, in a two-year crash program, \n                        produced a new missile, the Al-Hussein, with \n                        twice the range of its Scud Bs.\n                            (iv) Experience gained from extending the \n                        range of short- and medium-range ballistic \n                        missiles facilitates the development of \n                        intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n                    (E) The technical information, hardware, and other \n                resources necessary to build ballistic missiles are \n                increasingly available and accessible worldwide.\n                            (i) Due to advances in information \n                        technology, a vast amount of technical \n                        information relating to ballistic missile \n                        design, much of it formerly classified, has \n                        become widely available and is increasingly \n                        accessible through the Internet and other \n                        distribution avenues.\n                            (ii) Components, tools, and materials to \n                        support ballistic missile development are \n                        increasingly available in the commercial \n                        aerospace industry.\n                            (iii) Increasing demand for satellite-based \n                        telecommunications is adding to the demand for \n                        commercial Space Launch Vehicles, which employ \n                        technology that is essentially identical to \n                        that of intercontinental ballistic missiles. As \n                        this increasing demand is met, the technology \n                        and expertise associated with space launch \n                        vehicles also proliferate.\n                    (F) Russia and China have provided significant \n                technical assistance to rogue nation ballistic missile \n                programs, accelerating the pace of those efforts. In \n                June of 1997, the Director of Central Intelligence, \n                reporting to Congress on weapons of mass destruction-\n                related equipment, materials, and technology, stated \n                that ``China and Russia continued to be the primary \n                suppliers, and are key to any future efforts to stem \n                the flow of dual-use goods and modern weapons to \n                countries of concern.''\n                    (G) Russia and China continue to engage in missile \n                proliferation.\n                            (i) Despite numerous Russian assurances not \n                        to assist Iran with its ballistic missile \n                        program, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of \n                        State for Nonproliferation testified to the \n                        Senate, that ``the problem is this: there is a \n                        disconnect between those reassurances, which we \n                        welcome, and what we believe is actually \n                        occurring.''\n                            (ii) Regarding China's actions to \n                        demonstrate the sincerity of its commitment to \n                        nonproliferation, the Director of Central \n                        Intelligence testified to the Senate on January \n                        28, 1998, that, ``the jury is still out on \n                        whether the recent changes are broad enough in \n                        scope and whether they will hold over the \n                        longer term. As such, Chinese activities in \n                        this area will require continued close \n                        watching.''\n                    (H) The inability of the United States to defend \n                itself against weapons of mass destruction delivered by \n                long-range ballistic missile provides additional \n                incentive for hostile nations to develop long-range \n                ballistic missiles with which to threaten the United \n                States. Missiles are widely viewed as valuable tools \n                for deterring and coercing a vulnerable United States.\n            (3) The ability of the United States to anticipate future \n        ballistic missile threats is questionable.\n                    (A) The Intelligence Community has failed to \n                anticipate many past technical innovations (for \n                example, Iraq's extended-range Al-Hussein missiles and \n                its development of a space launch vehicle) and outside \n                assistance enables rogue states to surmount traditional \n                technological obstacles to obtaining or developing \n                ballistic missiles of increasing range.\n                    (B) In June of 1997, the Director of Central \n                Intelligence reported to Congress that ``many Third \n                World countries--with Iran being the most prominent \n                example--are responding to Western counter-\n                proliferation efforts by relying more on legitimate \n                commercial firms as procurement fronts and by \n                developing more convoluted procurement networks.''\n                    (C) In June of 1997, the Director of Central \n                Intelligence stated to Congress that ``gaps and \n                uncertainties preclude a good projection of exactly \n                when `rest of the world' countries will deploy ICBMs.''\n                    (D) In 1997, the Director of Central Intelligence \n                testified that Iran would have a medium-range missile \n                by 2007. One year later the Director stated, ``since I \n                testified, Iran's success in getting technology and \n                materials from Russian companies, combined with recent \n                indigenous Iranian advances, means that it could have a \n                medium-range missile much sooner than I assessed last \n                year.'' Department of State officials have testified \n                that Iran could be prepared to deploy such a missile as \n                early as late 1998, nine years earlier than had been \n                predicted one year before by the Director of Central \n                Intelligence.\n            (4) The failure to prepare adequately for long-range \n        ballistic missile threats could have severe national security \n        and foreign policy consequences for the United States.\n                    (A) An attack on the United States by a ballistic \n                missile equipped with a weapon of mass destruction \n                could inflict catastrophic death or injury to citizens \n                of the United States and severe damage to their \n                property.\n                    (B) A rogue state's ability to threaten the United \n                States with an intercontinental ballistic missile may \n                constrain the United States' options in dealing with \n                regional threats to its interests, deter the United \n                States from taking appropriate action, or prompt allies \n                to question United States security guarantees, thereby \n                weakening alliances of the United States and the United \n                States' world leadership position.\n            (5) The United States must be prepared for rogue nations \n        acquiring long-range ballistic missiles armed with weapons of \n        mass destruction.\n                    (A) In its resolution of ratification for the START \n                II Treaty, the United States Senate declared that \n                ``because deterrence may be inadequate to protect the \n                United States against long-range ballistic missile \n                threats, missile defenses are a necessary part of new \n                deterrent strategies.''\n                    (B) In September of 1994, Secretary of Defense \n                Perry stated that in the post-Cold War era, ``we now \n                have opportunity to create a new relationship based not \n                on MAD, not on Mutual Assured Destruction, but rather \n                on another acronym, MAS, or Mutual Assured Safety.''\n                    (C) On February 12, 1997, the Under Secretary of \n                Defense for Policy testified to the Senate that ``I and \n                the administration are quite willing to acknowledge \n                that if we saw a rogue state, a potential proliferant, \n                beginning to develop a long-range ICBM capable of \n                reaching the United States, we would have to give very, \n                very serious attention to deploying a limited national \n                missile defense.''\n            (6) The United States has no defense deployed against \n        weapons of mass destruction delivered by long-range ballistic \n        missiles and no policy to deploy such a national missile \n        defense system.\n\nSEC. 3. NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE POLICY.\n\n    It is the policy of the United States to deploy as soon as is \ntechnologically possible an effective National Missile Defense system \ncapable of defending the territory of the United States against limited \nballistic missile attack (whether accidental, unauthorized, or \ndeliberate).", "output": "American Missile Protection Act of 1998 - States as U.S. policy to deploy as soon as technologically possible an effective National Missile Defense system capable of defending U.S. territory against limited ballistic missile attack (whether accidental, unauthorized, or deliberate).", "category": "Summarization 751.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given text for US Congressional and California state bills, your task is to generate a summary for this bill.", "input": "SECTION 1.

The map and legal description \nshall be on file and available for public inspection in the appropriate \noffices of the Forest Service.\n\nSEC. 4. ADMINISTRATION OF WILDERNESS AREAS.\n\n    (a) Covered Wilderness Areas.--In this section, the term ``covered \nwilderness area'' means--\n            (1) the National Forest System land included in the \n        Pajarita Wilderness by the amendment made by section 2(a); and\n            (2) the Tumacacori Highlands Wilderness designated by \n        section 3(a).\n    (b) Administration.--The Secretary of Agriculture shall manage the \ncovered wilderness area in accordance with the Wilderness Act (16 \nU.S.C. 1131 et seq.) and this section, except that, with respect to a \ncovered wilderness area, any reference in the Wilderness Act to the \neffective date of the Wilderness Act shall be deemed to be a reference \nto the date of the enactment of this Act.\n    (c) Valid Existing Rights.--Nothing in this section shall affect \nany valid existing right.\n    (d) Buffer Zones.--As provided in section 101(d) of the Arizona \nWilderness Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-406; 98 Stat. 1488), Congress \ndoes not intend that designation of a covered wilderness area lead to \nthe creation of protective perimeters or buffer zones around the \ncovered wilderness area. The fact that nonwilderness activities or uses \ncan be seen or heard from areas within a covered wilderness area shall \nnot, of itself, preclude such activities or uses up to the boundary of \nthe covered wilderness area.\n    (e) Grazing.--Grazing of livestock and maintenance of existing \nfacilities related to grazing in a covered wilderness area, where \nestablished before the date of the enactment of this Act, shall be \npermitted to continue in accordance with--\n            (1) section 4(d)(4) of the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. \n        1133(d)(4)); and\n            (2) the guidelines set forth in House Report 96-617 to \n        accompany H.R. 5487 of the 96th Congress.\n    (f) Hunting, Fish and Wildlife.--\n            (1) Hunting.--Nothing in this section or the Wilderness Act \n        (16 U.S.C. 1131 et seq.) shall affect hunting, under applicable \n        State and Federal laws and regulations, within a covered \n        wilderness area.\n            (2) Jurisdiction.--As provided in section 4(d)(7) of the \n        Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1133(d)(7)), nothing in this section \n        or the Wilderness Act shall be construed as affecting the \n        jurisdiction or responsibilities of the State of Arizona with \n        respect to fish and wildlife in the State.\n            (3) Wildlife management.--Management activities to maintain \n        or restore fish and wildlife populations and the habitats to \n        support such populations may be carried out within a covered \n        wilderness area, where consistent with the Wilderness Act (16 \n        U.S.C. 1131 et seq.) and other applicable laws.\n            (4) Cooperative agreement.--The Secretary shall enter into \n        a cooperative agreement with the State of Arizona for \n        management of fish and wildlife within a covered wilderness \n        area. The cooperative agreement shall specify the terms and \n        conditions under which the State or a designee of the State may \n        use wildlife management activities in a covered wilderness area \n        consistent with the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1131 et seq.), \n        and other applicable laws.\n    (g) Protection of Tribal Rights.--Nothing in this section shall be \nconstrued to diminish the existing rights of any Indian tribe. Nothing \nin this section shall be construed to diminish tribal rights regarding \naccess to Federal lands for tribal activities, including spiritual, \ncultural, and traditional food gathering activities.\n    (h) Military Activities.--Nothing in this section shall preclude \nlow level overflights of military aircraft, the designation of new \nunits of special airspace, or the use or establishment of military \nflight training routes over a covered wilderness area.\n    (i) Border Enforcement and Drug Interdiction.--Because of the \nproximity of the covered wilderness areas to the United States-Mexico \ninternational border, drug interdiction and border enforcement \noperations are common management actions throughout the area \nencompassing the covered wilderness areas. This Act recognizes the need \nto continue such management actions so long as such management actions \nare conducted in accordance with the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1131 et \nseq.) and existing inter-agency agreements.\n    (j) Maintenance of Existing Communications Facilities.--The \nprovisions of the Wilderness Act shall not be construed to prevent--\n            (1) the maintenance of communications facilities, in \n        existence on the date of the enactment of this Act and located \n        in a covered wilderness area; or\n            (2) limited motorized access to such facilities when \n        nonmotorized access means are not reasonably available or when \n        time is of the essence, subject to such conditions as the \n        Secretary of Agriculture considers to be desirable.", "output": "Tumacacori Highlands Wilderness Act - Amends the Arizona Wilderness Act of 1984 to include certain land in Pajarita Wilderness in Coronado National Forest.\n\nDesignates certain lands, in Arizona, in the Coronado National Forest as wilderness and as a component of the National Wilderness Preservation System, to be known as the \"Tumacacori Highlands Wilderness.\"", "category": "Summarization 751.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given text for US Congressional and California state bills, your task is to generate a summary for this bill.", "input": "SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps \nSanctions Implementation and Review Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has helped to \n        train and equip proxy groups and Iraqi Shiite insurgents, and \n        elements of the Taliban, which have targeted and killed United \n        States and other allied forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n            (2) The IRGC has provided Hezbollah, Hamas, and the \n        Palestinian Islamic Jihad with funding, training, and other \n        material support to conduct their terrorist activities and \n        missile attacks against Israel, in an effort to cause civilian \n        casualties and disrupt efforts for peace between Israel and its \n        neighbors, and to destabilize Lebanon.\n            (3) Iran has repeatedly been identified as the most active \n        state sponsor of terrorism by the Department of State, and the \n        IRGC, often operating through its Qods Force, is the principal \n        instrument for Iranian support for terror.\n            (4) The Government of Iran continues to engage in serious, \n        systematic, and ongoing violations of human rights, including \n        suppression of freedom of expression and religious freedom, \n        illegitimate detention, torture, and executions, without \n        affording anything resembling adequate due process.\n            (5) The IRGC plays a significant role in many of Iran's \n        human rights abuses.\n            (6) The IRGC currently dominates many sectors of the \n        Iranian economy, with a significant presence in Iran's \n        financial and commercial sectors and extensive economic \n        interests in the defense production, construction, and oil \n        industries, controlling billions of dollars in corporate \n        business.\n            (7) The IRGC operates through affiliated firms, front \n        companies, and foundations in order to serve its economic \n        interests and exert control over large segments of Iran's \n        economy.\n            (8) Many of the IRGC's personnel have been enriched through \n        control of these affiliated businesses and foundations, and \n        through corruption in the operation of the businesses and their \n        dealings with the Government of Iran.\n            (9) The IRGC has assisted the regime of Syrian President \n        Bashar al Assad by training, equipping, and aiding the regime's \n        security and military forces, through military advice, \n        provision of weapons, and funding.\n            (10) The United States Government designated the IRGC in \n        2007 under Executive Order 13382 for proliferation concerns \n        and, separately, the Qods Force under Executive Order 13224, \n        for its support for terrorist organizations.\n            (11) Section 104 of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, \n        Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 provided for \n        secondary sanctions against any financial institution that \n        handles a significant transaction for designated Iranian \n        entities, including the IRGC, its Qods Force, and other related \n        entities.\n            (12) Title III of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syrian \n        Human Rights Act of 2012 provided for additional secondary \n        sanctions against firms that conduct business of any kind with \n        the IRGC or related entities, and provided for the designation \n        of additional Iranians' entities related to the IRGC.\n            (13) The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action concerning \n        Iran's nuclear program does not require the United States to \n        lift or waive the sanctions against the IRGC or related \n        entities.\n            (14) On September 15, 2015, then Acting Undersecretary of \n        the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Adam \n        Szubin, stated that ``we are not providing any sanctions relief \n        to the IRGC, or to its Qods Force, or any of its officials or \n        subsidiaries'' and ``we will continue our campaign against the \n        IRGC and the Qods Force''.\n            (15) Strengthening sanctions against the IRGC, ensuring \n        that the United States Government identify and designate more \n        of the affiliated entities through which the IRGC operates, and \n        providing for additional secondary sanctions on firms that \n        assist the IRGC, will help deprive the IRGC of resources needed \n        to carry out its nefarious activities.\n\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Border Tax Equity Act of 2007''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS OF POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The United States largely relies on a direct tax \n        system, whereas 137 countries currently employ one particular \n        form of indirect tax known as value-added taxes (VAT) as well \n        as direct taxes. The worldwide VAT tax average in 2005 was 15.7 \n        percent, and in countries of the European Union it ranges \n        between 15 and 25 percent.\n            (2) Under the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO), \n        direct taxes, such as corporate income taxes, if rebated or \n        refunded upon the export of goods are viewed as export \n        subsidies and prohibited on most goods and are at least \n        potentially actionable on all goods. However, indirect taxes, \n        such as sales taxes and VAT, may be rebated or refunded upon \n        the export of goods and such rebate or refund is not defined as \n        constituting a subsidy and hence is not actionable under WTO \n        rules.\n            (3) At present, there are no WTO rules on subsidies as \n        applied to trade in services. However, a number of countries \n        currently impose taxes on the import of services and exempt or \n        rebate or refund taxes upon the export of services, to the \n        disadvantage of United States services providers.\n            (4) The disparate treatment of border taxes detrimentally \n        affects United States agricultural producers, manufacturers, \n        and service providers in that--\n                    (A) refunds of indirect taxes effectively act as \n                export subsidies to foreign exporters; and\n                    (B) United States exporters are subject to double \n                taxation, by paying direct taxes on domestic production \n                in the United States and having their exported product \n                or service face a border tax in the importing country \n                consisting of indirect taxes.\n            (5) The disparate treatment of border taxes results in a \n        large monetary disadvantage to United States exporters, \n        estimated to equal $93 billion on goods and $47 billion on \n        services. Moreover, since remission of VAT by foreign countries \n        equates to approximately $201 billion in export subsidies on \n        goods exported to the United States and another $38 billion on \n        services exported to the United States, United States \n        producers, in total, suffer an artificial disadvantage of up to \n        $294,000,000,000 on trade in goods and $85,000,000,000 on trade \n        in services.\n            (6) For more than 40 years, United States businesses have \n        complained of border tax inequity and, since 1968, prior United \n        States Administrations and Congresses have sought to resolve \n        it.\n            (7) Congress has repeatedly recognized the prejudicial \n        effect of the disparate treatment of border taxes with respect \n        to goods and has directed the United States to seek a \n        negotiated solution:\n                    (A) In passing the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. \n                2101 et seq.), Congress sought ``revision of GATT \n                articles with respect to the treatment of border \n                adjustments for international taxes to redress the \n                disadvantage to countries relying primarily on direct \n                rather than indirect taxes for revenue needs.''.\n                    (B) In section 1101(b)(16) of the Omnibus Trade and \n                Competitiveness Act of 1988 (19 U.S.C. 2901(b)(16) and \n                section 2102(b)(15) of Bipartisan Trade Promotion \n                Authority Act of 2002 (19 U.S.C. 3802(b)(15)), Congress \n                declared that a principal trade negotiating objective \n                of the United States is to obtain a revision of WTO \n                rules with respect to the treatment of border taxes in \n                order to redress the disadvantage to countries relying \n                primarily on direct taxes for revenue rather than \n                indirect taxes.\n            (8) The disparate treatment of border taxes is arbitrary, \n        inequitable, causes economic distortions based only on the type \n        of tax system used by a country, and is a primary obstacle to \n        more balanced trade relations between the United States and its \n        major trading partners.\n    (b) Declarations of Policy.--Congress declares the following:\n            (1) It is critically necessary that the issue of border \n        taxes be addressed and resolved in WTO negotiations, whether in \n        the ongoing Doha Development Round of WTO negotiations or \n        subsequent WTO negotiations.\n            (2) If such WTO negotiations fail to achieve the United \n        States trade negotiating objective of revising WTO rules with \n        respect to the treatment of border taxes in order to redress \n        the disadvantage to countries relying primarily on direct taxes \n        for revenue rather than indirect taxes, then effective action \n        through legislation is warranted given the massive and \n        inequitable distortions to trade that United States \n        agricultural producers, manufacturers, and service providers \n        face as a result of border taxes.\n\nSEC. 3. REPORT ON RESULTS OF WTO NEGOTIATIONS TO REVISE WTO RULES \n              REGARDING BORDER TAXES.\n\n    (a) Report Required.--Not later than 60 days after the completion \nof WTO negotiations, or by January 1, 2009, whichever occurs first, the \nUnited States Trade Representative shall submit to Congress a report \ncertifying whether or not each of the United States trade negotiating \nobjectives regarding border tax treatment, as specified in subsection \n(b), has been met as a result of such negotiations.\n    (b) U.S. Trade Negotiating Objectives Regarding Border Tax \nTreatment Specified.--The United States trade negotiating objectives \nregarding border tax treatment specified in this subsection are the \nfollowing:\n            (1) With respect to trade in goods, the revision of WTO \n        rules with respect to the treatment of border adjustments for \n        internal taxes to redress the disadvantage to countries relying \n        primarily on direct taxes for revenue rather than indirect \n        taxes, as provided for in section 2102(b)(15) of Bipartisan \n        Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 (19 U.S.C. 3802(b)(15)).\n            (2) With respect to trade in services--\n                    (A) the elimination of the disadvantage in trade in \n                services that exists for countries relying primarily on \n                direct taxes that are not adjusted at the border rather \n                than indirect taxes that are adjusted at the border; \n                and\n                    (B) the revision of WTO rules regarding trade in \n                services to ensure that such rules do not result in \n                disparate treatment of border adjustments for internal \n                taxes based on the direct or indirect nature of such \n                taxes.\n    (c) Definition.--In this section, the terms ``WTO negotiations'' \nand ``negotiations'' mean the ongoing Doha Development Round of World \nTrade Organization negotiations or subsequent WTO negotiations that may \nresult in revisions to WTO rules to meet the United States trade \nnegotiating objectives regarding border tax treatment, as specified in \nsubsection (b).\n\nSEC. 4.

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Approximately 51 percent of the world's population \n        currently lives in cities of all sizes and produces the \n        majority of the world's economic output.\n            (2) Approximately one billion people currently live in \n        slums, and more than half of this population is under the age \n        of 25.\n            (3) It is estimated that by 2030 the number of people \n        living in slums will double.\n            (4) Slums are characterized by inadequate access to safe \n        water, sanitation, and other essential infrastructure, \n        overcrowding, poorly structured housing, and insecure \n        residential and property ownership status.\n            (5) Eighty-eight percent of all disease is caused by unsafe \n        drinking water, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene and \n        almost 50 percent of all people in developing countries suffer \n        health problems caused by water and sanitation deficits.\n            (6) Over 1.1 billion people lack adequate access to safe \n        water and nearly 2.5 billion lack access to sanitation \n        services.\n            (7) The costs of diseases and productivity losses linked to \n        water and sanitation in less developed countries amount to two \n        percent of gross domestic product and up to five percent in \n        sub-Saharan Africa.\n            (8) Insecure lease and real property ownership tenure often \n        subject slum dwellers to arbitrary, often supra-market rents, \n        forced evictions, threats, and harassment.\n            (9) In 2007, approximately five million people were subject \n        to forced evictions, and projections show that the number of \n        forced evictions are likely to increase to between 40 million \n        and 70 million in the next 20 years.\n            (10) Insecurity of tenure severely inhibits economic \n        development by undermining investment incentives and \n        constraining the growth of credit markets, imperils the ability \n        of families to achieve sustainable livelihoods and assured \n        access to shelter, and often contributes to conflict over \n        property rights.\n            (11) Women make up 66 percent of the world's work force, \n        but own less than 15 percent of the property globally.\n            (12) Women are affected disproportionally by forced \n        evictions and insecure tenure as a result of gender \n        discrimination, often including gender-biased laws that define \n        women as legal minors or otherwise prevent them from acquiring \n        and securing land, property, and housing lease or ownership \n        rights, making them more vulnerable to poverty, violence, and \n        sexual abuse.\n            (13) Adequate housing and universal access to basic shelter \n        serve as catalysts for social and democratic development.\n            (14) The 2006 National Security Strategy states, \n        ``America's national interests and moral values drive us in the \n        same direction: to assist the world's poor citizens and least \n        developed nations and help integrate them into the global \n        economy.''.\n            (15) Goal 7 Target 11 of the Millennium Development Goals \n        sets the target that ``By 2020, to have achieved a significant \n        improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum-\n        dwellers.''.\n            (16) The United States formerly provided significant levels \n        of overseas development assistance for shelter and affordable \n        housing, but in recent years this amount has declined.\n\nSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n    It should be the policy of the United States--\n            (1) to establish and implement, as a major objective of \n        United States overseas development assistance strategy, \n        particularly in developing countries, programs that foster \n        improved urban management, that foster sustainable urban \n        development, that increase the security of real property \n        tenure, and that expand access to basic shelter, affordable \n        urban housing, and essential urban services and infrastructure, \n        particularly by the poor and others who lack such access in \n        whole or in part;\n            (2) to allocate increased levels of United States bilateral \n        assistance for programs described in paragraph (1); and\n            (3) in order to prevent waste and duplication in the use of \n        United States overseas development assistance with respect to \n        the programs described in paragraph (1) and in order to foster \n        cooperative relations with foreign governments, \n        intergovernmental organizations, and private business and \n        nonprofit entities that singly or jointly support or implement \n        programs similar to those described in paragraph (1), to seek \n        and actively support innovative international mechanisms \n        designed to increase coordination and mutual complementarity in \n        the planning, financing, and implementation of sustainable \n        urban development policies and programs implemented by the \n        United States and other donors described in this paragraph.\n\nSEC. 4.

FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Infantile autism and autism spectrum disorders are \n        biologically-based neurodevelopmental diseases that cause \n        severe impairments in language and communication and generally \n        manifest in young children sometime during the first two years \n        of life.\n            (2) Best estimates indicate that 1 in 500 children born \n        today will be diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder and \n        that 400,000 Americans have autism or an autism spectrum \n        disorder.\n            (3) Three quarters of those with infantile autism spend \n        their adult lives in institutions or group homes, and usually \n        enter institutions by the age of 13.\n            (4) The cost of caring for individuals with autism and \n        autism spectrum disorder is great, and is estimated to be $13.3 \n        billion per year solely for direct costs.\n            (5) The rapid advancements in biomedical science suggest \n        that effective treatments and a cure for autism are attainable \n        if--\n                    (A) there is appropriate coordination of the \n                efforts of the various agencies of the Federal \n                Government involved in biomedical research on autism \n                and autism spectrum disorders;\n                    (B) there is an increased understanding of autism \n                and autism spectrum disorders by the scientific and \n                medical communities involved in autism research and \n                treatment; and\n                    (C) sufficient funds are allocated to research.\n            (6) Specifically, more knowledge is needed concerning--\n                    (A) the underlying causes of autism and autism \n                spectrum disorders, how to treat the underlying \n                abnormality or abnormalities causing the severe \n                symptoms of autism, and how to prevent these \n                abnormalities from occurring in the future;\n                    (B) the epidemiology of, and the identification of \n                risk factors for, infantile autism and autism spectrum \n                disorders;\n                    (C) the development of methods for early medical \n                diagnosis and functional assessment of individuals with \n                autism and autism spectrum disorders, including \n                identification and assessment of the subtypes within \n                the autism spectrum disorders, for the purpose of \n                monitoring the course of the disease and developing \n                medically sound strategies for improving the outcomes \n                of such individuals;\n                    (D) existing biomedical and diagnostic data that \n                are relevant to autism and autism spectrum disorders \n                for dissemination to medical personnel, particularly \n                pediatricians, to aid in the early diagnosis and \n                treatment of this disease; and\n                    (E) the costs incurred in educating and caring for \n                individuals with autism and autism spectrum disorders.\n            (7) In 1998, the National Institutes of Health announced a \n        program of research on autism and autism spectrum disorders.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n     This Act may be cited as the ``Housing Preservation Matching Grant \nAct of 2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) more than 55,300 affordable housing dwelling units in \n        the United States have been lost through termination of low \n        income affordability requirements, which usually involves the \n        prepayment of the outstanding principal balance under the \n        mortgage on the project in which such units are located;\n            (2) more than 265,000 affordable housing dwelling units in \n        the United States are currently at risk of prepayment;\n            (3) the loss of the privately owned, federally assisted \n        affordable housing, which is occurring during a period when \n        rents for unassisted housing are increasing and few units of \n        additional affordable housing are being developed, will cause \n        unacceptable harm on current tenants of affordable housing and \n        will precipitate a national crisis in the supply of housing for \n        low-income households;\n            (4) the demand for affordable housing far exceeds the \n        supply of such housing, as evidenced by studies in 1998 that \n        found that--\n                    (A) 5,300,000 households (one-seventh of all \n                renters in the Nation) have worst-case housing needs; \n                and\n                    (B) the number of families with at least one full-\n                time worker and having worst-case housing needs \n                increased from 1991 to 1995 by 265,000 (24 percent) to \n                almost 1,400,000;\n            (5) the shortage of affordable housing in the United States \n        reached a record high in 1995, when the number of low-income \n        households exceeded the number of low-cost rental dwelling \n        units by 4,400,000;\n            (6) between 1990 and 1995, the shortage of affordable \n        housing in the United States increased by 1,000,000 dwelling \n        units, as the supply of low-cost units decreased by 100,000 and \n        the number of low-income renter households increased by \n        900,000;\n            (7) there are nearly 2 low-income renters in the United \n        States for every low-cost rental dwelling unit;\n            (8) 2 of every 3 low-income renters receive no housing \n        assistance and about 2,000,000 low-income households remain on \n        waiting lists for affordable housing;\n            (9) the shortage of affordable housing dwelling units \n        results in low-income households that are not able to acquire \n        low-cost rental units paying large proportions of their incomes \n        for rent; and\n            (10) in 1995, 82 percent of low-income renter households \n        were paying more than 30 percent of their incomes for rent and \n        utilities.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act--\n            (1) to promote the preservation of affordable housing units \n        by providing matching grants to States that have developed and \n        funded programs for the preservation of privately owned housing \n        that is affordable to low-income families and persons and was \n        produced for such purpose with Federal assistance;\n            (2) to minimize the involuntary displacement of tenants who \n        are currently residing in such housing, many of whom are \n        elderly or disabled persons; and\n            (3) to continue the partnerships among the Federal \n        Government, State and local governments, and the private sector \n        in operating and assisting housing that is affordable to low-\n        income Americans.\n\nSEC. 3.

Authorizes the Attorney General to award grants to establish or expand: (1) veterans treatment court programs, which involve collaboration among criminal justice, veterans, and mental health and substance abuse agencies to provide qualified veterans (preliminarily qualified offenders who were discharged from the armed forces under conditions other than dishonorable) with intensive judicial supervision and case management, treatment services, alternatives to incarceration, and other appropriate services, including housing, transportation, job training, education, and assistance in obtaining benefits; (2) peer to peer services or programs to assist such veterans in obtaining treatment, recovery, stabilization, or rehabilitation; (3) practices that identify and provide treatment, rehabilitation, legal, transitional, and other appropriate services to such veterans who have been incarcerated; and (4) training programs to teach criminal justice, law enforcement, corrections, mental health, and substance abuse personnel how to identify and respond to incidents involving such veterans. Revises the definition of \"preliminarily qualified offender\" to include, in the case of a veterans treatment court program, an adult or juvenile accused of an offense who has been diagnosed with, or manifests obvious signs of, mental illness or a substance abuse disorder or co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse disorder. Removes a requirement that the adult or juvenile be accused of a nonviolent offense. Requires preliminarily qualified offenders to be unanimously approved for participation in a collaboration program by, when appropriate, the relevant prosecuting attorney, defense attorney, probation or corrections official, judge, and representative from the relevant mental health agency.

Rather than having schools \n        and local educational agencies apply digital learning \n        innovations designed for urban environments to rural areas, it \n        is important that digital learning technologies be developed \n        and implemented in ways that reflect the unique needs of rural \n        areas.\n            (4) Digital learning is rapidly expanding, and new tools \n        for improving teaching and learning are being developed every \n        day. A growing demand for digital learning tools and products \n        has made rigorous evaluation of their effectiveness \n        increasingly important, as this information would allow school \n        and local educational agency leaders to make informed choices \n        about how best to use these tools to improve student \n        achievement and educational outcomes.\n            (5) High-quality digital learning increases student access \n        to courses that may not have been available to students in \n        rural communities, increasing their college and career \n        readiness.\n\nSEC. 3. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED.\n\n    (a) Grants to Eligible Partnerships.--From the amounts appropriated \nto carry out this Act, the Secretary of Education is authorized to \naward grants, on a competitive basis, to eligible partnerships to carry \nout the activities described in section 6.\n    (b) Duration of Grant.--A grant under subsection (a) shall be \nawarded for not less than a 3-year and not longer than a 5-year period.\n    (c) Fiscal Agent.--If an eligible partnership receives a grant \nunder this Act, a school partner in the partnership shall serve as the \nfiscal agent for the partnership.\n\nSEC. 4.

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that--\n            (1) the defects in the United States civil justice system \n        have a direct and undesirable effect on interstate commerce by \n        decreasing the availability of goods and services in commerce;\n            (2) the spiraling costs of litigation and the magnitude and \n        unpredictability of punitive damage awards and noneconomic \n        damage awards have continued unabated for at least the past 30 \n        years;\n            (3) the Supreme Court of the United States has recognized \n        that a punitive damage award can be unconstitutional if the \n        award is grossly excessive in relation to the legitimate \n        interest of the government in the punishment and deterrence of \n        unlawful conduct;\n            (4) just as punitive damage awards can be grossly \n        excessive, so can it be grossly excessive in some circumstances \n        for a party to be held responsible under the doctrine of joint \n        and several liability for damages that party did not cause;\n            (5) as a result of joint and several liability, entities \n        including small businesses are often brought into litigation \n        despite the fact that their conduct may have little or nothing \n        to do with the accident or transaction giving rise to the \n        lawsuit, and may therefore face increased and unjust costs due \n        to the possibility or result of unfair and disproportionate \n        damage awards;\n            (6) due to high liability costs and unwarranted litigation \n        costs, small businesses face higher costs in purchasing \n        insurance through interstate insurance markets to cover their \n        activities; and\n            (7) legislation to address these concerns is an appropriate \n        exercise of the powers of Congress under clauses 3, 9, and 18 \n        of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the United \n        States, and the 14th amendment to the Constitution of the \n        United States.\n\nSEC. 3.

Empowers the SEC to define such \"qualified purchasers.\" \nSets forth conditions under which certain economic, business, and industrial development companies that are already subject to regulation by the State in which they are organized are exempt from the regulatory constraints of such Act. \nIncreases to $10 million the maximum aggregate amount of proceeds that certain interstate closed-end investment companies may receive from the sale of their outstanding securities and still retain their exempt status under such Act. \nExpands the definition of \"eligible portfolio company\" to include any company which does not have total assets in excess of $4 million and capital and surpluses in excess of $2 million. \nDeclares that a \"business development company\" is not required to make available significant managerial assistance with respect to any eligible portfolio company or any other company that meets certain SEC criteria. \nPermits a business development company to:  (1) acquire the securities of an eligible portfolio company from persons other than such portfolio company itself; (2) issue multiple classes of debt without restriction; and (3) issue warrants, options, or rights to subscribe or convert to or purchase voting securities either alone or accompanied by debt or equity securities. \nProvides conditions under which a business development company may: \n(1) have a minimum asset coverage of 110 percent; and (2) issue or sell any class of senior security representing indebtedness. \nRequires a business development company to file with the SEC a written evaluation of the risk factors involved in investment due to the nature of the company's capital structure.", "category": "Summarization 751.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given text for US Congressional and California state bills, your task is to generate a summary for this bill.", "input": "SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Oil Price Reduction Act of 2000''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Oil producing countries, including the nations of the \n        Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), took \n        concerted actions in March and September of 1999 to cut oil \n        production and hold back from the market 4,000,000 barrels a \n        day representing approximately six percent of the global \n        supply.\n            (2) OPEC, in its capacity as an oil cartel, has been a \n        critical factor in driving prices from approximately $11 a \n        barrel in December 1998 to a high of $30 a barrel in mid-\n        February 2000, levels not seen since the Persian Gulf Conflict.\n            (3) On February 10, 2000, a hearing before the Committee on \n        International Relations of the House of Representatives on \n        ``OPEC and the Northeast Energy Crisis'' clearly demonstrated \n        that OPEC's goal of reducing its oil stocks was the major \n        reason behind price increases in heating oil, gasoline, and \n        diesel oil stocks.\n            (4) During this hearing, the Assistant Secretary in the \n        Office of International Affairs of the Department of Energy \n        noted that artificial supply constraints placed on the market \n        are ultimately self-defeating in so far as they increase \n        volatility in the market, lead to boom and bust cycles, and \n        promote global instability, particularly in developing \n        countries whose economies are extremely vulnerable to sharp \n        price increases.\n            (5) These price increases have caused inflationary shocks \n        to the United States economy and could threaten the global \n        economic recovery now underway in Europe and Asia where the \n        demand for oil is rising.\n            (6) The transportation infrastructure of the United States \n        is under stress and tens of thousands of small- to medium-sized \n        trucking firms throughout the Northeast region are on the verge \n        of bankruptcy because of the rise in diesel oil prices to more \n        than $2 per gallon--a 43 percent increase in the Central \n        Atlantic region and a 55 percent increase in the New England \n        region--an increase that has had the effect of requiring these \n        trucking firms to use up to 20 percent of their operating \n        budgets for the purchase of diesel oil.\n            (7) Many elderly and retired Americans on fixed incomes \n        throughout the Northeast region of the United States cannot \n        afford to pay the prevailing heating oil costs and all too \n        often are faced with the choice of paying the grocery bills or \n        staying warm.\n            (8) Several key oil producing nations relied on the United \n        States military for their protection in 1990 and 1991, \n        including during the Persian Gulf Conflict, and these nations \n        still depend on the United States for their security.\n            (9) Many of these nations enjoy a close economic and \n        security relationship with the United States which is a \n        fundamental underpinning of global security and cooperation.\n            (10) A continuation of the present policies put in place at \n        the meeting of OPEC Ministers in March and September of 1999 \n        threatens the relationship that many of the OPEC nations enjoy \n        with the United States.\n\nSEC. 3. POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\n    (a) Policy With Respect to Oil Exporting Countries.--It shall be \nthe policy of the United States to consider the extent to which major \nnet oil exporting countries engage in oil price fixing to be an \nimportant determinant in the overall political, economic, and security \nrelationship between the United States and these countries.\n    (b) Policy With Respect to Oil Importing Countries.--It shall be \nthe policy of the United States to work multilaterally with other \ncountries that are major net oil importers to bring about the complete \ndismantlement of international oil price fixing arrangements.\n\nSEC. 4.

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) On August 4, 1995, the Senate voted 67-27 to impose a \n        moratorium on United States use of anti-personnel landmines \n        beginning in February 1999.\n            (2) On April 3, 1996, 15 senior retired United States \n        military officers, including the former commanding officers of \n        United States Armed Forces in Korea, the North Atlantic Treaty \n        Organization (NATO), Vietnam, and Desert Storm, urged the \n        President to ban the production, stockpiling, sale, and use of \n        anti-personnel landmines.\n            (3) The generals stated that a ban would be ``humane and \n        militarily responsible'' and that it ``would not undermine the \n        military effectiveness or safety of our forces, nor those of \n        other nations''.\n            (4) In Vietnam, 7,318 United States military personnel were \n        killed, and 56,783 were injured, from landmines.\n            (5) In Bosnia, at least 204 soldiers under United Nations \n        command have been injured, and 20 killed, and at least 55 \n        soldiers under NATO command have been injured, and 9 killed, by \n        landmines.\n            (6) The Department of State estimates that a man, woman, or \n        child is killed or injured by a landmine every 22 minutes.\n            (7) On May 16, 1996, President Clinton declared that the \n        United States would ``aggressively pursue'' an international \nagreement to ban anti-personnel landmines.\n            (8) On June 7, 1996, the members of the Organization of \n        American States, including the United States, declared the goal \n        of a Western Hemisphere landmine free zone.\n            (9) On June 4, 1997, the members of the Organization of \n        African Unity adopted the goal of the establishment of Africa \n        as an anti-personnel landmine free zone.\n            (10) On October 5, 1996, the Government of Canada announced \n        that it would pursue negotiations on a treaty banning anti-\n        personnel landmines to be completed at Ottawa in December 1997.\n            (11) On December 10, 1996, the United Nations General \n        Assembly passed by a vote of 156-0 (with 10 abstentions), a \n        United States-sponsored resolution to ``pursue vigorously'' a \n        treaty banning the use, stockpiling, production, and transfer \n        of anti-personnel landmines, with a view to completing the \n        negotiation ``as soon as possible''.\n            (12) Formal negotiations on the Ottawa treaty began in \n        Oslo, Norway on September 1, 1997, with a moment of silence in \n        memory of Diana, Princess of Wales, who was a passionate \n        advocate for a total ban on anti-personnel landmines.\n            (13) By exerting its unmatched international influence, the \n        United States could secure broad support for a legally binding \n        international treaty banning anti-personnel landmines.\n            (14) Such a treaty would further United States security and \n        humanitarian interests by deterring the use of anti-personnel \n        landmines against United States Armed Forces and civilians.\n\nSEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al-Nahyan is the brother of \n        United Arab Emirates (hereinafter in this section referred to \n        as ``UAE'') president and Abu Dhabi Emir Sheikh Khalifa bin \n        Zayed al-Nahayan.\n            (2) On April 22, 2009, ABC Nightline broadcast a few \n        minutes of videotape documenting the severest forms of torture \n        and abuse of an Afghan grain dealer, Mohammed Shah Poor, \n        inflicted by Sheikh Issa assisted by other uniformed \n        individuals acting under color of authority.\n            (3) During Mr. Poor's ordeal, Sheikh Issa repeatedly \n        insisted that his and his cronies actions be videotaped, \n        reportedly for his later enjoyment of the extreme suffering of \n        his victim, who miraculously survived the attack.\n            (4) Excerpts of this video have been circulated on YouTube \n        and longer footage was submitted in a United States civil court \n        in 2009.\n            (5) Around 2004, the matter was brought to the attention of \n        the UAE Ministry of Interior, which is headed by another of \n        Sheikh Issa's brothers. The Interior Ministry failed to \n        investigate this matter, and when ABC News brought it again to \n        their attention, the Ministry replied that the incidents were \n        not part of a pattern of behavior and that the police had \n        correctly followed procedures.\n            (6) Human Rights Watch stated, regarding this incident: \n        ``The UAE government's failure to prosecute those involved in \n        this undisputed incident of torture and abuse at the hands of a \n        royal family member and the police is an appalling miscarriage \n        of justice. What's even more shocking is the government's \n        insistence that it investigated and found no violation of UAE \n        laws.''.\n            (7) Only after an international outcry regarding the lack \n        of action by UAE law enforcement and legal authorities and a \n        hearing of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission in the U.S. \n        House of Representatives on Wednesday, May 13, 2009, did Sheikh \n        Issa finally have to face charges before a UAE court.\n            (8) On January 10, 2010, the UAE court acquitted Sheikh \n        Issa of the charges of rape, endangering life and causing \n        bodily harm. According to Sheikh Issa's attorney, the court \n        accepted their defense that Sheikh Issa had been under the \n        influence of drugs.\n            (9) In addition, the UAE court convicted Bassam and Ghassan \n        Nabulsi, sentenced in absentia to five years each in prison. \n        Bassam and Ghassan Nabulsi were former business partners of \n        Sheikh Issa, who had filmed the attack and kept the video tape \n        and ultimately brought a civil suit in the United States \n        against Sheikh Issa during which they submitted the film.\n\nSEC. 3.

(Crowdfunding is a method of capital formation in which groups of people pool money to invest in a company or to support an effort to accomplish a specific goal.) A \"crowdfunding vehicle\" is defined as a company that:  has purposes limited to acquiring, holding, and disposing only one class of crowdfunding securities issued by a single company;  receives no compensation for doing so; and  meets&nbsp;other specified requirements, including those&nbsp;related to reporting obligations and the use of investment advisers.  The bill amends the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to provide for the registration of crowdfunding vehicle advisers.  The bill amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to revise the conditions upon which the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shall exempt securities issued in crowdfunding transactions from registration requirements. Under current law, holders of crowdfunded shares do not count toward the shareholder threshold beyond which an issuer is required to register its securities with the SEC, provided that the issuer: (1) is current in its annual reporting obligations, (2) retains the services of a registered transfer agent, and (3) has less than $25 million in assets. The bill maintains this exemption but alters the&nbsp;conditions upon which it applies. Specifically, holders of crowdfunded shares shall not count toward the shareholder threshold if the issuer has: (1)&nbsp;a public float of less than $75 million, or (2) a public float&nbsp;of $0 and annual revenues of less than $50 million.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Digital Goods and Services Tax \nFairness Act of 2010''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Consumers, businesses, and other participants engaged \n        in electronic commerce may be subject to multiple, confusing, \n        and burdensome taxation because of inconsistent rules among \n        thousands of State and local jurisdictions and disparate \n        treatment of digital goods and digital services.\n            (2) A consistent framework for taxation is needed that will \n        not impede electronic commerce and the sale of digital goods \n        and digital services, by preventing multiple taxation, and \n        providing greater certainty and simplicity.\n            (3) Neutrality should guide tax policy and administration \n        in this area. Transactions involving similar types of goods and \n        services should be taxed fairly, regardless of the method and \n        means of distribution, whether through electronic transfer or \n        through other channels of commerce. New or different taxes on \n        electronic transactions should be barred.\n            (4) To ensure neutrality and avoid multiple taxation, \n        certain rules should be adapted to reflect the unique nature of \n        electronic commerce and how digital goods and digital services \n        are provided.\n            (5) To recognize the critical role that online health, \n        energy management, and education services will play in our \n        economy, these services should be exempt from all State and \n        local taxes.\n\nSEC. 3. MULTIPLE AND DISCRIMINATORY TAXES PROHIBITED.\n\n    No State or local jurisdiction shall impose multiple or \ndiscriminatory taxes on or with respect to the sale or use of digital \ngoods or digital services.\n\nSEC. 4. RETAIL, SOURCING, AND OTHER LIMITATIONS.\n\n    (a) Retail Limitation.--Taxes on or with respect to the sale or use \nof digital goods or digital services may be imposed only on or with \nrespect to a sale to, or use by, a customer.\n    (b) Sourcing Limitation.--\n            (1) In general.--Taxes on or with respect to the sale or \n        use of digital goods or digital services may be imposed only by \n        the State and local jurisdictions whose territorial limits \n        encompass the customer's tax address.

DEFINITIONS AND OTHER SPECIAL RULES.\n\n    For the purposes of this Act, the following definitions and rules \napply:\n            (1) Customer.--The term ``customer'' means a person that \n        purchases a digital good or digital service, for a purpose \n        other than resale. For the purpose of determining a place of \n        primary use under section 4(b)(2)(A), ``customer'' means the \n        ``end user'', as such term is used in section 124 of title 4 of \n        the United States Code, of the purchased digital good or \n        digital service.

Redefines single asset real estate to exclude family farms, and to increase from $4 million to $15 million the ceiling on the amount of noncontingent, liquidated secured debts on such property.  Defines the term \"transfer\" to include:  (1) creation of a lien; (2) retention of title as a security interest; (3) foreclosure of the debtor's equity of redemption; and (4) every mode of disposing of property or parting with an interest in property. \n(Sec. 3) Requires triennial adjustment of the $5,000 value of certain implements, professional books, tools of the trade, farm animals, and crops which a debtor may exempt from the property of the estate (protecting it from creditors' liens). \n(Sec. 6) Provides that a trustee or a creditors' and equity security holders' committee may pay a professional person they employ on a fixed or percentage fee basis, as well as on other bases already permitted. \n(Sec. 7) Allows a bankruptcy court to award reasonable compensation out of the debtor's estate to the debtor's attorney in chapter 7 (Liquidation) cases. \n(Sec. 10) Precludes an automatic stay of any transfer that is not avoidable in:  (1) cases where the trustee serves as lien creditor and successor to certain creditors and purchasers; and (2) postpetition transactions. \n(Sec. 11) Modifies guidelines governing assumption by the bankruptcy trustee of certain executory contracts and unexpired leases with specified defaults.  Permits a trustee to assume an unexpired lease of real property without first curing a default arising from any failure to perform nonmonetary obligations under the lease if it is impossible to cure the default by performing nonmonetary acts at and after the time of assumption.  Permits a trustee to assume an executory contract without first curing a default arising from such a failure: (1) if it is impossible to cure the default by performing nonmonetary acts at and after the time of assumption; and (2) if the court determines, based on the equities of the case, that the default should not be cured at and after such time. \nRepeals:  (1) the prohibition against trustee assumption or assignment of unexpired leases of aircraft facilities unless all such leases are assumed or assigned; and (2) the deemed rejection of such a lease if the trustee does not assume or reject it. \nRevises guidelines governing impairment of claims and interests in a Chapter 11 (Reorganization) case to:  (1) reflect the modifications made to executory contracts that are not required to be cured by the bankruptcy trustee; and (2) state that a claim or interest arising from any failure to perform a nonmonetary obligation is not impaired under a Reorganization plan if the plan compensates the claim or interest holder for actual pecuniary loss resulting from such failure. \n(Sec. 13) Excludes from compensable professional services any expenses incurred by an individual member of a creditors' and equity security holders' committee. \n(Sec. 15) Revises the prohibition against debtor avoidance of certain judicial liens in connection with a liability designated as, and actually in the nature of, alimony, maintenance, or support. \n(Sec. 16) Declares nondischargeable in bankruptcy a debt for death or personal injury caused by the debtor's operation of a watercraft or aircraft while intoxicated from alcohol, a drug, or other substance. Limits the nondischargeability of fees imposed by a court to fees so imposed on a prisoner. \n(Sec. 21) Revises guidelines governing preferences to provide that, if the trustee avoids a security interest given between 90 days and one year before the date of the filing of the petition, by the debtor to a non-insider for the benefit of a creditor that is an insider, then such security interest shall be considered to be avoided only with respect to the insider creditor. \n(Sec. 23) Revises setoff recovery rules to exclude from recovery by a trustee setoffs by swap participants. \n(Sec. 26) Requires the U.S. trustee in a chapter 11 (Reorganization) case to file a report certifying the election of an eligible, disinterested trustee at a meeting of creditors.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Agricultural Trade Facilitation \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Pursuant to article I, section 8, clause 3 of the \n        Constitution of the United States, Congress has the authority \n        to establish negotiating objectives for the United States for \n        agreements related to agricultural trade.\n            (2) From 2008 to 2010, the value of United States \n        agricultural exports averaged nearly $107 billion annually. \n        Compared to 1998 to 2000, when the total value of agricultural \n        exports averaged $51,000,000,000 annually, United States \n        agricultural exports have more than doubled in past ten years.\n            (3) The Department of Agriculture's Economic Research \n        Service reports that each $1,000,000,000 in United States \n        agricultural exports supports approximately 8,400 jobs. The \n        Economic Research Service further reports that United States \n        agricultural exports supported nearly 830,000 full-time \n        American jobs both on and off-farm in 2009.\n            (4) Even as the importance of agricultural exports to the \n        United States economy grows, there are continued reports that \n        non science-based sanitary and phytosanitary measures are \n        restricting trade, acting as non-tariff barriers to trade. The \n        elimination and reduction of unwarranted sanitary and \n        phytosanitary barriers to trade will increase United States \n        agricultural exports and jobs.\n            (5) Sanitary and phytosanitary measures are those designed \n        ``to protect human, animal or plant life or health from risks'' \n        arising from additives, contaminants, pests, toxins, diseases, \n        or disease-carrying and causing organisms in foods, beverages, \n        feedstuffs, animals, or plants. Sanitary and phytosanitary \n        measures can take such forms as specific product or processing \n        standards, requirements for products to be produced in disease-\n        free areas, quarantine regulations, certification or inspection \n        procedures, sampling and testing requirements, health-related \n        labeling measures, maximum permissible pesticide residue \n        levels, and prohibitions on certain food additives.\n            (6) There are currently 37 active disputes involving \n        sanitary and phytosanitary measures being argued within the \n        World Trade Organization (WTO) between Member countries. These \n        cases have been invoked under the WTO Agreement on the \n        Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures.\n            (7) While the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and \n        Phytosanitary Measures, to which all WTO Member countries are \n        parties, explicitly recognizes the rights of each country to \n        take their own measures, they must be science-based and applied \n        only to the extent necessary to protect human, animal or plant \n        health, and cannot be arbitrary or used to unjustifiably \n        discriminate domestically or between trading partners. Member \n        countries are also encouraged to observe established and \n        recognized international standards. Improper use of measures \n        can create substantial, if not complete, barriers to United \n        States exports when they are disguised barriers to trade, are \n        not supported by science, or are otherwise unwarranted.\n            (8) In 2010, a United States interagency group led by the \n        Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Service, \n        reviewed more than 1,000 notifications from 50 countries as \n        required under the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and \n        Phytosanitary Measures. The United States Government commented \n        on 173 proposed or in-force sanitary and phytosanitary \n        measures. Nearly one-half of the comments were measures \n        regarding processed products, one-third addressed requirements \n        for live animals and fish (and their products, including dairy \n        products); and almost one-quarter were for measures that \n        introduced new standards or entry requirements for plants, bulk \n        commodities (including those made with biotechnology), and \n        horticultural products.\n            (9) Each year, the United States Trade Representative \n        reports that non science-based sanitary and phytosanitary trade \n        barriers continue to threaten, constrain, or block United \n        States agricultural exports.\n            (10) A Department of Agriculture study of the impact of \n        foreign technical trade barriers on United States agricultural \n        exports reported the presence of ``questionable technical \n        barriers'' in more than 60 countries affecting trade in more \n        than 300 agricultural products, valued at an estimated $5 \n        billion of United States agricultural, forestry, and fishery \n        exports using 1996 data, accounting for about 7 percent of \n        total agricultural exports during that year. Although more \n        recent formal estimates of United States agricultural trade \n        effects are not available, the United States Trade \n        Representative continues to assert: ``[Sanitary and \n        phytosanitary] trade barriers prevent U.S. producers from \n        shipping hundreds of millions of dollars worth of goods, \n        hurting farms and small businesses''.\n            (11) The improper use of sanitary and phytosanitary trade \n        barriers to trade can be reduced through achieving and \n        implementing agreements that provide for enhanced \n        harmonization, transparency, equivalency, improved regulatory \n        practices, and more efficient and effective dispute settlement. \n        The elimination and reduction in use of such barriers to trade \n        will strengthen the international trading system by providing \n        certainty, predictability, and fair treatment.\n            (12) The Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and \n        Phytosanitary Measures has proven valuable to United States \n        exporters, but experience has exposed certain inadequacies in \n        its rules.\n            (13) Accordingly, as the United States prepares for future \n        trade agreements, the Administration must prioritize further \n        strengthening of rules on sanitary and phytosanitary measures.\n\nSEC. 3. TRADE NEGOTIATING OBJECTIVES OF THE UNITED STATES WITH RESPECT \n              TO THE APPLICATION OF SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY MEASURES \n              TO AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.\n\n    (a) Overall Trade Negotiating Objectives.--The overall trade \nnegotiating objective of the United States with respect to the \napplication of sanitary and phytosanitary measures to agricultural \nproducts for trade agreements between the United States and foreign \ncountries is to secure more open, equitable, and reciprocal market \naccess by strengthening the rules governing the application of sanitary \nand phytosanitary measures to agricultural products.\n    (b) Principal Trade Negotiating Objectives.--The principal trade \nnegotiating objectives of the United States with respect to the \napplication of sanitary and phytosanitary measures to agricultural \nproducts are the following:\n            (1) To strengthen the requirement that the application of \n        measures is based on scientific evidence by requiring parties \n        to the agreement to make available their risk assessments and \n        provide a science-based justification for regulations, in \n        particular in cases in which measures are more restrictive than \n        international standards.\n            (2) To encourage parties to the agreement to participate \n        actively in the development of international standards relating \n        to the application of measures and to apply those standards \n        whenever it is appropriate to do so and to require parties to \n        provide a scientific justification whenever they apply a \n        standard that deviates from an established international \n        standard.\n            (3) To improve regulatory coherence and increase the use of \n        systems-based approaches, to require parties to the agreement \n        to evaluate on a timely basis the health and safety protection \n        systems of other parties and to allow imports of products if \n        the system of the exporting party meets or exceeds the end-\n        product standards of the importing party.\n            (4) To require greater transparency in the development and \n        implementation of the measures, to require parties to the \n        agreement to publish proposed measures, including a scientific \n        justification, to provide an opportunity for interested parties \n        to comment on the proposal, and to take into account reasonable \n        concerns, and to require parties to provide significant advance \n        notice before implementing new, non-emergency measures in order \n        to provide ample time for any necessary adjustments by industry \n        in order to come into compliance.\n            (5) To require parties to the agreement to carry out risk \n        analysis in a timely manner consistent with the guidelines \n        developed by relevant international organizations, to ensure \n        that risk assessments are based on the most relevant scientific \n        data, to require parties to consider the full range of risk \n        management options and to ensure that the measures are no more \n        trade-restrictive than necessary to meet the intended purpose, \n        and to require effective risk communication.\n            (6) To improve rules governing the testing of imported \n        products, to require importing parties to use validated test \n        methods and to provide importers with the right to a \n        confirmatory test, and to provide the right of appeal.\n            (7) To promote the harmonization of export certification \n        requirements and to require that parties to the agreement limit \n        information requirements on export documents to that which is \n        necessary to determine whether a product meets sanitary and \n        phytosanitary standards.\n            (8) To ensure that new sanitary and phytosanitary trade \n        obligations are fully enforceable through an a more efficient \n        and effective dispute settlement process.\n\nSEC. 4.

RESPONSE TO SEVERE INFESTATIONS OF BARK BEETLES AND OTHER \n              INSECTS ON FEDERAL LAND IN COLORADO.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Fire and bark beetles and other insects that feed on \n        trees are natural parts of Colorado's forest ecology that have \n        some beneficial effects and help shape the forests by thinning \n        dense tree stands and promoting cyclical re-growth.\n            (2) However, in various parts of Colorado, large-scale \n        infestations of bark beetles and other insects, in combination \n        with other factors, have increased the likelihood of unusually \n        severe wildfires that pose a threat to lives and property in \n        nearby communities and to municipal water supplies and other \n        infrastructure.\n            (3) The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 (Public Law \n        108-148; 16 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.) was enacted to address the \n        need to reduce the volume of fuel that can feed the most severe \n        wildfires that threaten communities.\n            (4) The modification of some provisions of the Healthy \n        Forests Restoration Act of 2003 will help to further expedite \n        action to reduce the risks of severe wildfires to Colorado \n        communities, water supplies, and infrastructure in or near \n        forested areas most severely affected by infestations of bark \n        beetles and other insects.\n    (b) Insect-Emergency Area Defined.--Section 101 of the Healthy \nForests Restoration Act of 2003 (16 U.S.C. 6511) is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating paragraphs (12) through (16) as \n        paragraphs (13) through (17), respectively; and\n            (2) by inserting after paragraph (11) the following new \n        paragraph:\n            ``(12) Insect-emergency area.--The term `insect-emergency \n        area' means an area of Federal land in Colorado designated by \n        the Secretary pursuant to section 107.''.\n    (c) Alternative Analysis Process.--Section 104(d)(2) of the Healthy \nForests Restoration Act of 2003 (16 U.S.C. 6514(d)(2)) is amended by \ninserting after ``at-risk community'' the following: ``or on any other \nlands identified for such a project in a community wildfire protection \nplan for an at-risk community in or adjacent to an insect-emergency \narea''.\n    (d) Response to Insect Emergencies.--Title I of the Healthy Forests \nRestoration Act of 2003 is amended--\n            (1) by redesignating sections 107 and 108 as sections 108 \n        and 109, respectively; and\n            (2) by inserting after section 106 (16 U.S.C. 6516) the \n        following new section:\n\n``SEC. 107.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING VOTES BY ELECTORS AFTER DEATH OR \n              INCAPACITY OF NOMINEES.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) during a Presidential election year, the nominees of \n        each political party for the office of President and Vice \n        President should jointly announce and designate on or before \n        the final day of the convention (or related event) at which \n        they are nominated the individuals for whom the electors of \n        President and Vice President who are pledged to vote for such \n        nominees should give their votes for such offices in the event \n        that such nominees are deceased or permanently incapacitated \n        prior to the date of the meeting of the electors of each State \n        under section 7 of title 3, United States Code;\n            (2) in the event a nominee for President is deceased or \n        permanently incapacitated prior to the date referred to in \n        paragraph (1) (but the nominee for Vice President of the same \n        political party is not deceased or permanently incapacitated), \n        the electors of President who are pledged to vote for the \n        nominee should give their votes to the nominee of the same \n        political party for the office of Vice President, and the \n        electors of Vice President who are pledged to vote for the \n        nominee for Vice President should give their votes to the \n        individual designated for such office by the nominees under \n        paragraph (1);\n            (3) in the event a nominee for Vice President is deceased \n        or permanently incapacitated prior to the date referred to in \n        paragraph (1) (but the nominee for President of the same \n        political party is not deceased or permanently incapacitated), \n        the electors of Vice President who are pledged to vote for such \n        nominee should give their votes to the individual designated \n        for such office by the nominees under paragraph (1);\n            (4) in the event that both the nominee for President and \n        the nominee for Vice President of the same political party are \n        deceased or permanently incapacitated prior to the date \n        referred to in paragraph (1), the electors of President and \n        Vice President who are pledged to vote for such nominees should \n        vote for the individuals designated for each such office by the \n        nominees under paragraph (1); and\n            (5) political parties should establish rules and procedures \n        consistent with the procedures described in the preceding \n        paragraphs, including procedures to obtain written pledges from \n        electors to vote in the manner described in such paragraphs.\n\nSEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE CONTINUITY OF GOVERNMENT AND THE \n              SMOOTH TRANSITION OF EXECUTIVE POWER.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) members of the Senate, regardless of political party \n        affiliation, agree that the American people deserve a \n        Government that is failsafe and foolproof, and that terrorists \n        should never have the ability to disrupt the operations of the \n        Government;\n            (2) continuity of governmental operations in the wake of a \n        catastrophic terrorist attack remains a pressing issue of \n        national importance before the United States Congress;\n            (3) at a minimum, terrorists should never have the ability, \n        by launching a terrorist attack, to change the political party \n        that is in control of the Government, regardless of which party \n        is in power;\n            (4) whenever control of the White House shall change from \n        one political party to another, the outgoing President and the \n        incoming President should work together, and with the Senate to \n        the extent determined appropriate by the Senate, to ensure a \n        smooth transition of executive power, in the interest of the \n        American people;\n            (5) under the current presidential succession statute in \n        section 19 of title 3, United States Code, the members of the \n        cabinet, defined as the heads of the statutory executive \n        departments under section 101 of title 5, United States Code, \n        fall within the line of succession to the presidency;\n            (6) during previous presidential transition periods, the \n        incoming President has had to serve with cabinet members from \n        the prior administration, including subcabinet officials from \n        the prior administration acting as cabinet members, for at \n        least some period of time;\n            (7) the Constitution vests the appointment power of \n        executive branch officials in the President, by and with the \n        advice and consent of the Senate, and nothing in this \n        resolution is intended to alter either the constitutional power \n        of the President or the constitutional function of the Senate \n        with regard to the confirmation of presidential nominees;\n            (8) an incoming President cannot exercise the \n        constitutional powers of the President, in order to ensure a \n        smooth transition of Government, until noon on the 20th day of \n        January, pursuant to the terms of the twentieth amendment to \n        the Constitution;\n            (9) cooperation between the incoming and the outgoing \n        President is therefore the only way to ensure a smooth \n        transition of Government;\n            (10) Congress throughout history has acted consistently and \n        in a bipartisan fashion to encourage measures to ensure the \n        smooth transition of executive power from one President to \n        another, such as through the enactment of the Presidential \n        Transition Act of 1963 (3 U.S.C. 102 note; Public Law 88-277) \n        and subsequent amendments;\n            (11) Congress has previously concluded that ``[t]he \n        national interest requires'' that ``the orderly transfer of the \n        executive power in connection with the expiration of the term \n        of office of a President and the inauguration of a new \n        President . . . be accomplished so as to assure continuity in \n        the faithful execution of the laws and in the conduct of the \n        affairs of the Federal Government, both domestic and foreign'' \n        under the Presidential Transition Act of 1963 (3 U.S.C. 102 \n        note; Public Law 88-277);\n            (12) Congress has further concluded that ``[a]ny disruption \n        occasioned by the transfer of the executive power could produce \n        results detrimental to the safety and well-being of the United \n        States and its people'' under the Presidential Transition Act \n        of 1963 (3 U.S.C. 102 note; Public Law 88-277);\n            (13) Congress has previously expressed its intent ``that \n        appropriate actions be authorized and taken to avoid or \n        minimize any disruption'' and ``that all officers of the \n        Government so conduct the affairs of the Government for which \n        they exercise responsibility and authority as (1) to be mindful \n        of problems occasioned by transitions in the office of the \n        President, (2) to take appropriate lawful steps to avoid or \n        minimize disruptions that might be occasioned by the transfer \n        of the executive power, and (3) otherwise to promote orderly \n        transitions in the office of President'' under the Presidential \n        Transition Act of 1963 (3 U.S.C. 102 note; Public Law 88-277);\n            (14) the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the \n        United States established under title VI of the Intelligence \n        Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 (6 U.S.C. 101 note; \n        Public Law 107-306) expressly recognized the need to ``Improve \n        the Transitions between Administrations'' in its final report;\n            (15) the Commission specifically recommended that, \n        ``[s]ince a catastrophic attack could occur with little or no \n        notice, we should minimize as much as possible the disruption \n        of national security policymaking during the change of \n        administrations by accelerating the process for national \n        security appointments'' and that ``the process could be \n        improved significantly so transitions can work more effectively \n        and allow new officials to assume their new responsibilities as \n        quickly as possible'';\n            (16) the Commission suggested that ``[a] president-elect \n        should submit lists of possible candidates for national \n        security positions to begin obtaining security clearances \n        immediately after the election, so that their background \n        investigations can be complete before January 20'', that ``[a] \n        president-elect should submit the nominations of the entire new \n        national security team, through the level of under secretary of \n        cabinet departments, not later than January 20'', that ``[t]he \n        Senate, in return, should adopt special rules requiring \n        hearings and votes to confirm or reject national security \n        nominees within 30 days of their submission'', and that an \n        outgoing Administration should work cooperatively with an \n        incoming President to ensure a smooth transition, in the \n        interest of national security; and\n            (17) there is no more important national security position \n        than the office of President, and thus it is essential to \n        national security that any new administration establish its own \n        clear and stable line of succession to the presidency as \n        quickly as possible.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that during the \nperiod preceding the end of a term of office in which a President will \nnot be serving a succeeding term--\n            (1) that President should consider submitting the \n        nominations of individuals to the Senate who are selected by \n        the President-elect for offices that fall within the line of \n        succession;\n            (2) the Senate should consider conducting confirmation \n        proceedings and votes on the nominations described under \n        paragraph (1), to the extent determined appropriate by the \n        Senate, between January 3 and January 20 before the \n        Inauguration; and\n            (3) that President should consider agreeing to sign and \n        deliver commissions for all approved nominations on January 20 \n        before the Inauguration to ensure continuity of Government.", "output": "Presidential Succession Act of 2010 - Revises provisions governing presidential succession to: (1) provide that the person next in line to succeed the President after the Vice President (currently, the Speaker of the House of Representatives) shall be the individual whose name is submitted by the President to the Clerk of the House from among the Speaker of the House, the Majority Leader of the House, or the Minority Leader of the House (or the Speaker until the President submits such name); (2) provide that the person next in line (currently the President Pro Tempore of the Senate) after such designated House leader shall be the individual whose name is submitted by the President to the Secretary of the Senate from among the Majority Leader of the Senate, the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, or the Minority Leader of the Senate (or the Majority Leader of the Senate until the President submits such name); (3) include in the succession list, after the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Ambassadors to the United Nations, Great Britain, Russia, China, and France, in that order; and (4) provide that the taking of the oath of office by an individual specified in the succession list shall not require resignation from the office qualifying such individual for succession.\n\nPermits the succession list to include only such officers that are: (1) eligible to the office of President under the Constitution; (2) not under impeachment by the House of Representatives; and (3) except for the designated House or Senate leader, appointed to the office involved, by and with the Senate's advice and consent, prior to succession.\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress regarding: (1) to whom electors should give their votes in the event of the death or incapacity of nominees for President and Vice President; and (2) nomination by a President who will not be serving a succeeding term of individuals selected by the President-elect for offices that fall within the line of succession, confirmation of such nominees by the Senate, and the signing and delivery of commissions to all such approved nominations, before the inauguration of the President-elect, to ensure continuity of government.", "category": "Summarization 751.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given text for US Congressional and California state bills, your task is to generate a summary for this bill.", "input": "SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Post-Abortion Depression Research \nand Care Act of 2007''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) About 3,000,000 women per year in the United States \n        have an unplanned or unwanted pregnancy, and approximately \n        1,186,000 of these pregnancies end in elective abortion.\n            (2) Abortion can have severe and long-term effects on the \n        mental and emotional well-being of women. Women often \n        experience sadness and guilt following abortions with no one to \n        console them. They may have difficulty in bonding with new \n        babies, become overprotective parents or develop problems in \n        their relationship with their spouses. Problems such as eating \n        disorders, depression, and suicide attempts have also been \n        traced to past abortions.\n            (3) The symptoms of post-abortion depression include bouts \n        of crying, guilt, intense grief or sadness, emotional numbness, \n        eating disorders, drug and alcohol abuse, suicidal urges, \n        anxiety and panic attacks, anger or rage, sexual problems or \n        promiscuity, lowered self esteem, nightmares and sleep \n        disturbance, flashbacks, and difficulty with relationships.\n            (4) Women who aborted a first pregnancy are four times more \n        likely to report substance abuse compared to those who suffered \n        a natural loss of their first pregnancy, and they are five \n        times more likely to report subsequent substance abuse than \n        women who carried to term.\n            (5) Greater thought suppression is associated with \n        experiencing more intrusive thoughts of the abortion. Both \n        suppression and intrusive thoughts, in turn, are positively \n        related to increases in psychological distress over time.\n            (6) Women who experience decision-making difficulties and \n        may lack social support may experience more negative emotional \n        consequences to induced abortion.\n            (7) Post-abortion depression often relates to the lack of \n        understanding in society and the medical community of the \n        complexity of post-abortion depression, and economic pressures \n        placed on hospitals and providers are contributing factors.\n            (8) Social pressure to have an abortion can be directly \n        related to higher levels of immediate regret and more mental \n        undoing over subsequent years.\n            (9) Post-abortion depression is a treatable disorder if \n        promptly diagnosed by a trained provider and attended to with a \n        personalized regimen of care including social support, therapy, \n        medication, and when necessary hospitalization.\n            (10) While there have been many studies regarding the \n        emotional aftermath of abortion, very little research has been \n        sponsored by the National Institutes of Health.\n            (11) A major New Zealand study shows abortion has serious \n        negative consequences for women. Among the alarming findings \n        with respect to girls 15 through 18 years of age are the \n        following:\n                    (A) With respect to experiencing major depression--\n                            (i) those who had not become pregnant had a \n                        31.2 percent chance;\n                            (ii) those who became pregnant but did not \n                        have an abortion had a 35.7 percent chance; and\n                            (iii) those who had an abortion had an \n                        astonishing 78.6 percent chance.\n                    (B) With respect to experiencing anxiety--\n                            (i) those who had not become pregnant had a \n                        37.9 percent chance;\n                            (ii) those who became pregnant but did not \n                        have an abortion had a 35.7 percent chance; and\n                            (iii) those who had an abortion had a 64.3 \n                        percent chance.\n                    (C) With respect to thoughts of suicide--\n                            (i) those who had not become pregnant had a \n                        23 percent chance;\n                            (ii) those who became pregnant but did not \n                        have an abortion had a 25 percent chance; and\n                            (iii) those who had an abortion had a 50 \n                        percent chance.\n\n      TITLE I--RESEARCH ON POST-ABORTION DEPRESSION AND PSYCHOSIS\n\nSEC. 101.

The summary of that version is repeated here. Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2016 (Sec. 2) This bill amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act) to revise and reauthorize the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Great Lakes Restoration Initiative for FY2017-FY2021.  The bill restates the initiative's priorities for Great Lakes protection and restoration programs and projects, including: (1) the remediation of toxic substances and areas of concern; (2) the prevention and control of invasive species and their impacts; (3) the protection and restoration of near-shore health and the prevention and mitigation of nonpoint source pollution (water pollution that comes from many diffuse sources, such as pollution on the ground picked up by rain or snow); (4) habitat and wildlife protection and restoration; and (5) accountability, monitoring, evaluation, communication, and partnership activities. In selecting the best combination of the initiative's programs and projects, the EPA must consult with the Great Lake states and Indian Tribes and solicit input from other non-federal stakeholders. The EPA must designate a point person from an appropriate federal partner to coordinate, with federal partners and non-federal stakeholders, the initiative's projects and activities involving harmful algal blooms in the Great Lakes. In addition to current requirements concerning the use of funds made available to carry out the initiative, the bill requires initiative funds to be used to strategically implement operations and activities of EPA's Great Lakes National Program Office, such as remediation of sediment contamination in areas of concern. The EPA or federal department or agency that receives funds under the initiative may make a grant to, or enter into an agreement with, a qualified nonfederal entity for planning, researching, monitoring, outreach, or implementation of a project that supports the Initiative Action Plan or the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. Projects may be carried out under the initiative on multiple levels, including at the local level. Funding made available to implement the initiative may not be used for any water infrastructure activity (other than a green infrastructure project that improves habitat and other ecosystem functions in the Great Lakes) for which funding is made available under the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2014.  The EPA must review, and revise, if appropriate, the Initiative Action Plan at least once every five years. The EPA must also: (1) establish a process for monitoring and periodically reporting to the public on the plan's progress, (2) make information about each project carried out under the plan available on a public website, and (3) provide to specified congressional committees a yearly detailed description of the initiative's progress and amounts transferred to participating federal departments and agencies for carrying out activities that support the initiative.", "category": "Summarization 751.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given text for US Congressional and California state bills, your task is to generate a summary for this bill.", "input": "SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Community STEM Learning Act of \n2015''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Employment projections forecast a 17-percent growth in \n        the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics \n        (``STEM)'' fields over the next decade.\n            (2) Ninety-two percent of STEM occupations will require at \n        least some post-secondary education.\n            (3) While the number of degrees awarded in STEM fields has \n        increased steadily since the 1960s, the overall share of STEM \n        degrees awarded has actually shrunk in comparison to all \n        degrees conferred.\n            (4) Internationally, a larger proportion of all degrees \n        awarded are in the STEM fields. While 16 percent of degrees \n        awarded in the United States are in STEM fields, nearly 50 \n        percent of degrees awarded in China, 38 percent in South Korea, \n        and 28 percent in Germany are in STEM fields.\n            (5) Minorities are seriously underrepresented in the \n        science and engineering workforce in the United States, with \n        just under 6 percent of Blacks and over 5 percent of Hispanics \n        participating in the STEM workforce.\n            (6) Twenty-one percent of Black college students enter \n        college with STEM majors, but only 16 percent actually receive \n        a bachelor's degree in a STEM major.\n            (7) Over \\1/2\\ of Black students that enroll in a 4-year \n        university are interested in STEM, but are not proficient in \n        math.\n            (8) Since 1990, mathematic scores on the assessments \n        conducted by the National Assessment of Education Progress have \n        increased for all students, but White students have average \n        scores 27 points higher than Black and Hispanic students.\n            (9) After school programs play an important role in \n        addressing the achievement gap in underserved communities. \n        Studies demonstrate that STEM learning during the school day is \n        necessary but not sufficient for life-long STEM literacy.\n            (10) As many as 8,400,000 students are enrolled in after \n        school programs. Ethnic minority children are more likely than \n        non-minority children to participate in after school programs. \n        While 15 percent of all students are enrolled in after school \n        programs, 24 percent of Black students and 21 percent of \n        Hispanic students are enrolled in such programs.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to prepare middle school \nand secondary school students to be ready for opportunities in the STEM \nfields in college and in careers through strong after school, summer, \nand weekend programs that focus on STEM education.\n\nSEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The steady decline in the defense budget during the \n        past 15 years has eroded the readiness of the Armed Forces to \n        execute those missions called for under the National Military \n        Strategy to the point where the Joint Chiefs of Staff have \n        repeatedly characterized the ability of the Armed Forces to \n        execute the National Military Strategy as representing \n        ``moderate to high risk''.\n            (2) This erosion in readiness of the Armed Forces, \n        particularly in recent years, has resulted from inadequate \n        rates of equipment modernization, delayed equipment \n        maintenance, degraded quality and quantity of combat training, \n        and a declining quality of life for members of the Armed Forces \n        and their families.\n            (3) The declining quality of life for members of the Armed \n        Forces and their families has resulted from a range of factors, \n        including inadequacies in pay and benefits, military \n        retirement, health care, military housing, and family support \n        programs, as shown by the following:\n                    (A) Low military pay, estimated on average to be \n                13.5 percent behind civilian levels, is forcing \n                servicemembers and their families to struggle to make \n                ends meet.\n                    (B) Inequities in the current military retirement \n                system are a contributing factor to the current \n                military personnel retention problem.\n                    (C) Growing dissatisfaction with military health \n                care is another important factor contributing to \n                military retention problems.\n                    (D) Military families and unaccompanied military \n                personnel continue to live in inadequate facilities, as \n                indicated by the fact that military barracks and \n                dormitories are on average over 45 years old and almost \n                two-thirds of military family housing has been deemed \n                by the Department of Defense as unsuitable.\n                    (E) With a current force in which 65 percent of \n                military personnel are married, family support programs \n                are increasingly inadequate to meet their needs in the \n                face of historically high rates of peacetime operations \n                and the resulting increase in family separations.\n            (4) The drawdown of the Armed Forces during the post-Cold \n        War period, combined with the dramatic increase in the pace of \n        military operations during the same period, has resulted in \n        significant strains on military personnel and their families.\n            (5) The Armed Forces face severe recruiting and retention \n        difficulties and shortages of personnel with high-demand \n        skills.\n            (6) Surveys conducted by the Armed Forces and testimony \n        before Congress indicate that the leading factors in declining \n        retention rates are inadequate pay, family separations \n        resulting from increased contingency operations, and the lack \n        of adequate resources to carry out assigned missions.\n\nSEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that--\n            (1) the United States must provide the Armed Forces with \n        sufficient resources to maintain the necessary capability to \n        execute the National Military Strategy with minimal risk; and\n            (2) despite past congressional efforts to improve military \n        pay and benefits and housing, health care, and family support \n        programs, a comprehensive effort is required to revitalize and \n        sustain the all-volunteer force and address the decline in the \n        quality of life for members of Armed Forces and their families \n        by--\n                    (A) significantly improving the quality and \n                availability of affordable housing for military \n                families and enhancing the condition of housing for \n                unaccompanied military personnel;\n                    (B) reforming the military retirement system to \n                permit the Armed Forces to retain sufficient high-\n                quality personnel to meet requirements; and\n                    (C) enhancing pay and benefits to permit the Armed \n                Forces to recruit and retain high-quality personnel.\n\nSEC. 4.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``National Aviation Capacity Expansion \nAct''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The reliability and efficiency of the national air \n        transportation system significantly depend on the efficiency of \n        Chicago O'Hare International Airport. Because of O'Hare's \n        central location, and the magnitude of the demand for air \n        transportation services in northeast Illinois and northwest \n        Indiana, O'Hare has an essential role in the national air \n        transportation system. The reliability and efficiency of \n        interstate air transportation for residents and businesses in \n        many States depend on efficient processing of air traffic \n        operations at O'Hare.\n            (2) The largest efficient hub airports in the United States \n        are designed with multiple parallel runways without substantial \n        runway intersections. O'Hare cannot efficiently perform its \n        role in the national air transportation system unless it has \n        such a design.\n            (3) New runway construction projects are local decisions \n        that are supported by the Federal Government through the \n        Airport Improvement Program and other programs. Given the \n        importance of air travel to our national economy, and the \n        importance of O'Hare to national air transportation, it is \n        critical that the Federal Government does all it can to \n        facilitate redesign of O'Hare and the development of a \n        supplemental air carrier airport located near Peotone, \n        Illinois.\n            (4) The Governor of Illinois and the Mayor of Chicago have \n        determined that redesign of O'Hare and the development of a \n        supplemental air carrier airport located near Peotone, \n        Illinois, as described in this Act, are each necessary and \n        desirable to provide reliable and efficient air commerce.\n            (5) On December 5, 2001, the Governor of Illinois and the \n        Mayor of Chicago signed an historic agreement that would \n        modernize O'Hare International Airport, by providing for--\n                    (A) east-west parallel runways;\n                    (B) construction of a south suburban airport near \n                Peotone;\n                    (C) addressing traffic congestion along the \n                Northwest Corridor, including western airport access;\n                    (D) continuation of the operation of Chicago Meigs \n                Field; and\n                    (E) maintenance of the quality of life for \n                residents near the airports.\n            (6) The importance of increasing commercial air service at \n        the Gary-Chicago and Greater Rockford Airports is also \n        recognized.\n\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Piracy Deterrence and Education Act \nof 2003''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The Internet, while changing the way our society \n        communicates, has also changed the nature of many crimes, \n        including the theft of intellectual property.\n            (2) Trafficking in copyrighted works through increasingly \n        sophisticated electronic means, including peer-to-peer file \n        trading networks, Internet chat rooms, and newsgroups, \n        threatens lost jobs, lost income for creators, lower tax \n        revenue, and higher prices for honest purchasers.\n            (3) The most popular peer-to-peer file trading software \n        programs have been downloaded by computer users over \n        200,000,000 times. At any one time there are over 3,000,000 \n        users simultaneously using just one of these services. Each \n        month, on average, over 2,300,000,000 digital-media files are \n        transferred among users of peer-to-peer systems.\n            (4) Many computer users either do not know that copyright \n        laws apply to Internet activity or simply believe that they \n        will not be caught or prosecuted for their conduct.\n            (5) In addition, many of the computer users drawn to the \n        convenience of peer-to-peer systems do not realize that these \n        systems pose serious security and privacy threats to their \n        personal computers or company networks. Recent studies reveal \n        that the majority of the users of these systems are unable to \n        tell what files they are sharing and sometimes incorrectly \n        assume they were not sharing any files when in fact they were \n        sharing all files on their hard drive.\n            (6) The security and privacy threats posed by peer-to-peer \n        networks extend beyond users inadvertently enabling a hacker to \n        access files. Millions of copies of one of the most popular \n        peer-to-peer networks contain software that could allow an \n        independent company to take over portions of users' computers \n        and Internet connections and has the capacity to keep track of \n        users' online habits.\n            (7) In light of these considerations, it is important that \n        Federal law enforcement agencies actively pursue criminals who \n        steal the copyrighted works of others, and prevent such \n        activity through enforcement and awareness. It is also \n        important that the public be educated about the security and \n        privacy risks associated with being connected to an \n        unauthorized peer-to-peer network.\n            (8) In addition, the Bureau of Customs and Border \n        Protection of the Department of Homeland Security has the \n        authority to act against infringements of copyrighted works, \n        including those works protected under the Berne Convention and \n        the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property \n        of the World Trade Organization. Under United States law, \n        merchandise can be seized by or forfeited to the Bureau of \n        Customs and Border Protection if ``it is merchandise or \n        packaging in which copyright, trademark, or trade name \n        protection violations are involved'' (section 596(c)(2)(C) of \n        the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1595a(c)(2)(C)).\n            (9) Though the regulations of the Bureau of Customs and \n        Border Protection (section 133.31 of title 19, Code of Federal \n        Regulations) provide that registered copyrighted works may be \n        recorded with the Bureau for ``import protection,'' recordation \n        is not explicitly required before infringing merchandise can be \n        seized or forfeited. Notwithstanding present legal authority, \n        there have been concerns raised about the authority of the \n        Bureau of Customs and Border Protection to seize infringing \n        copyrighted materials that have neither been registered with \n        the United States Copyright Office or recorded with the Bureau.\n            (10) Neither United States nor foreign works require \n        registration with the Copyright Office for protection of the \n        copyright in those works. United States works require \n        registration only before an action for infringement is brought \n        under title 17, United States Code. A foreign work need not be \n        registered to bring such an action for infringement, and none \n        of the rights contained in title 17, United States Code, \n        including the right to control distribution in section 106 of \n        that title or importation under section 602 of that title, are \n        contingent upon registration. In accordance with the \n        international obligations of the United States barring the use \n        of formalities, United States law gives foreign copyright \n        owners direct access to United States courts and procedures \n        without resort to any registration requirement, and section 603 \n        of title 17, United States Code, directs the Secretary of the \n        Treasury and the United States Postal Service to separately or \n        jointly make regulations for the enforcement of the provisions \n        of title 17, United States Code, prohibiting importation.\n            (11) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this \n        section, the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection has been \n        unclear about its legal authority to seize infringing \n        copyrighted materials that have neither been registered with \n        the Copyright Office nor recorded with the Bureau. To provide \n        clarity, it is necessary to specify the authority of the Bureau \n        of Customs and Border Protection to seize infringing materials \n        protected by the copyright laws, with or without registration \n        or recordation.\n\nSEC. 3. DETERRENCE AND COORDINATION.\n\n    The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall--\n            (1) develop a program to deter members of the public from \n        committing acts of copyright infringement by--\n                    (A) offering on the Internet copies of copyrighted \n                works, or\n                    (B) making copies of copyrighted works from the \n                Internet,\n        without the authorization of the copyright owners; and\n            (2) facilitate the sharing among law enforcement agencies, \n        Internet service providers, and copyright owners of information \n        concerning activities described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of \n        paragraph (1).\nThe program under paragraph (1) shall include issuing appropriate \nwarnings to individuals engaged in an activity described in \nsubparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) that they may be subject to \ncriminal prosecution.\n\nSEC. 4.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Citizen Legislature and Political \nFreedom Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds as follows:\n            (1) The proliferation of campaign finance laws (beginning \n        with the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971) and the \n        proliferation of government regulations promulgated pursuant to \n        such laws have placed strict limits on contributions by \n        citizens to the candidates of their choice, limits which have \n        served to severely hinder the ability of challengers to compete \n        on equal terms with incumbent politicians.\n            (2) The contribution limits imposed by the Federal Election \n        Campaign Act of 1971 force candidates to raise funds in small \n        amounts subject to fixed limitations, inevitably fostering a \n        system under which wealthy candidates and long-term incumbent \n        politicians hold an unfair financial advantage, which in turn \n        serves to discourage potential candidates from seeking public \n        office.\n            (3) The current campaign finance laws have inhibited the \n        full and fair discussion of public policy issues, as \n        challengers who are not well known to the electorate are forced \n        by government regulation to attempt to amass contributions from \n        large numbers of donors at the outset of a campaign. As a \n        result, challengers who lack the necessary resources to bring \n        new issues into the public debate often are eliminated from \n        political campaigns before their voices are even heard.\n            (4) The regulation by government of political speech \n        through the regulation of campaign contributions and \n        expenditures is patently undemocratic because it favors \n        institutionalized special interests over grassroots and citizen \n        activity by imposing burdensome reporting and disclosure \n        requirements and stringent spending limits on the political \n        parties, thereby tilting the financial and tactical advantage \n        in political campaigns to well-financed interest groups and \n        wealthy individuals.\n            (5) The effect of the unreasonably low contribution limits \n        has been to force more contributors and political activists to \n        operate outside the system, resulting in even less \n        accountability and even greater encouragement of irresponsible \n        behavior.\n            (6) The only way to encourage the robust discourse of \n        public issues and candidates, promote the free exchange of \n        political speech and ideas, protect constitutional freedom, and \n        foster a more informed electorate is to lift all current \n        restrictions on political candidate and party contributions and \n        expenditures and to provide full, instantaneous disclosure of \n        all contributions and expenditures in elections for Federal \n        office.\n\nSEC. 3. REMOVAL OF LIMITATIONS ON FEDERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN \n              CONTRIBUTIONS.\n\n    Section 315(a) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 \nU.S.C. 441a(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following new \nparagraph:\n    ``(9) The limitations established under this subsection shall not \napply to contributions made during calendar years beginning after \n2004.''.\n\nSEC. 4.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Metropolitan Medical Response System \nAct of 2010''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In its January 2010 report card, the Commission on the \n        Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and \n        Terrorism stated that the Federal Government must ``become a \n        stronger advocate for citizen, community, state, and regional \n        preparedness to effectively respond'' to both natural disasters \n        and man-made events.\n            (2) The Metropolitan Medical Response System (MMRS) is the \n        only program at the Federal level that supports the integration \n        of local emergency management, law enforcement, and health and \n        medical systems into a coordinated response to a mass casualty \n        event caused by a weapon of mass destruction, an incident \n        involving hazardous materials, an epidemic disease outbreak, or \n        a natural disaster.\n            (3) The MMRS program was established in the wake of the \n        1995 deadly release of sarin nerve gas in a Tokyo subway, and \n        the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah building in Oklahoma \n        City.\n            (4) The MMRS program aims to improve medical response \n        systems, by enhancing the existing local response systems and \n        capabilities of a community before an incident occurs.\n            (5) The MMRS program provides tangible benefits in the form \n        of increased operational capacity and communication, improved \n        personnel training, stockpiled pharmaceuticals, and adequate \n        supplies of personal protective equipment and other specialized \n        response equipment.\n            (6) The MMRS program supports a number of other existing \n        Federal programs, such as the Hospital Preparedness Program, \n        the Cities Readiness Initiative, the State Homeland Security \n        Program, and Urban Area Security Initiative.\n            (7) The MMRS program provides funding to 124 local \n        jurisdictions in 43 States, covering approximately 70 percent \n        of the United States population.\n            (8) The MMRS program has become an increasingly vital part \n        of our homeland security infrastructure in the wake of recent \n        influenza outbreaks, renewed terrorists threats, and severe \n        weather emergencies.\n\nSEC. 3.

A motion further to limit debate is in order and \n        not debatable. An amendment to, or a motion to postpone, or a \n        motion to proceed to the consideration of other business, or a \n        motion to recommit the implementation bill is not in order. A \n        motion to reconsider the vote by which the implementation bill \n        is agreed to or disagreed to is not in order.\n            (4) Vote on final passage.--Immediately following the \n        conclusion of the debate on an implementation bill, and a \n        single quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if requested \n        in accordance with the rules of the appropriate House, the vote \n        on final passage of the implementation bill shall occur.\n            (5) Rulings of the chair on procedure.--Appeals from the \n        decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the rules \n        of the Senate or the House of Representatives, as the case may \n        be, to the procedure relating to an implementation bill shall \n        be decided without debate.\n    (d) Coordination With Action by Other House.--If, before the \npassage by 1 House of an implementation bill of that House, that House \nreceives from the other House an implementation bill, then the \nfollowing procedures shall apply:\n            (1) Nonreferral.--The implementation bill of the other \n        House shall not be referred to a committee.\n            (2) Vote on bill of other house.--With respect to an \n        implementation bill of the House receiving the implementation \n        bill--\n                    (A) the procedure in that House shall be the same \n                as if no implementation bill had been received from the \n                other House; but\n                    (B) the vote on final passage shall be on the \n                implementation bill of the other House.\n    (e) Rules of the Senate and the House of Representatives.--This \nsection is enacted by Congress--\n            (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n        and House of Representatives, respectively, and as such it is \n        deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but \n        applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in \n        that House in the case of an implementation bill described in \n        subsection (a), and it supersedes other rules only to the \n        extent that it is inconsistent with such rules; and\n            (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n        either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the \n        procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and \n        to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that \n        House.\n\nSEC. 8.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Safe Havens for Children Act of \n1997''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Family violence does not necessarily cease when family \n        victims are legally separated by divorce or otherwise not \n        sharing a household.\n            (2) According to a 1996 report by the American \n        Psychological Association, custody and visitation disputes are \n        more frequent when there is a history of domestic violence.\n            (3) Family violence often escalates following separation \n        and divorce, and child custody and visitation arrangements \n        become the new forum for the continuation of abuse.\n            (4) According to a 1996 report by the American \n        Psychological Association, fathers who batter mothers are twice \n        as likely to seek sole custody of their children. In these \n        circumstances, if the abusive father loses custody he is more \n        likely to continue the threats to the mother through other \n        legal actions.\n            (5) Some perpetrators of violence use the children as pawns \n        to control the abused party and to commit more violence during \n        separation or divorce. In one study, 34 percent of women in \n        shelters and callers to hotlines reported threats of \n        kidnapping, 11 percent reported that the batterer had kidnapped \n        the child for some period, and 21 percent reported that threats \n        of kidnapping forced the victim to return to the batterer.\n            (6) Approximately 90 percent of children in homes in which \n        their mothers are abused witness the abuse. Children who \n        witness domestic violence may exhibit more aggressive, \n        antisocial, fearful, and inhibited behaviors. Such children \n        display more anxiety, aggression and temperamental problems.\n            (7) Women and children are at an elevated risk of violence \n        during the process of separation or divorce.\n            (8) Fifty to 70 percent of men who abuse their spouses or \n        partners also physically abuse their children.\n            (9) Up to 75 percent of all domestic assaults reported to \n        law enforcement agencies were inflicted after the separation of \n        the couple.\n            (10) In one study of spousal homicide, over \\1/2\\ of the \n        male defendants were separated from their victims.\n            (11) Seventy-three percent of battered women seeking \n        emergency medical services do so after separation.\n            (12) The National Council of Juvenile and Family Court \n        Judges includes the option of visitation centers in their Model \n        Code on Domestic and Family Violence.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of section 2 are--\n            (1) to protect children from the trauma of witnessing or \n        experiencing violence, sexual abuse, neglect, abduction, rape, \n        or death during parent and child visitation and visitation \n        exchanges;\n            (2) to protect victims of domestic violence from \n        experiencing further violence, abuse, and threats during child \n        visitation or visitation exchanges; and\n            (3) to provide an ongoing safe haven for parents and \n        children during visitation or visitation exchanges to promote \n        continuity and stability.\n\nSEC. 2. GRANTS TO STATES TO PROVIDE FOR SUPERVISED VISITATION CENTERS.\n\n    (a) Grants to States.--The Attorney General may award grants to \nStates to enable States to enter into contracts and cooperative \nagreements with public or private nonprofit entities to assist such \nentities in establishing and operating supervised visitation centers \nfor the purposes of facilitating supervised visitation and visitation \nexchange. At least 50 percent of all grants awarded under this \nsubsection shall be used by State grantees for contracts and \ncooperative agreements with nonprofit, nongovernmental entities.\n    (b) Considerations.--In awarding grants under paragraph (1), the \nAttorney General shall take into account and in awarding contracts and \ncooperative agreements a State which received such a grant shall take \ninto account--\n            (1) the number of families to be served by the proposed \n        visitation center to be established under the grant;\n            (2) the extent to which supervised visitation centers serve \n        underserved populations as that term is defined in section \n        2003(7) of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of \n        1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796gg-2(7));\n            (3) the extent to which the applicant demonstrates \n        cooperation and collaboration with nonprofit, nongovernmental \n        entities in the local community served, including the State \n        domestic violence coalition centers and other local shelters \n        and programs for domestic violence victims, including programs \n        providing legal assistance to domestic violence victims; and\n            (4) the extent to which the applicant demonstrates \n        coordination or collaboration with State and local court \n        systems, including mechanisms for communication and referral.\n    (c) Use of Funds.--\n            (1) In general.--Amounts provided under a grant under \n        subsection (a) or provided by a State grantee under a contract \n        or cooperative agreement shall be used to establish supervised \n        visitation centers and for the purposes described in section \n        1(b). In using such amounts, grantees and persons awarded a \n        contract or cooperative agreement shall target the economically \n        disadvantaged and those individuals who could not otherwise \n        afford such visitation services. Individuals shall be permitted \n        to use the services provided by the center on a sliding fee \n        basis.\n            (2) Regulations and applicant requirements.--The Attorney \n        General shall award grants to States and States shall enter \n        into contracts and cooperative agreements under such grants in \n        accordance with such regulations as the Attorney General may \n        promulgate. The Attorney General shall give priority in \n        awarding grants and States shall give priority in awarding \n        contracts and cooperative agreements under such grants to \n        States that consider domestic violence in making a custody \n        decision. An applicant awarded a grant from the Attorney \n        General or an applicant awarded a contract or cooperative \n        agreement by a State grantee shall--\n                    (A) demonstrate recognized expertise in the area of \n                family violence and a record of high quality service to \n                victims of domestic violence;\n                    (B) demonstrate collaboration with and support of \n                the State domestic violence coalition and local \n                domestic violence shelter or program in the locality in \n                which the supervised visitation center will be \n                operated; and\n                    (C) provide long-term supervised visitation and \n                visitation exchange services to promote continuity and \n                stability.\n    (d) Reporting.--Not later than 60 days after the end of each fiscal \nyear, the Attorney General shall report to Congress information \nconcerning--\n            (1) the number of individuals served and the number of \n        individuals turned away from services categorized by State, the \n        number of individuals from underserved populations served or \n        turned away from such services, and the type of presenting \n        problems that underlie the need for supervised visitation or \n        visitation exchange, such as domestic violence, child abuse \n        emotional or other physical abuse, or a combination of such \n        factors;\n            (2) the numbers of supervised visitations or visitation \n        exchanges ordered during custody determinations under a \n        separation or divorce decree or protection order, through child \n        protection services, or through other social services agencies;\n            (3) the process by which children or abused partners are \n        protected during visitations, temporary custody transfers and \n        other activities for which the supervised visitation centers \n        are created;\n            (4) safety and security problems occurring during the \n        reporting period during supervised visitations or at visitation \n        centers including the number of parental abduction cases;\n            (5) the number of parental abduction cases in a judicial \n        district using supervised visitation services, both as \n        identified in criminal prosecution and custody violations; and\n            (6) any other appropriate information designated in \n        regulations promulgated by the Attorney General.\n    (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--\n            (1) In general.--For the purpose of awarding grants under \n        this section, there are authorized to be appropriated \n        $75,000,000 for fiscal year 1998, $85,000,000 for fiscal year \n        1999, and $95,000,000 for fiscal year 2000.\n            (2) Distribution.--Of the amounts appropriated under \n        subparagraph (A) for each fiscal year, not less than 95 percent \n        shall be used to award grants.", "output": "Safe Havens for Children Act of 1997 - Authorizes the Attorney General to award grants to States to enable them to enter into contracts and cooperative agreements with public or private nonprofit entities for the establishment and operation of supervised visitation centers.
