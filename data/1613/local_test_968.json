That's unusual, as we normally don't experience one when we have \\\"good\\\" tequila. I'm uncertain what type of tequila they use in the cadillac version, but I suspect it was still closer to \\\"rail\\\"\\n\\n+ Good chips and salsa, and they were complimentary, even though we didn't order any other food\\n\\n+ Tons of seating options\\n- Tables/chairs - looking a little dated and some were quite wobbly\\n\\nAll-in-all, this was a great option for our group, and I couldn't have been any happier than I was with the service.

They have some plates not listed on their menus due to being very authentic such as the Mexican Original Tacos that you can order them only up request. \\n\\nMy favorite dish are the carnitas (sauce-less) black beans and cilantro white rice, the guacamole is not the best but you can ask for authentic and they'll bring you guacamole, with cilantro, tomatoes, and spices in it.\\n\\nIs worth to give a shot, I assure that you'll love it.", "output": "5 stars", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 418.json"}, {"instruction": "You are given a review about a place.

They have raised their house margarita prices by $0.75 and none of their tequilas are half-off anymore (REALLY DISAPPOINTING!). They also now only have 3 or 4 featured tequilas that will apparently change up every once and awhile that are all priced at $4 a shot.\\n\\nAlso, they have their tacos individually priced on the HH menu, but you must order three at a time and you can't mix and match them either.  They also changed the recipes on the pork tacos (pray they did not change the fried fish ones, OR ELSE!) Not only that, but the tacos are not even discounted for happy hour. What. The. Hell. Whoever is running this place now obviously does not know what they are doing, because the poor waitresses have to explain the happy hour menu to every customer, new or old. \\n\\nThe ONLY positive would be the fact that the waitresses no longer have to dress in all-white outfits that looked a bit trashy. I always hated them. The new shirts are awesome, though, and I definitely want to buy one! It has that cool Dia de los Muertos sugar skull design they use on the side and the shirt itself is black. \\n\\nThis is no longer the best happy hour in Tempe.

I have been a long time fan of Giada  & was super excited to have the chance to eat at her restaurant.  After finally arriving at the restaurant  last night, I checked in with the greeter and was asked if I wanted to go in early since my wife &  I arrived early. My wife checked that the dress attire for the restaurant  is \\\"business casual\\\"  based on their website. I was wearing blue shorts &  a capped sleeved (  very short, short sleeved) Guess hooded sweater.  While waiting to be seated, another woman who didn't  introduce herself came from inside  the restaurant  & told me  that there was a dress code &  I wouldn't  be able to get in unless I changed clothes.  Being that I wasn't staying at the Cromwell, that was not something I could do.  I told this woman that I have been  a long time fan of Giada since her cooking show days and all I wanted to do was eat dinner at Giada 's restaurant for my wife' s bday.  All I wanted was a little customer service and to be pardoned for my capped sleeve shirt. She just turned her head,  gave me a  fake smile  that read \\\"that's  nice but I really don't give a shit\\\"  &  proceeded with telling me that I still won't  be able to get in unless I changed clothes.  She said I had \\\"torn off sleeves\\\"  and that was the problem. .  but mind you..  my shirt is once again CAPPED Sleeve that  go pass my shoulders and it was a Guess brand.  It was not a $10 ripped tank top from old Navy as she implied. While this is all happening, I notice  3 or 4 guys go inside to eat with blue shorts on and  t-shirts.  So here is my question...  What was the difference  between what I had on and THEIR outfits ????  \\n\\nI get that there's a dress code and rules like this need to be followed by the people  who conduct this business.  What I  didn't  appreciate was the condescending  approach and how that woman made me feel that this snobby atmosphere  is something that they're  trying to uphold & that me and my capped sleeved shirt don't have a place in there.  (Imagine that \\\"Pretty Woman\\\" scene w/Julia Roberts  when she was dressed as a hooker and that snobby lady didn't wanna help her because of how she looked.. All Julia wanted was to buy a nice dress and she had $$$!!) \\n\\nI thought that as a fan of Giada  (who this woman  probably  didn't  even know  of until she worked at the restaurant) AND as a paying customer that  a few  more inches of length  on my sleeves  wouldn't  be so  significant. I was naive. I had to seriously re-evaluate  being a fan because her establishment represents her like THIS.\\n\\nI'm sure your food is extraordinary  (I can only imagine it in the pictures because I didn't  get to taste it!!)
