garofalo screenplay by david veloz , based on the novel by jerry stahl directed by david veloz permanent midnight is a pretty bad movie , though it took me a few days to conclude this .\nthe film is more masturbatory than bleak , with its main character intent on confounding us with his stupidity .\n( he has a $ 6000 a week drug habit . )\nultimately , as adapted by veloz , jerry stahl comes off as one of those playground braggarts who chainsmokes at the age of twelve ; you are less mystified by his self - destructive nature than bored into a stupor yourself .\nben stiller plays stahl , a young author who arrives in l . a . with ambition and a nasty drug habit .\nhe eventually gets a gig for $ 5000/week writing for a sitcom called mr .\nchompers ( a thinly veiled stand - in for \" alf \" :\nchompers looks just like alf except he 's blue ) , marries a producer ( hurley ) so she can get a green card , and hooks up with a spanish mother ( liz torres ) , who shoots heroin with him in the afternoons .\ninsert proverbial downward spiral here .\npermanent midnight is structured mostly as a flashback , with recovering addict bello meeting stiller ( at a fastfood restaurant , where stiller works the drive - thru as part of rehab ) , taking him back to a hotel , and between bouts of serious screwing , listening to his life story .\ni 've spent the last week trying to figure out why stiller never seemed to find the frighteningly gorgeous hurley attractive - worse , i 've been trying to figure out why hurley did find stiller attractive .\nas stahl , stiller displays none of the charm or wit one would expect\n( post - there 's something about mary ) of either the actor or a comedy writer .\nwhat separates stahl from the hundreds of other hollywood punk - junkies , it seems , is that stahl wrote a book about his idiocy .\nwatch stahl shoot heroin next to a baby !\nwatch stahl spoil numerous pitch meetings with smack - fueled babble !\nstiller gives a technically flawless performance : the film could double as a documentary on how to be a junkie .\nbut permanent midnight is mostly soulless .\nwhen the movie poses the question will stahl be saved ?\nand then answers it in the form of bello 's character ( basically a shrink in black panties )\n, could a person care less ?\nin the film version of his autobiography of the same name , stahl does n't need saving , he needs someone who will sit there and listen to him go on about himself .\nif you learn anything about the other characters in this movie , it 's that they are the most incredibly tolerant hollywood - types known to man .\n( stahl also seems to be the only person at schmooze parties doing drugs .\nis this hollywood . . .\ncalifornia ? )\ni learned very little about the entertainment business from permanent midnight and a whole lot about an egotistical lunkhead .\nof course you know that stahl triumphed because he lived to talk about his problems .\nso , basically , his drug habit got him a book deal , a movie based on his life , and now he 's apparently collaborating with stiller on future projects .\nso much for the moral of that story .\ntemporary midnight is more like it

.\n\"\nthis movie is not about judging stephane 's actions as being right or wrong , but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are .\ni find the ending appropriate ; unfortunately , i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling .\nthis portion of the film is where the \" sense of closure \" could have been successfully accomplished .\nunfortunately , there is a hurried and almost a soap opera - type surge of emotions from all of the characters .\nwhile ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart , ravel has his day in this film .\nthe synergism of the tension of ravel 's music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen .\nthe directing in this movie is wonderful .\nthe actors and actresses are excellent , each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth .\nemmanuelle beart 's personality is beautiful .\nand needless to say , i must say that emmanuelle beart , herself , is beautiful .\nbesides the near ending , the only other criticism of the movie which i have is that the movie is almost too cerebral .\ni almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of .\nthe one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot , has their attitude towards love changed ?\ni have several possibilities which i believe the movie hints at , but i am unsure of which the director is espousing .\nin summary , this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters who almost develop a relationship .\nin the process , we see their attitude towards life and other people .\nin itself , i do not believe un coeur is a complicated movie . where it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we , as americans , have preconceived american notions of relationship , love , and people .\ni do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture .\nhowever , i , bringing my american preconceptions , enjoyed the film .\ni would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it .", "output": "P", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 481.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you must classify if a

immensely despite some flaws .\nfor anyone wishing to have the same experience i would suggest reserving judgement of the movie until viewing it in its entirety .\nthat is no easy task .\nsuperficially , it bears an unfortunate ( and not necessarily unintended ) resemblance to several other movies , notably \" return to paradise \" and \" midnight express .\n\" as a result nearly every review of \" brokedown palace \" i subsequently read became hopelessly entangled in making the obvious comparisons .\nthe consequence was nearly universal condemnation , which is a shame as\nthis is a fine film .\nfor those who have yet to view the movie , let me say that it is not an attempt to portray the nightmarish reality of the third world criminal justice system ( as was \" midnight express \" ) nor completely the moral dilemma and examination of the meaning of friendship and humanity that was the heart of \" return to paradise .\n\" in my view , if this film is to be compared to any other source it would have to be joseph conrad 's acclaimed novel , \" lord jim .\n\"\nproblematically , the basic storyline seems more than familiar : two american teenage girls on vacation are sentenced to spend most of their lives in a thai prison for drug smuggling in an obvious set - up involving a suave con - man , a shadowy criminal conspiracy and a corrupt third world \" justice \" system .\nthe girls are alice ( claire danes ) and darlene ( kate beckinsale ) .\nthey 're life - long buddies who planned a high - school graduation trip to hawaii , and then secretly changed their destination to the more exotic thailand without telling their parents .\nonce there , they find a $ 6 hotel and go sight - seeing , which includes sneaking into a luxury hotel to sip expensive drinks poolside .\nthey get caught trying to charge the bill to the wrong room , a minor transgression which will later come back to haunt them , but they are saved from hotel security by a charming , friendly australian , nick ( daniel lapaine ) , who takes care of the bill with a more polished execution of the girl 's scam .\nhe then proceeds to separate the girls and make smooth moves , first toward alice , then toward darlene .\nby now alarm bells are going off among viewers .\nthe ever - present nick is too slick and his stories do n't add up ( to us ) --the girls , of course , are too naive to notice .\nlong before it happens , we 're anticipating the inevitable disappearance of the fast - talking smuggler and the arrest of our teenaged sitting - ducks at the airport en route to hong kong caught holding the bag ( literally ) containing heroin .\njust as predictably , the thai police and courts do their part in meting out injustice and our trusting tourists are prison - bound for a long stretch .\nleft unanswered is the red herring issue of whether one or the other of the girls was a willing accomplice .\nfor those in need of a ready answer , might i suggest closer scrutiny of the bell hop at the girl 's fleabag hotel .\nas one door after another to their comfortable former life is closed , the girls and their families turn in desperation to the noiresque expatriate lawyer / fixer \" yankee hank \" ( bill pullam ) and his thai - born partner - wife .\na recurring element of the movie is the tension between appearance and reality as expressed in one of the film 's tag lines , \" who do you trust ? , \" and hank is no exception although seasoned movie- goers and those familiar with pullman 's oeuvre will find few surprises .\nmuch of the remainder of the movie is a smorgasbord of intriguing themes incompletely explored in short - hand fashion .\nlou diamond phillips , for instance , plays a delightfully sinister and callous dea agent who , while appearing to be casually accommodating to hank , withholds vital information at crucial moments .\nis he part of a wider conspiracy ? with an inherently powerful , if somewhat tired premise , the film offers by parts a riveting courtroom drama , a prison story , and a potential character study of american teens , their relationship , and what constitutes friendship between them .\nthe result is reasonably engaging and suspenseful , with the girls ' interaction , hank 's investigation , and the various trials and hearings , offering hope for their release , delivering tension -- as does the foredoomed possibility of their escape .\nif \" brokedown palace \" has a major flaw , it is its creators ' tendency , like time - constrained tourists , to take frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only to reverse direction half - way down and return to the story 's main avenue .\nand , if that were all there was to \" brokedown palace , \" it would n't be a very good movie .\nbut i believe the writers and director were after bigger game and , in this , they succeeded .\nfor the main theme of the movie , like the proffered name of its location , is freedom -- in all its permutations .\nultimately , the other sub - themes may be considered window dressing .\nyoung and pretty , alice ( danes ) is an old soul ; a wild , streetwise teenager with a thirst for freedom and adventure .\npresented as a perfect blend of yin and yang , dark and light , is her cautious best friend , darlene ( beckinsale ) .\nclear - eyed and straightforward , alice is more complex than her friend .\nshe comes from a poorer background , has a reputation for getting into trouble and has lost the trust of everyone ( including her own father ) .\nwhereas darlene 's life is \" on - track , \" aimed at college , marriage , kids , a career , a suburban home , middle age and \" fulfillment , \" alice 's is uncertain , unfocused , and yearning .\none poignant scene in the film shows darlene shouting across an open moat to visitors -- friends and relatives from home , whose lives continue while hers is in limbo .\ntellingly , alice is present but not included .\njust as revealing of their different personalities , when alice and dar first come to thailand , the openness and delight on alice 's face does n't read as simple naivet ?\n; the way she stands up and stretches as she and her friend ride along in a small boat , reaching toward the sun , she really is drinking in what she believes to be freedom , while \" dar \" remains seated in the shade .\n\"\nbrokedown palace \" begins with an admission by alice of her guilt in a tape recording sent to hank .\nhowever unintentional , it 's all alice 's fault .\nshe 's responsible for persuading her friend to lie to her parents , to sneak away from the safety of hawaii to the perils of thailand , to try the petty scam which places them in the clutches of the evil nick .\n( in case one misses this point in the inevitable confusion of a film 's beginning , darlene obligingly reminds alice of her culpability in prison . )\ndar , of course , is the willing dupe which , in her view , confers innocence .\nnever mind that it was her coercion of a reluctant alice to accompany her to hong kong which placed them in police custody in the first place or that her naive confession sealed their fate .\ndar is innocent .\nit does n't matter .\nalice is the subject of this movie .\nshe and her journey toward personal freedom .\nalong the way we are treated to an unsympathetic portrait of the shallow american culture which created these girls with their half - baked sensibilities and materialistic goals .\nin the end , that culture , like its representatives , \" yankee \" hank and dar 's father ( a \" man who knows how to grease the wheels \" ) , proves as impotent as its government in the face of the girl 's tragedy .\nthailand 's culture , contrary to most opinion , comes off much better by comparison .\nit amazes me that reviewers argued this point at both extremes .\ni believe the filmmaker 's view was that thai culture is vastly different from the american but not necessarily inferior .\nthe thai ( with the sole exceptions of a corrupt official and a spiteful prison spy ) were uniformly consistent in their behavior and true to their principles .\nthe girls were shown to be treated no better but certainly no worse than the native - born .\ntheir prison ( in stark contrast to the probable reality ) was no hellhole , being relatively clean and sunlit .\nthe prison authorities demanded good hygiene , provided medical care when needed , and \" hard manual labor \" consisted of picking grass !\nthe thai guards were authoritarian ( what else ? )\nbut certainly not routinely sadistic .\nas for the thai justice system , the reasoning of the thai judges , during both an appeal hearing and in the film 's penultimate scene was devastating in its logic and morality .\n' freedom ' has many faces and \" brokedown palace \" explores many of them .\nin the extreme , we have freedom of the body and freedom of the spirit .\nsome settle for the former alone while others remain imprisoned with an entire nation to roam without the latter .\nbut freedom seldom comes without a price .\nwhich is why the movie 's other tag lines are : \" what is your dream ?\n\" and \" how far would you go ?\n\"\ni believe i could make a good case for the interpretation that the person who attains freedom , incarcerated or not , by film 's end is alice .\nshe finds redemption and salvation through the acceptance of personal responsibility .\ni think the light bathing only her figure among the assembled prisoners in the final scene visually signals that fact .\nkate beckinsale 's character might more properly be likened to the \" released \" temple bird referred to twice during the film , \" trained to fly back to its cage .\n\" as the thai magistrate observed in the film 's climactic scene , the issue was always one of \" character ; \" and the jamaican prisoner made it clear that \" freedom \" is achieved within oneself . if one thinks back over the movie , which character was transformed by their experiences ?\nincreasingly , the cinema landscape seems to have become littered with endless permutations of ' kung fu woman'--female characters virtually indistinguishable from male action figures .\nhere , at last , is the story of a modern heroine .\nin reading the many user 's comments , i was struck by what seems an unusual phenomenon : whether or not a person liked the movie ,\nalmost everyone praised the actors .\nthink about that .\nwhen was the last time you came away from a motion picture possibly hating it , but raving about all the performances in it ?\ndo yourself a favor :

should move back in with his mother for a while just to see what kinds of feelings come out , and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is .\n\"\na great experiment \" , he calls it .\nbrooks ' own brand of humor really shines in this film , especially in the interaction john has with his mother .\nthere 's a scene where john has just arrived at his mother 's house , and after

to get mad at her character .\nthis only helps the audience to share the frustration john feels when dealing with her .\nas his first choice , brooks originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice , but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband , who was beginning to show symptoms of alzheimer 's disease .\nthat may be just as well ,

impoverished labour .\nwhatever intentions wells had , the future generations of readers were less impressed by his political messages .\ninstead they were fascinated by the idea that the strange new worlds could be explored without traveling trough space .\nthe novel became one of great classics of science fiction genre and it natural for filmmakers to use it as inspiration .\nfirst of them was george pal , who in 1960 directed film which would , through the years , become genre classic of its own .\nthe plot revolves about george ( rod taylor ) , victorian scientist who discovered the way

burning issues and fears of their respective times . for h .\ng .\nwells\nit was frightening threat of class struggle ; for george pal and his screenwriter david duncan , who produced the film in the worst days of the cold war , it was the constant and more imminent threat of nuclear holocaust , underlined with the negative references to war throughout the movie .\neven the modern audience , which would be tempted to discard the film as old - fashioned , could find some values in its universal messages , fit for each era .\ncompared with the genre films of today , the time machine is even

form of classic adventure , sometimes sacrificing plausibility for the sake of attractiveness .\nfor example , it is hard to imagine that someone would be able to understand perfect english million years in future ; same is with morlocs degenerating into mutant monsters , while eloi remain undistinguished from the people of today .\nsome of the final scenes , that turn victorian scientist into

dropped , and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features , they are nearly always destined to do no more than the same .\nhowever , while the success of a disney animated feature is generally a given as far as box - office receipts , merchandising dollars , and glimmers in the eyes of little children , critically they are as varied as anything else that hollywood has to offer .\nluckily , disney 's latest animated offering , mulan , manages to be engaging and refreshing , even while rife with formula .\nthe film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns , led by the imposing shan - yu ( miguel ferrer ) .\nsoon , china 's emperor ( pat morita ) mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the country shall serve to fight in china 's defense .\nwhen the fa family is served notice , it is the elderly father , fa zhou\n( soon - tek oh ) who must answer the call , as there are no other males in the household .\nfearing her father will surely be killed in battle , fa mulan ( ming - na wen ) disguises herself as a man and sneaks off with the royal orders to join the chinese army .\nmulan , based on a chinese epic poem , is a classic tale of the triumph of the ugly duckling .\nmulan herself is a disgrace to her loving family , as she has a difficult time fitting into the traditional woman 's role , and in a very amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts to assess her value to a potential husband , we see that \" grace \" is not one of her strong points .\nvery early on , we are presented with the high importance of bringing honor to one 's family , and by botching her chance at gaining the favor of the matchmaker , mulan fails at that task .\nby leaving home to fight in her father 's place , she may not only spare his life , but bring honor , too .\nas is the case with most disney musicals , the songs are first rate and pervasive throughout the film .\ni 'm not sure if they will get much airplay , but at least one of the songs will no doubt receive recognition come oscar time .\nboth lea salonga , who provides the singing voice for mulan , and donny osmond who sings for shang , the captain of mulan 's army unit and obligatory love interest ,\nare more than competent , although salonga 's voice translates much better to animation .\nyou have to hear it to understand .\ninterestingly , the musical numbers which are so often done with big flourishes are surprisingly muted in mulan .\nthere is no significantly big number , which is customary as the second or third song in a disney film , but this does not detract significantly from the rest of the movie .\nit is , however , an expectation which has been built by disney 's own formulaic history , and some viewers may feel as if something is missing .\nartistically , the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork , and although this may not live up to the vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works , it helps to contribute a more authentic , and therefore more credible , nature to what otherwise may be seen as a typically \" disneyfied \" ethnic tale .\nthere are also a couple of visually standout scenes , one involving the charge of shan - yu 's hun army , which utilizes the same computer - enhanced imagery disney animators have employed since the chandelier in beauty and the beast .\nthe other scene worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it .\nwhen mulan resolves to take her father 's place , she dons her father 's old battle armor , and unsheathes a sword .\nas she does so , you can see her reflection in the polished metal .\nit just left me thinking ,\n\" that was really cool . \" a wonderful range of performances delight the audience\nthroughout the film , varying from the straight , such as soon - tek\noh as fa zhou , to the comical , such as harvey fierstein as yao , a gruff , pugilistic member of shang 's conscripted army .\neven more outrageous is eddie murphy as mushu , the diminutive guardian dragon sent to look after mulan .\nalthough an obvious attempt to relive the chemistry brought forth by robin williams in aladdin , murphy nevertheless distinguishes himself with his own winning performance .\ni found the choice of b .\nd .\nwong as shang a little strange ( you may remember him as martin short 's wedding planner assistant in the father of the bride ) , but they used robbie benson for the voice of the beast in beauty and the beast , so i guess anything 's possible .\nin any event , wong performs admirably as well .\none character which provides a significant amount of humor is grandmother fa .\nshe deserves recognition not only because of the levity she brings to the movie , but also because she is voiced by two very remarkable people .\njune foray , who supplies grandmother fa 's speaking voice , is a venerable voice actress who may be best known for her work as rocky the squirrel and natasha fatale ( as in boris and natasha ) .\nmarni nixon , who provides grandmother fa 's singing voice , is the same vocalist who dubbed the voices for anna in the king and i , maria in west side story , and eliza in my fair lady .\nwith this in mind , hearing grandmother fa is like listening to a little piece of history .\nmulan is the latest disney animated feature to get away from some of the eurocentrism which for so long dominated disney films .\nin an effort to be culturally sensitive ( and to avoid a \" miss saigon \" -type debacle ) , disney has also wisely chosen to employ many asian - american actors for both lead and supporting roles .\nin addition to the actors already mentioned , the cast includes such ubiquitous talents as james hong , gedde watanabe , james shigeta , and george takei .\ni guess clyde kusatsu was n't available .\nat a running time of slightly under an hour and a half , mulan moves quickly and provides solid entertainment

way high school jocks actually behave ( or , perhaps , this is the only realistic element in the film ) .\nmuch of the writing is simply bad , and rosenberg has no intuition when it comes to the way high school kids act . in one terrible scene , gavin explains to steve all of the high school cliques , while pointing them out in the cafeteria .\nup front , i should say that , in four years of high school , i did not eat in the cafeteria even once .\nthat aside , the various social groups he points out are general , uninteresting , and poorly - shown .\nfor instance , he points to the \" nerds , \" who are all wearing glasses and playing with their laptops .\nit 's such an obvious cliche that i ca n't believe rosenberg even bothered .\nmost of the dialogue is forced ( no one says , \" bite me !\n\" anymore ) , and none of the scenes have any degree of wit .\nthis picture is not inspired , and most scenes flop from one to the other , with no sense of momentum or energy .\nthe blame for this can be placed on director david nutter , who apparently likes his films dry .\nhorror films should at least exploit violence , but this one is shockingly timid .\nthere are a few good scenes , though , such as an interesting trip through an insane asylum ( this is , however , the most forced scene in the film , for how our heroes get there or why they bother are things we never learn ) .\ni also liked the school janitor character , played by william sadler .\nhe has a few lines that are surprisingly thought - provoking .\nthe acting is largely a waste of talent .\nmarsden is , as i said , bland ( thought not particularly bad ) .\nbruce greenwood is shamelessly wasted .\nstahl and holmes both show they have talent , but the direction is n't good enough to hone in on their skills\n( stahl 's performance seems more like a parody of high school potheads ) .\nnone of these characters expand beyond their one dimension , and , frankly , watching cardboard cut - outs of human beings

who read this script and thought that it would make a good film , or that it would make a lot of money at the box office .\nit 's not boring , or even blatantly awful , but\nit 's an uninspired lump of a film .\nit sure starts off nicely , but the regression into total absurdity is so consistent that the very last scene is outright laughable\n.\nso , if you go to see this film , take my advice :

effects monsters\nlike the one lurking in the bowels of a luxury liner in deep rising ?\nthe obvious answer to this question is cardboard , because that 's the depth of the most fully- developed character in this painfully generic creature feature .\ndeep rising demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something scripted by a computer .\nin fact , considering the rigid adherence to the expected formulas , perhaps it was .\nthe most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore .\nnot since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh ( both human and non - human ) been scattered in all directions .\nwe learn some bloody trivia , as well , such as how a sea monster spraypaints in red ( it drinks a human being then spits out the liquefied remains ) and what it does with half - digested leftovers .\ni suppose deep rising 's gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who love the macabre , but it does n't do much for me .\non the surface , and that 's about the only level at which this film can be analyzed , deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic ( everyone else is citing the equally valid aliens / titanic connection , since james cameron directed both ) .\nin going for the big disaster angle of titanic and the tongue - in - cheek mayhem of tremors , deep rising somehow misses both marks by a wide margin .\nthe film is not humorous , tense , or exciting .\nin fact , it 's downright boring , and , despite being half the length of cameron 's current box - office champ , deep rising feels like the longer movie .\nis it really necessary to say anything about the plot ?\nprobably not , since it 's easy to guess ,\nbut i 'll go ahead and oblige anyone who wants a synopsis .\nthe film opens by introducing us to a gang of bad guys on board a mercenary ship .\nin addition to the usual cast of psychopaths and lunatics , there 's finnegan ( treat williams ) , the boat 's pilot , who 's supposed to be an indiana jones knockoff ; joey ( kevin\nj .\no'connor ) , the inept sidekick who 's supposed to be lovable and funny ( but is really just irritating ) ; and hanover ( wes studi ) , the \" mastermind \" ( and i use that term lightly ) of the operation .\ntheir goal : attack a cruise ship , clean out the safe , then sink it using some illegally - acquired torpedoes .\nthe problem is , by the time they reach the argonautica , the titanic - like luxury liner has turned into the marie celeste .\naside from a beautiful jewel thief ( famke janssen ) and a couple of crew members , there 's no one on board .\nthe reason soon becomes obvious -- the ship has been taken over by a bad special effect that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth and more than eight tentacles .\nthe cast , which is led by treat williams , is primarily comprised of has - beens and probably - never - will - bes ( two exceptions : wes studi , best known as the villain in the last of the mohicans , and djimon hounsou , amistad 's cinque ) .\nwilliams , once a \" ca n't miss \" prospect in hollywood , has fallen so far out of favor\nthat the best he can do these days for a lead role is a film like deep rising , and his inability to create a charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career .\nfamke janssen , who will forever be known as xenia onatopp from goldeneye , is the perfect bland match for williams .\ngiven her limited acting abilities , it 's likely that she was chosen for this part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes .\nunfortunately , a bra defeats the purpose of having her in a wet tee - shirt for half of the picture .\nmeanwhile , kevin j .\no'connor , who has entirely too much screen time , exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching a blackboard .\nthese days , audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with computer - generated special effects .\nthis is a lesson that writer / director stephen sommers ( who previously helmed the live - action jungle book ) needs to learn .\nthe days of jurassic park , when viewers were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big and imposing on screen , are past .\nnow , movie - goers are looking for the sophistication of titanic -- visuals that are so well - incorporated that it 's impossible to tell where they end and where \" reality \" begins .\nin deep rising , the monster , like everything , is artificial and unconvincing .\nunfortunately , the fundamental problem audiences are faced with here is n't so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture , but the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre\n( although , to be fair , deep rising is a particularly bad entry ) .\neven once this film has sunk out of sight , the knowledgeable viewer knows it wo n't be the last of its kind .\nlike the slimy , slithering things that inhabit the air vents and pipes of these movies , more are waiting just around

completely unrelated to john williams ' classic superman theme and sounds better suited for a cannon films ' golan - globus production ) .\nthe commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco is a step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries .\nbosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl and is there with szwarc to ensure that there 's no dead air on the track .\nbosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen , and we learn a great deal more about the film as a result of his participation

stands , superman is written off early on in the film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission .\nfor the sake of brevity , i wo n't even get into that one .\nszwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds ( and everyone else agreed ) that supergirl needed to stand on its own , replacing the science fiction of the superman films with cutsy \" whimsical fantasy \" nonsense .\nbosco also points out scenes not in the american release as they come along , claiming that had they been in the original release

going to strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the film .\nso , it 's up to the u\n. s .\ngovernment to stop it .\n( why the u . s .\nis always exclusively saddled with these problems is never fully investigated . )\ntheir plan -- to send a group of experienced oil drillers up to the asteroid , drill down several hundred feet , and detonate a nuclear warhead within .\nthe head driller is harry stamper ( bruce willis ) .\nhis group of men is a colorful bunch , including a .\nj .\n( ben affleck ) , chick ( will patton ) , and rockhound ( steve buscemi ) .\nthere 's also an interesting triangle formed between a .\nj . , harry , and grace ( liv tyler ) , who is harry 's daughter .\na .\nj .\nand grace are , of course , romantically intertwined , and dad is n't too happy with the situation .\nit 's absurd to wish for a complicated story in an event movie or a special effects movie or\nwhatever it is you 'd like to call armageddon .\nit 's not about story -- it 's about viscera and action , and thrills - a - minute , and all that stuff .\nit 's incidental , really , that the story is cohesive and even remotely believable , because most people will be too wrapped up in the explosions to give two seconds ' thought to what actually happens .\nbut bay is the one to congratulate in this case , for he has made a film\nso entertaining and so visually sharp\nthat i doubt any director could have done it better .\ni think most of the budget went to cameras alone , because bay films every action sequence from about thirty or forty different angles .\ntake the spectacular opening scene , for instance , in which a meteor shower obliterates new york .\na meteor flies out of the sky and crashes into a building , which sends fireballs erupting into the air and cars spinning like tops upon other cars .\nthe action itself might take five seconds in real life , but bay edits so quickly that we get the same scene in six different ways .\ni like his quick - edit style , because it 's abrasive and exhausting to watch .\nit 's also very loud , and obnoxiously noisy at times .\nbut it 's fun to be obnoxious sometimes .\nthe special effects in this film put every other 1998 blockbuster to shame .\ndeep impact , visually , has absolutely nothing on armageddon , and to offer a comparison between the quality of this film and godzilla is simply laughable .\nspecial effects are very important in a film like this : if they 're not good , then the image is not convincing , and the film does n't work .\neverything here looks bright and explosive\n-- from the little meteors bursting through skyscrapers , all the way to the shots of the earth through the jutting rocks on the ominously approaching asteroid .\nthe effects that do n't look totally real are still a pleasure to behold , and i credit everyone involved for creating the first blockbuster\nso nice - looking that it actually qualifies as art\n.\nof course , all of this would add up to little more than an above - average light show , if i did n't get the feeling that bay cares as much about his characters as he does about his action .\nthe film is two and a half hours long , and not all of that is spent submerged in numbing action .\nmuch of the film is dedicated to developing the various characters ' subplots .\ni wo n't suggest that these are complex characters , but their problems are real , and the emotions are n't put forth in a sentimental and overbearing way .\nin fact , there are three or four scenes here that had me pretty choked up , and that 's a lot more than i can say about deep impact , which was banking on the feel - good parts of its story .\nbruce willis is terrific , and i 'm glad to see him bigger than life again ( recent turns in films like mercury rising have been very disappointing ) .\ntyler and affleck are great together , and make a convincing couple -- all of the scenes between them work on a comfortable level .\npatton , who is a magnificent actor , thankfully is not wasted here , and the minor subplot revolving around his ex - wife and son is very moving\n.\nthe comic relief from buscemi and peter stormare ( who plays a crazy russian astronaut ) is nifty , and keeps the film lively and funny\n.\ni was n't challenged to think real hard while watching armageddon , and i do n't mind too much .\nbut the film does n't insult my intelligence -- it 's pitched perfectly to entertain , which is what all it really wants to do .\nit 's not mindless and escapist , but well - crafted cinema .\nit might have been created for the wrong reasons , but men like michael bay have my respect for showing me that they are interested in making something good , in spite of the producers and the budget .\ni 'm not saying that films like this are risky moves .\nwhat i am saying is that armageddon is a big , loud , expensive motion picture that reminds me that art often comes in the strangest of forms

- handedly takes out a small army of terrorists , and then must escape in the nick of time by flying away in a fighter jet while the co - pilot tries to strangle him and a terrorist in another jet tries to shoot him down !\nthis might sound like the kind of cliches films like this are notorious for ( over- ) using , but it works here because the film knows how to get our attention quickly .\nit 's not about the payoff because it 's obvious bond will escape , instead , it 's the way it processes the action sequences by going over the top and not apologizing for it , all the while creating for witty , hysterical comedy .\nit seems less emphasis is placed on the villains in thrillers anymore , because of political correctness , and just plain copping - out on behalf of the filmmakers ( even the term \" villain \" sounds passe ) .\nwhat the film deserves kudos for is its ability to create a villain as heinous as they come , yet making him seem completely plausible .\njonathon pryce delivers a perfect performance\nas the arrogant , cunning elliot carver , a media mogul whose goal is to take over the world , that is , through his massive media empire , not through nuclear weapons .\nthrough some interesting detective work , bond and the english ministry of defense believe carver is behind the trouble brewing in the southern asian seas as a way to create and accurately cover his own news .\nnot only is that an original idea for a conflict , but one which could carry over into reality .\nsurprisingly , this is about as detailed as the story allows the specific plot to become .\nthe film 's hook is the action , and of course those cool gadgets\nand we get plenty of that here as bond goes out to investigate carver and finds himself in a jam or two along the way

that action - adventure and science - fiction / action movies are now judged by the character of their light and noise .\nwhereas classic adventure pics of the last twenty years , such as raiders of the lost ark , were made in grand traditional fashion ; contemporary films like jurassic park are multimillion - dollar creations of computer technology .\nthe latest in this visually awesome series of movies , the wachowski brothers ' the matrix , is a testament to the skilled use of special effects and its ability to enhance a movie 's story .\nunlike many sci - fi movies which promote themselves as effects - heavy blockbusters but fail to deliver on that promise , the matrix is a carefully constructed special effects event .\nit runs 135 minutes in length and employs a countless number of computerized tricks which range from gimmick to grandiose , and the quality of the effects remains constant throughout the film 's length .\ncontrary to popular trend , the matrix commits itself to being a spectacle of light and sound .\nin this regard , the movie is something like a card sharp .\nwith its flashy mass stripped away , the matrix would be quite shallow and untalented .\nthe script is characteristically weak , and the dialogue suffers in lieu of a far more innovative visual approach .\nbut , like the card sharp , the matrix wows its audience to such a high degree that actual content is irrelevent .\nthe viewers do n't care about what the matrix has to say as long as the next special effects sequence is right around the corner .\nand right around the corner they usually are , for the script tells a fast - paced , albeit frequently revisited story .\nas the movie explains , the world as we know it is nothing but an elaborate computer program constructed by an artificial intelligence for the purpose of placating mankind .\nbillions of human beings lie in this dormant state while the intelligence -- the matrix -- \" farms \" our life energy .\nonly a

computer expert named neo ( keanu reeves ) , believing he is a prophesied individual who will help them overthrow the matrix and return peace to earth .\nthe cast plays out this story in stylish fashion .\nthe set design is very dynamic , running the gambit between cramped and dreary to bright and airy .\nthe costumes , as well as the actors who wear them , add to the roles .\nfor instance , the manifested antagonists in the movie , a group of \" agents \" created by the matrix in its computer program , all dress in matching secret servicewear ; the rebel fighters , on the other hand , dress in rich hues of leather .\nthe casting can not be criticized , for the typically stoic reeves is n't required to say much and laurence fishburne gets plenty of time to be so damn cool .\nsupports in carrie - anne moss , joe pantoliano , and hugo weaving are all effectual .\none of the best comparisons to thw matrix is last year 's science fiction masterpiece dark city , particularly if one ponders how this same premise would 've worked from a different approach .\nthe alex proyas film was far more dark and introspective , requiring a bit of thought before themes became clear ; here , the wachowski brothers have managed to construct a thrill - ride motion picture with little abandon and much noise .\nthe better picture between the two depends on the viewer ,

into play , and he looks unsure of his place the entire movie .\nespecially when he resorts to martial arts during the final showdown , and has a fight with willis that would look right at home in a jackie chan film .\nthings get more bizarre when we 're introduced to his team of rejects named after chocolate bars , including future nypd blue star david caruso as the speechless , card - flipping

disconnects potential audience identification .\nlazy viewers ( and critics ) may also complain that knowledge of french history is required for enjoyment of the lady and the duke .\nthat 's foolery ,

's a lot of violence and gore that children should not be seeing if they 're watching a cartoon .\nso is the film for adults ?\nif so , we probably do n't need to be bashed over the head to get the

footage .\nthere is absolutely no connection made between the armies of evil and the third reich , and\nwe 're not even given a cursory explanation as to why this stuff is inspiring in the first place .\nthis needed to be thought out much more thoroughly if a point were to be made , since subject matter such as this deserves better treatment .\ni 'd like to assume that bakshi was trying to say that

of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned .\nit 's startling to consider that it was only a few years ago that film distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order to give the annual disney animated feature juggernaut a wide berth .\nthe lion king had just cracked $ 300 million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history , continuing to build on a sturdy base left by prior flicks aladdin and beauty and the beast .\nsince then , though , disney 's animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns , with pocahontas , the hunchback of notre dame , and this year 's hercules successively proving less and less potent .\nwith the once seemingly - impregnable disney stranglehold on the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable , and faced with their first serious competition in the animated film market from fox 's anastasia , disney has brought xmas home early by dusting off the feature which sparked the modern revival of feature animation , the little mermaid .\nwhile the animation for the film is , as is typically the case for disney films , unquestionably top - notch , the magic in the little mermaid is not its animation , but\nthe wonderful innocence of its story and its rousingly superb music .\nthe film 's storyline is fairly straightforward -- young teen falls for handsome man , father disapproves and assigns hapless chaperone to his daughter , teen disobeys father and goes to desperate lengths to win her man -- except in this case , the chaperone is a crab , the teen is a young mermaid , and the object of her desire is a human prince .\nwhat makes the little mermaid so affecting and so emotionally resonant is the richness and charm of its characters and the sheer clarity and honest simplicity of their emotions .\nfrom the moment mermaid ariel lays her eyes on prince eric , she 's resolutely smitten , and she 's such a pure and endearing character that one ca n't help but invest their heart with her .\nthis simple but touching love story , coupled with a healthy dose of smart humour , makes the little mermaid a remarkably captivating picture .\none of the interesting things about the little mermaid is something which now curiously dates it : the voices cast for its motley crew of characters .\nthis film was produced just before the distracting concept of using celebrity voices became in vogue , which started to a certain degree with beauty and the beast and was irrevocably exacerbated by robin williams ' much - heralded turn in aladdin ; by the release of the lion king and henceforth , the majority of characters in the animated films were voiced by celebrities .\nwhile it 's understandable that animated features lacking the name - recognition or drawing power of disney ( say , balto 's use of kevin bacon and bridget fonda , or even anastasia 's showcasing of meg ryan and john cusack ) would be forced to turn to this strategy in order to hype their products , it 's unfortunate that even disney has embraced this policy .\ndo we really need to hear , say , demi moore as esmerelda in the hunchback of notre dame ?\nis the film 's entertainment value really augmented by hearing a recognizable voice , rather than a voice which best suits the role ?\n( i 'm not exactly on the edge of my seat for eddie murphy in the upcoming mulan . )\nfortunately , the performers who voice the characters in the little mermaid , although perhaps more obscure , are impeccably cast .\nchief among them is jodi benson , a 1992 tony nominee for her stage work in crazy for you , who voices the film 's heroine ariel to perfection ; with a wonderfully expressive speaking voice full of youthful vigor , and gorgeous singing voice , ms .\nbenson provides a most engaging anchor for the film .\n( she 's the only reason i 'd even consider catching flubber . )\nsimilarly , samuel e . wright is terrific\nin the showy role of sebastian , the weary guardian crab .\nhe easily milks his lovable character 's comic moments for all they 're worth , and his rendering of two of the little mermaid 's big tunes -- \" under the sea \" and \" kiss the girl \" -- have become the stuff of legend .\npat carrol is deliciously villainous and vampy as the evil sea - witch ursula ,\nwhile kenneth mars ' booming voice conveys the stern yet affectionate authority of ariel 's father , king triton .\nin large roles and small ( edie mcclurg as dotting busybody carlotta is ideal , and rene auberjonois has great fun with his exuberant french chef ) , the little mermaid is impeccably cast .\nof course , the little mermaid will probably be best remembered for its remarkable collection of songs composed by the songwriting team of alan menken ( music ) and howard ashman ( lyrics ) , who had created little shop of horrors and would go on to compose beauty and the beast and aladdin for disney before mr .\nashman 's untimely death .\nnot only are mr .\nmenken 's tunes unbearably catchy , but mr .\nashman 's charming lyrics are fully integrated into the film 's storyline so that the songs are a virtual extension of the character 's dialogue , and consequently work wonderfully within the context of the film .\nmr .\nmenken 's score for the film is equally top - notch ;\nthe sequence where eric ( voiced by christopher daniel barnes ) and ariel tour his kingdom in a horse - drawn carriage becomes magical and wondrous with mr .\nmenken 's fine score .\nit appears that most people prefer the delightfully colourful production number for the calypso - styled \" under the sea \" as joyfully crooned by mr .\nwright , which won the academy award and golden globe awards for best song -- indeed , one of the many little joys in screening the film during its re - release was listening to children scattered throughout the audience singing along with the tune -- but\nmy favourite is ms .\nbenson 's heartfelt rendition of the ballad \" part of your world \" , an achingly beautiful tune of yearning and hope ( wonderfully lyricized by mr .\nashman ) which , accompanied by the film 's most dazzlingly polished animation sequence , packs an emotional wallop which literally brought tears to my eyes\n.\nduring the song 's reprise , which builds to a crescendo with ariel arching on a rock as a wave crashes in , the cumulative effect is nothing short of breathtaking , and one becomes acutely aware that this single instance is one of the finest in animation history .\nas of this writing , november 1997 has come to an end , as has disney 's limited 17-day re - release of the little mermaid .\nthere 's no question that the primary motivation for , if not the film 's reissue itself , at least its timing , was to reinforce disney 's dominance in the animation market and provide direct competition to fox 's costly new upstart animation division and their first major venture , anastasia .\nin every respect , the re - release of the little mermaid appears to be a success -- the film 's 1997 grosses have pushed its cumulative domestic gross over the magic $ 100 million mark ; the little mermaid proved to have remarkably strong drawing power for a film initially released only eight years ago and in many homes on video , pulling in close to $ 10 million in its opening weekend ; and although nobody could possibly expect the little mermaid to possibly defeat the aggressively - marketed anastasia in head - to - head competition , it siphoned enough from the fox film 's opening weekend totals to keep anastasia from the coveted weekend leader spot , allowing for disney 's odious flubber to sweep in on the subsequent week and wrestle the family demographic market share away .\nbut although disney 's motives in the reissue of the little mermaid were self - serving and protectionist , the real winner is the public .\nany reason to put this film back into theatres is a good one , and it 's a true joy to see this heartwarming gem back on the silver screen\n.\nthe little mermaid is the best film to come out of the disney 's modern animation renaissance , and one of the greatest animated films ever made .",

known to most american audiences , but perhaps it should be .\noshii was the director of last year 's best - known japanese animated film import ,\n_ ghost in the shell _ , and is known among fans of japanese animation , or anime , for making films with a deep philosophical bent .\none of these films was the first theatrical venture for the patlabor animated series .\nin its many incarnations -- graphic novels ( \" manga \" ) , two different runs of made - for - video episodes ( original animation videos , or oavs for short ) , and a television series running to nearly fifty episodes -- patlabor has proven to be one of the most popular series ever in japan .\nset in the very near future ( though it was a somewhat farther away near future when the series was first conceived ) , this atypical giant robot anime features the characters , rather than the machinery , as the primary focus .\nas a whole , patlabor is the story of an exciting time for japan .\nas the prologue to each episode of the television series explains , giant industrial robots , known as \" labors \" ( an interesting play on words , considering that \" robot \" is derived from the czech word for labor ) , have come into widespread use in japan toward the close of the twentieth century .\nwith the rise of labors , however , has come a new menace -- labor crime .\nthis led to the creation of the two special vehicle divisions , using patrol labors to fight labor crime .\nthe patlabor story centers around the second special vehicle division , sv2 , who , through no fault of their own , have acquired a bad reputation for destructiveness .\nsometimes utterly hilarious , sometimes almost deadly serious , the patlabor series explores the interpersonal relationships of the special vehicle crewmembers , and also looks at the effects of technology on modern life .\nthose who are unfamiliar with the patlabor story and characters may find themselves slightly confused coming into the movie , although there is ample background exposition provided for new viewers .\nthe story , as has much of patlabor before , centers around the controversial babylon project , a gigantic seawall that will , on its completion , allow the reclamation of thousands of square miles of land from tokyo bay .\nthis project has been an almost constant target of environmentalist terrorists , most notably the house of sea organization .\nhowever , the threat in this case comes not from any terrorist , but from someone who is already dead . . .\nshinohara heavy industries , the premier labor manufacturer in japan ( if not the whole world ) , has just come out with a new operating system that increases labors ' movement speed and efficiency by 30 % .\nthis hyper operating system , hos for short , has very quickly been installed into well over 90 % of the nation 's labors . . .\nincluding the patrol labors of sv2 .\nsince that installation , dozens of labors , including a heavily - armed military model , have begun to go on berzerk rampages for no apparent reason . . .\nand the only factor they all had in common was that they were all running under the new hos .\n( some wags have compared this to windows 95 . )\nit 's up to asuma shinohara , labor command officer with sv2 and the son of the president of shinohara heavy industries , to find the source of these problems before more labors -- including sv2 's own -- fall victim to them , and before hos drags his father 's company down with it .\nas was the case with _ ghost in the shell\n_\n, if you just want a no - brainer actionfest , this might not be the movie for you .\n_ patlabor\n: the movie _ is more of a psychological thriller , a technological suspense drama .\nit is closer , perhaps , to a chrichton novel than to an action movie ( crichton novels that have been made _ into _ action movies notwithstanding ) .\nthere are long , thoughtful montages of dialogueless footage as two investigators make their way through slums and derelict housing in old quarters of tokyo , similar to sequences from _ ghost in the shell\n_ .\nthis movie is fraught with symbolism -- in fact a large part of it is based on christian symbolism .\npatlabor 's near - future setting is , aside from the giant robots tromping around , very similar to our own present day .\nthe film uses this setting to make its central point : is progress moving too fast for humans to keep up ? are history and culture falling by the wayside like the old buildings that are being torn down and replaced with new ?\nthis is a question just as applicable to today as it is to patlabor 's alternate-1999 setting . as far as the technical aspects of the film go ( referring to the subtitled version , as that 's the only one i 've seen ) ,\nthe film transfer is clear , almost phenomenally so .\nthe animation quality is incredible , though the character design is different from what most patlabor fans will be used to .\nthe oavs and tv series were more cheerful , better - suited to humor ; the movie , however , makes everyone look a great deal less cute , and emphasizes that this is going to be , for the most part , a deadly serious storyline . as far as cinematography goes ,\nthere are many interesting moments in _ patlabor :\nthe movie _ .\ni do n't think i can recall ever seeing a fish - eye perspective used in any other animated film ( save for _ ghost in the shell _ , another oshii film ) , or indeed , in many other movies at all .\nthe cinematography is well - suited to the storyline , emphasizing what it needs to , though a couple of scenes ( where characters ' features are exaggerated in anger ) may seem slightly strange to western audiences .\nthe audio track of _ patlabor : the movie _ is in glorious hi - fi stereo , and should be used to demonstrate home theater systems -- it _ is _ that good .\neven without headphones , sounds from either side of the screen can be clearly heard to _ come _ from that side .\ngiant robot footsteps are deep and booming .\nthe sometimes - understated , sometimes - blaring score is crisp and clear , and always right on the mark , enhancing the moods created by the animated scenery . as far as the subtitles go , i have to say that they 're among the most easily - readable subtitles\ni 've ever seen for _ anything _ .\nlarge enough that they do n't strain the eyes , but small enough not to conceal too much of the screen .\nalthough it does have several action sequences in it , most notably the climactic conclusion , _ patlabor _ is foremost not an action movie .\nalthough it is a superbly - realized film , it relies in large part upon prior familiarity with some of the characters to carry the story , and that could detract from some people 's enjoyment .\nmy .", "output": "P",

thing\nstraight right away : maximum risk is no battleship potemkin ( although it does have some russians in it ! ) , but it 's not too bad , really .\nit 's the new film from ringo lam , the latest hong kong filmmaker to defect to hollywood , and stars that minor league schwartzeneggar from belgium , jean - claude van damme ( who , you will recall , also starred in john woo 's maiden hollywood effort , hard target ) .\nin lam 's film , van damme plays alain moreau , a french cop ( at least his accent makes more sense here than it did in hard target ) who discovers that he was separated shortly after birth from a twin brother who was adopted by russians .\nthese russians defected to the united states and moved into a black neighbourhood in new york ( where , i suppose , they thought they would n't be noticed ) .\nthis brother , mikhail suverov ( played in his few scenes by . . .\nwell , you know ) , becomes deeply involved in the russian mafia and the fbi ( almost the same thing , i guess ) , and is killed in france ( in the movie , things happen so fast that you do n't have too much time to think about how weird this all is ) .\nmoreau does what any good surviving twin brother would do and goes to new york to find out why mikhail was killed , and why everyone in france who knows anything about him is also being killed ( we wonder the same thing ; i still do ) .\nin little odessa , he meets mikhail 's girlfriend , alex ( natasha henstridge , last seen in species ) , who helps him solve the mystery and adds immeasurably to the mise - en - scene ( she has very nice breasts , and we get to seen them briefly in this movie ; it was rated r in the us but is pg here , so they must have seen more of her breasts than we do ) .\nthis film lacks the gloss and high production values of such other action movies as broken arrow , the fugitive , hard target , or anything starring arnold , but that works to its benefit , i think .\nafter all , one thing that 's been missing from woo 's hollywood films is that certain hong kong funkiness that we all know and love ( well , some of us do ) .\nmovies like this should n't be too pretentious , and that is part of the problem with some of these other films : they try to be too \" big \" in terms of special effects and sheer spectacle .\nmaximum risk has its share of car chases and explosions , but they do n't overwhelm the movie or detract our attention from the narrative ( not too much , anyway ) .\nthe emphasis throughout is on the characters and their interactions ( even if , at times , they do n't make a hell of a lot of sense ) .\nin fact , one of the more interesting aspects of the film is a minor character , a rather overeager new york cabbie ( frank van keeken from tv 's \" kids in the hall \" ) , who begins as something of a joke but becomes an important part of the story .\nunfortunately , by the time we have come to really get interested in him , he . . .\nwell , you 'll see .\nthe movie also features some set pieces of the type that we have come to expect from lam and his hong kong compatriots .\none is a fight in a russian sauna , with lots of sweaty , muscular male flesh ( this one will appeal to certain parts of the audience more than others ) , bullets in heads , and vodka .\nanother ,\nmy personal favorite , is a fight in a meat packing house , featuring pig carcasses and a chainsaw .\nand even the predictable car chases are more hong kong than hollywood , as they trash those quaint french cafes , vegetable carts , and , well , french people that , we all know in our hearts , deserve trashing just for being so damn quaint .\nof course , the movie does have its share of silliness .\nfor example , while beating the crap out of an obnoxious russian thug who obviously deserves what he 's getting , alain stops long enough to look at his own reflection in the cracked mirror with which he has been whacking the guy on the head .\nin an unnecessarily dramatic moment , he apparently is shocked at what he sees , at what he has become .\nbut what has he become ?\na tough cop who beats the hell out of a guy who tried to kill him ?\ndoes n't sound too unreasonable to me , considering the genre .\nbut let 's face it , any time van damme tries to be dramatic , he looks silly .\nso maximum risk is a little different from most other action films .\nwhile watching it , i was surprised , and a little disappointed , in the relative lack of pyrotechnics .\nbut watching some of these other action films is sort of like experiencing a sugar rush ; after the initial excitement , there 's not much left .\nalthough it 's short on spectacle , lam 's film leaves a better and more lasting impression , i think .\ni 'm more impressed by it now than i was while watching it , and to me , that 's a good sign .\ngo see maximum risk , but do n't expect a typical hollywood action movie ; expect a sort of funky hong kong - hollywood action movie .\nthe flying inkpot rating

.\nwarner bros .\n, in an attempt to get their own men in black style of movie , had managed to lasso in some big names ( actor will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , the duo behind mib 's success ) in order to get their own fourth of july blockbuster , a contemporary big - screen update to the classic western / sci - fi series the wild wild west starring robert conrad .\nbut somehow , they ran into a problem along the way .\nthey were so busy trying to fill specific roles that they forgot one in general that would 've made all the difference- a story writer .\nwild wild west 's story and script was compiled by six different people , rather than just the one who put the brilliant touches on men in black , ed solomon .\nif warner bros .\nhad gotten him , the movie would 've possibly been five times better than what it is .\nheck , ten times .\nas is , however ,\nthe story and screenplay is a mess , filled with dead laughs , enough racist and sex jokes to make even will cringe as he 's performing them , and a complete lack of chemistry that made the tv show work so well .\nhere 's the story : us army member james west ( will smith\n) teams up with creative genius artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) to take on a ruthless villain by the name of arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , whose lower half was blown off during the civil war , leaving him to roll around in a steam - controlled wheelchair .\nthey catch onto a plot of his involving a superweapon that can basically be considered an 80-foot tarantula ( although it looks bigger than that ) , hellbent on destroying anything in its path .\nas i said , the way the script unfolds is a complete mess .\nbut the acting does n't help either .\nkevin kline is miserable as gordon , failing to display even a smidgeon of care as he did in the 1985 western silverado .\nsmith seems to be having a better time as west , although he 's not nearly as charming as he was in mib .\nbranagh goes excessively over the top as the villain , perhaps to the point where we ca n't even stand to look at him or his strange beard .\nand salma hayek is along for the ride to search for her missing father , but mostly she exists just for sexual attention .\nher acting is barely passable , but what a \" breath of fresh ass \" .\ndirector barry sonnenfeld is n't of great help either .\neven though he shows some good creativity at some points , his overall urgency for directing is lost .\nit 's as if he feels he 's directing a tv movie , a big no - no when you 're helming what 's supposed to be a big - screen hit .\nlast but not least , there are huge gaps of logic that are just plain unacceptable\n.\nat one point , smith defies gravity when first boarding kline 's train .\nhe jumps on the back , gets launched straight up in the air , and somehow manages to land three cars ahead on the train- while it 's still in motion !\nalso , he seems to be strangely comfortable talking about racism in front of a lynch mob , particularly considering the fact that his family was killed by the likes of such folks .\nlast but not least , why is he still making kissing faces when he knows he 's not kissing a woman as he 's looking through a peephole at the enemy ? !\nthe only saving grace for wild wild west come mostly in the form of special effects .\nthe huge mechanical spider is a technical marvel , very authentic looking and considerable to the creativity of the show .\nthere 's also a good sequence involving metal magnet neckbraces and spinning saw blades , but , again , a logic question comes into play regarding their polarity .\ni would say sit back and have a good time with wild wild west , but it really is n't possible .\nif the racist and sex jokes do n't bother you , the performances will .\nif the performances do n't bother you , the story will .\nif the story does n't bother you , the racist and sex jokes will .\nthere 's no end to the vicious circle .\ngo rent men in black instead and

as if he smokes a cigarette between every take .\nwincott makes his villain , korda , as mean as could be , the classic type of villain who would push an old lady down a flight of stairs just for

is no longer on my good list .\ni liked \" metro , \" and i do not think would have worked with any other actor but eddie murphy .\nhis past roles were the great ones but they were also a precursor to the maturing that would later take place , possibly from murphy s growing as a person , now having a family .\n\" metro \" is a no - nonsense movie .\nit works as a buddy movie , which it does not

revolves almost entirely around sex and how can be used for both pain and pleasure even within a small circle of friends .\none of the most important aspects of the film that most be noted and analyzed before the film can really be dissected as a whole is writer / director neil labute 's basic setup and some of the unique methods he employs to tell the story .\nfirstly , and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex , detailed story of lust , betrayal , arrogance , hypocrisy , greed , and just plain stupidity between six different characters ( three men , three women ) , without hardly any supporting characters , ( a few have a line or two ) , mostly extras .\neverything they do will somehow affect another character and ultimately come full - circle back to themselves , whether it be positive or negative .\nbut to just state\nthis is arbitrary , and explaining and criticizing the process is difficult .\nlabute 's ability to tell his story through a few characters is a remarkable feat , but what 's specifically impressive is the fact the characters ' names are never revealed until the end credits roll .\nfor the sake of this review , i will describe the characters and refer to them as their main characteristic .\nanother interesting accomplishment is the fact every scene takes place inside with limited focus .\nwe 're always able to tell where the characters are ( someone 's home , the gym , a restaurant , hotel room , etc . ) , but what the city they live in , what year it is , what the society is like ,\netc .\nis relatively unknown .\nthe film is a complete character study with the tight , intense drama of the theater .\nno one plot dominates the story , which makes the first act a bit tedious for its lack of background .\nwe 're simply dropped in on the characters ' lives and are expected to figure out the rest .\nthe characters are a group of middle - class white people who are all successful at what they do , but they 're only concern right now seems to be their sex lives .\nfirst there 's barry ( eckhart ) and mary ( brenneman ) , a married couple who are going through a dry spell not unlike many other couples in other situations who do n't know what they 're problem is .\nbarry is kind of a dorky businessman who loves his wife , and the sex they have , but does n't have a lot of ambition - he just follows everyone else .\nmary is a writer of some sort , but lacks aggression and emotion like her husband and is the meekness character , but ironically , does n't hesitate to commit adultery just to feel something .\nlabute 's script does a good job in characterizing mary and barry as individuals , but is very light on chemistry and connection between the two .\nobviously , this is the theme , which is enhanced by the actors ' good performances , but at the same time seems just a bit hollow .\nanother couple is jerry ( stiller ) and terri ( keener ) who live together and seem to have been involved with each other for a long time , yet they constantly argue over anything and everything .\ntheir sex life is also fraught with problems and for some reason they continue to do it throughout their infidelitous relationship .\nif only one aspect of the film could use improvement , it would be this area .\nit 's natural for a married couple to become bored with each other , but why would two people who can barely stand each other continue to have sex and live together ?\nwhat did they ever see in the other person to begin with ?\nlabute never really answers , but since the film is more concerned with the payoff than the process , it still makes for good drama , tension , and manip ulation\nso intricate and deceitful\nit 's fascinating .\ntwo other characters act as catalysts , cary ( jason patric ) and cheri ( natassja kinski ) .\ncary is an arrogant , hostile sex - maniac who defines the word \" bastard .\n\"\nsomehow he is able to bend women to his will , either through charm or just attitude , into getting his way .\nhe 's the kind of guy everyone should stay away from as we realize he 's secretly perverted , but somehow barry finds comfort in his company , although jerry is always nervous around him .\npatric gives an outstanding performance , so much so that we want to know more about him despite how intimidating and unlikable he is .\ncheri is a character labute uses as a catalyst to see how the other characters react to her .\nshe works in an art museum and at some point throughout the film , each character will engage her in almost the exact same conversation and her reaction is always different , from becoming involved in a relationship with one , to brushing it off as small talk with another , to being outright appalled by yet another .\nshe 's a sweet woman , perhaps the most normal of any of the characters , and although her symbolism is obvious , her role as the outsider is the most relatable .\ni will not reveal who cheats on who and how each character is specifically affected by the others ' action , as that 's the hook of the film .\nthe first two acts begin to set up the characters and each 's scenarios , but it 's often difficult to tell what they will do about it and with whom .\nthe result is sometimes surprising , other times predictable , but the actual course of actions is always fascinating . for a while everyone has their fun , but ultimately each character 's guilt , attitude , or ignorance will disserve them .\none of the most important things to note is how realistic the story is supposed to be .\nsince the characters only interact with each other there is n't much pop culture references , as almost everything has a deeper philosophy behind it .\nare we to assume that these people are , as the title states , our friends and neighbors ?\ni do n't know of anyone going through the same situations as these people .\noften times the film is not unlike a network melodrama , other times

about women 's world ? not the soap operas and the \" chick flicks \" that are meant to satisfy women , but the real stories that touch on the essence of life like hurlyburly does for men .\nhurlyburly is based on a stage play and that is evident from the moment the film starts .\nit 's very talkative , intelligent and static .\nwhile this can make the film drag a bit , and people sometimes sound like they 're quoting textbooks , mostly this is a good thing .\nnot all films have to be filled with special effects and sweeping panoramas .\nnot all films have to underestimate the

jurassic park ( 1993 ) , his films have been entertaining .\nhowever , he seems to taken a wrong turn somewhere with sphere .\nthis $ 100 million mess by good director barry levison ( disclosure ) is dull , long winded , and a huge disappointment .\nconsidering the huge budget , the all star cast , and a story by crichton\n, sphere is majorly disappointing .\nthe film opens with norman goodman ( hoffman ) , a psychologist who thinks he is visiting an airplane crash to console the survivors .\nhowever , when he arrives , he his told by supervisor barnes\n( peter coyote ) that he is actually investigating an spacecraft .\nalong with goodman is mathematician harry adams ( jackson ) , biologist beth halperin ( stone ) and ted fielding ( liev schrieber . )\nthey investigate the spaceship , find a massive sphere inside , meet an alien intelligence called jerry , and basically weird crap happens .\nunfortunately , something went wrong along the way with sphere .\nthe film starts off entertaining enough , but throughout this very long movie , it just gets sillier and sillier .\nthe film jaunts along from scene to scene , never fully explaining what is going on .\nthe actors and directing do n't help , either .\nhoffman is on autopilot ( and almost seems embarrassed ) throughout the movie , churning out dull lines , and probably wondering what the hell he is doing in this movie .\nstone is useless , displaying no emotion , and fails to convince the audience that she has any feelings for hoffman .\nthe only person who seems to be having fun in this movie is jackson , who 's funny as the mathematician who slowly goes crazy and entering the sphere .\nbut he 's hardly in it , and by the end of the film he is just as dull as hoffman and stone .\nthe same goes for peter coyote , who hams it up as the officer , but is then killed off halfway through .\nthe director , barry levinson , who directed the better crichton adaptation disclosure ( 1994 ) messes up with the drama and the action .\nthe drama scenes are , quite frankly , boring , and the action scenes suffer from overkill , with levison throwing the camera all over the place ( much like the godawful speed 2 , 1997 )\nthe writing does n't help much , either .\nalthough crichton is great with plots , he 's terrible with dialogue , and practically every line in sphere is a dud .\nthe speech is too simple\n, i was hoping it would be a bit more intelligent .\npractically every line is just stating the obvious .\nnone of it is smart .\nalso , where the hell did the budget go ?\nthe sphere itself is impressive , and there 's a few nice special effect shots , but\nwhere the $ 100 million went is anyone 's guess .\nthere 's a giant squid attack in the picture , but not once does the audience see the squid , even though the film has a massive budget .\ni assume the picture was trying to build up tension by not showing the squid , and if handled correctly it probably would .\nbut the whole scene is done badly , and i was just hoping we could see the stupid squid .\nfinally , the film has no idea what genre to be .\nlevison ca n't handle his own plot .\nit leaps from hokey sci - fi , to horror , and finally the shining / event horizon psychological thriller .\nand , of course , the film is very much like the abyss ( 1988 ) , although in it 's defense , crichton did write sphere before the abyss was released ( and is far superior to this rubbish . )\nit 's not all that bad though .\nthe plot is all right , there 's a few jump scenes ( although nothing very scary ) and there 's the occasionally interesting bit .\nbut overall\n, sphere is a big waste of some fine talent , a lot of money , and a potentially good movie .\nnot really worth seeing .\noverall rating= review by

and several of the \" big summer releases \" were dead in the water .\nthank god this film got delayed until december .\nit 's my christmas present .\ntitanic is in the tradition of the old hollywood epics of years - gone - by , and\nit is truly a stunning film .\nwhile watching this picture you are completely mesmerized , never taking your eyes off the screen , nor checking your watch to see how much longer it 's gon na last , despite its 3 hour plus running time .\nas a friend of mine , who 's a true titanic - buff , said \" if someone does n't like this film , it 's because they did n't want to . \" truer words are hard to come by .\nof course , it does n't hurt that this film comes from one of my favorite directors , james cameron , who is unarguably the greatest action director of all time .\nif you wish to argue that point with me , look at his list of credits : the terminator , aliens , the abyss , terminator 2 , true lies , etc .\nstill care to disagree ?\nnot only has cameron helmed the directorial duties of this film , he also wrote , produced , and edited it . and to show his true faith for the project , he renenged all directing fees and percentage points to ease the budget costs .\nit 's obvious he truly loves titanic\n.\nthe film opens with footage , both real and fake , of an underwater excursion by special submarines to the bottom of the atlantic , where a team of explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing for a diamond called the \" heart of the ocean \" , which , according to bill paxton 's character , would be worth more than the hope diamond today .\ntheir search turns up , dissapointly , no diamond , but instead a drawing of a young woman wearing the diamond .\nthis picture is broadcast on cnn and is seen by a 101 year old woman named rose , who claims to be the girl in the picture .\nshe is flown out to sea to meet bill paxton and to tell them about the diamond .\nalmost all of the rest of the movie is her narration of the past .\nrose 's narration shows us how she was an unhappy young girl , engaged to a rich man named cal hockley ( billy zane ) that she did n't want to marry .\nher mother is pushy and obnoxious , and cal hockley is arrogant .\nthey are boarding the titanic , which is sailing to america , and this is where she is to marry cal .\nmeanwhile , a young man named jack dawson ( leonardo dicaprio ) and his italian friend ( danny nucci ) win two 3rd class tickets aboard the titanic in a poker game .\nthey are overjoyed , and rush aboard just as the boat is leaving .\nfor them , this is their ticket to america , to a better life .\nfor rose , she is sailing to her doom .\nthe first hour and a half or so of titanic tells the story of how rose dewitt ( kate winslet ) and jack dawson fall in love .\nit 's the classic wrong - side - of - the - tracks story , and does sometimes resort to a few cliches .\nbut as i said above , the love portion is n't sappy and does n't \" weigh the film down \" , as some critics have said .\nit 's sweet , and it did n't make me restless at all , despite the fact that i usually hate love stories .\nof course , it might help that cameron introduces some pretty interesting characters to help keep our eyes glued to the screen\n.\nmost of these people actually were passengers on the titanic back in 1912 , including the enigmatic molly brown ( played by the talented kathy bates ) , the captain of titanic ( bernard hill ) , and so on .\nall of these characters add an extra depth to the film , and make it that easier to watch .\nof course , things really start to get going\nafter the hour and a half mark , where the titanic strikes the iceberg and begins a slow sink to the bottom .\nthe sinking is depicted realisticly , and the effects are truly amazing .\nit is not told in a heroic fashion sense either , as people are portrayed as panicking , pushing others aside to get on the limited lifeboats , and drowning and dying horrible deaths .\nthe best part of the movie , in my opinion , comes at the very end , when we flash back to the future .\nthe crew , who at first had been skeptical of rose 's story , now are totally aborbed by her .\nrose goes out onto the ship 's ledge , and we then learn a secret about her that catches us off guard .\nwe then see a dream of rose 's , in which she returns to the titanic and is dancing with jack dawson .\nmost people i talked with after the movie saw this as only a dream .\nhowever , i think it symbolized more ; i think it meant that rose had died , and is going to a sort of heaven , which would be the happiest part of her life :\nher and her one true love , jack .\nif anyone has seen the movie and would like to voice an opinion about this , e - mail me at venom8@hotmail .\ncom

of hamlet with ethan hawke as the heir apparent of the denmark corp .\nhere the setting was the corporate world of new york .\nnow comes o , a faithful retelling of one of the most tragic of

standout player .\njulia stiles , featured in 10 things i hate about you as well as performing ophelia in hawke 's hamlet , plays desi brable , odin 's girlfriend , whose father also happens to be

kaaya , is very grim .\nan air of tragedy weighs it down from the opening scene to the closing credits .\nand that is how it should be .\nof all of shakespeare 's tragedies , othello is the most harrowing , not because of any body count , but because of the psychological havoc wreaked by iago , whose motivation in the sheer pleasure of his treachery .\nkaaya 's profane - filled script - after

shoot , rebound - but is constantly in the shadow of odin .\nplus his father , the team 's coach - played with a ferocious intensity by martin sheen - showers more love and concern on his star player than on his own flesh and blood .\nthe script follows the familiar lines of the classic .\nhugo begins dropping hints to odin concerning desi 's fidelity , eroding the star 's confidence in those he considers closest to him , affecting both his relationships and his game .\nit all ends in blood , of course , which is why the movie was originally shelved .\nthe performances in o vary .\nphifer is at first cocky and self - assured , emotions he handles with ease .\nhe also does quite well displaying odin 's darker side ; his defensive sensitivity about being the only black at the institution ,

does contain a few missteps : a subplot involving hugo 's theft of the school mascot is left hanging .\nalso desi 's actions concerning michael ( andrew keegan ) , odin 's former teammate and best friend who was kicked off the team because of one of hugo 's machinations , is puzzling .\nwhy she would continually be seen with michael - however innocent the circumstances - when she knows her man
