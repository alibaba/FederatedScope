They infect humans as well as numerous mammalian species. Both viruses use ephrin-B2 and -B3 as cell entry receptors, and following initial entry into an organism, they are capable of rapid spread throughout the host. We have previously reported that Nipah virus can use another attachment receptor, different from its entry receptors, to bind to nonpermissive circulating leukocytes, thereby promoting viral dissemination within the host. Here, this attachment molecule was identified as heparan sulfate for both Nipah virus and Hendra virus. Cells devoid of heparan sulfate were not able to mediate henipavirus trans-infection and showed reduced permissivity to infection. Virus pseudotyped with Nipah virus glycoproteins bound heparan sulfate and heparin but no other glycosaminoglycans in a surface plasmon resonance assay. Furthermore, heparin was able to inhibit the interaction of the viruses with the heparan sulfate and to block cell-mediated trans-infection of henipaviruses. Moreover, heparin was shown to bind to ephrin-B3 and to restrain infection of permissive cells in vitro. Consequently, treatment with heparin devoid of anticoagulant activity improved the survival of Nipah virus-infected hamsters. Altogether, these results reveal heparan sulfate as a new attachment receptor for henipaviruses and as a potential therapeutic target for the development of novel approaches against these highly lethal infections. and open novel perspectives for the development of heparan sulfate-targeting therapeutic approaches for these emerging infections. \n Title: Heparan Sulfate-Dependent Enhancement of Henipavirus Infection", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

It is postulated that these organisms may contribute to inflammation in the airways possibly by activating inflammatory mechanisms in the respiratory tract. The macrolide class of antibiotics may have a part to play in the management of asthma by exerting anti-inflammatory effects on the chronically inflamed airways in addition to their anti-infective action.

While numerous studies have focused on the mentioned highly human-pathogenic bat viruses in tropical regions, little is known on similar human-pathogenic viruses that may be present in European bats. Although novel viruses are being detected, their zoonotic potential remains unclear unless further studies are conducted. At present, it is assumed that the risk posed by bats to the general public is rather low. In this review, selected viruses detected and isolated in Europe are discussed from our point of view in regard to their human-pathogenic potential. All European bat species and their roosts are legally protected and some European species are even endangered. Nevertheless, the increasing public fear of bats and their viruses is an obstacle to their protection.

A decade later, One Health advocates face increasing pressure to translate the approach from theory into action. Methodology/Principal Findings: A qualitative case study methodology was used to examine the emerging relationships between international One Health dialogue and its practical implementation in the African health policy context. A series of Key Informant Interviews (n = 32) with policy makers, government officials and academics in Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda are presented as three separate case studies. Each case examines a significant aspect of One Health operationalisation, framed around the control of both emerging and Neglected Zoonotic Diseases including HPAI, Human African Trypanosomiasis and rabies. The research found that while there is general enthusiasm and a strong affirmative argument for adoption of One Health approaches in Africa, identifying alternative contexts away from a narrow focus on pandemics will help broaden its appeal, particularly for national or regionally significant endemic and neglected diseases not usually addressed under a ''global'' remit. Conclusions/Significance: There is no 'one size fits all' approach to achieving the intersectoral collaboration, significant resource mobilisation and political co-operation required to realise a One Health approach. Individual country requirements cannot be underestimated, dismissed or prescribed in a top down manner. This article contributes to the growing discussion regarding not whether One Health should be operationalised, but how this may be achieved. \n Title: One Health: Past Successes and Future Challenges in Three African Contexts", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

However, little is known about the disease burden and the molecular epidemiology of HAdV. Objectives: To retrospectively perform a molecular characterization of HAdV positive samples received at Statens Serum Institut during the period 2011-2016 and to compare this with demographic information, geographic location, sample collection date and type and co-infection with other viral pathogens. Study design: 152 HAdV positive samples were genotyped by Sanger sequencing of a fragment of the hexon gene using published primers along with a newly developed primer set for enhanced genotyping of HAdV D. Phylogenetic analysis was used for genotyping and genotypes were compared with epidemiological information. In addition, HAdV burden and co-infection was evaluated for samples tested in laboratory analysis packages. Results: Six out of seven HAdV species were identified and represented by 13 types. Young children (< 5 years old) were more likely to be positive for HAdV and co-infections with other gastrointestinal or respiratory viruses were common. Possible outbreaks of ocular infections due to HAdV D could not be confirmed. Conclusion: A diverse set of HAdV species were circulating in Denmark in the study period and although possible transmission clusters were identified, this could not be verified with current genotyping methods Young children were commonly affected by HAdV infection and co-infections with other viral pathogens were frequent suggesting a possible underestimation of the real HAdV burden. \n Title: Molecular epidemiology of human adenovirus infections in Denmark, 2011-2016", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

The catalytic Cys and His residues and cleavage sites for each of the SHFV PLP1s were predicted and their functionality was tested in in vitro transcription/translation reactions done with wildtype or mutant polyprotein constructs. Mass spectrometry analyses of selected autoproteolytic products confirmed cleavage site locations. The catalytic Cys of PLP1\u2423 is unusual in being adjacent to an Ala instead of a Typ. PLP1\u2425 cleaves at both downstream and upstream sites. Intermediate precursor and alternative cleavage products were detected in the in vitro transcription/translation reactions but only the three mature nsp1 proteins were detected in SHFV-infected MA104 cell lysates with SHFV nsp1 protein-specific antibodies. The duplicated sets of SHFV minor structural proteins were predicted to be functionally redundant. A stable, full-length, infectious SHFV-LVR cDNA clone was constructed and a set of mutant infectious clones was generated each with the start codon of one of the minor structural proteins mutated. All eight of the minor structural proteins were found to be required for production of infectious extracellular virus. SHFV causes a fatal hemorrhagic fever in macaques but asymptomatic, persistent infections in natural hosts such as baboons. SHFV infections were compared in macrophages and myeloid dendritic cells from baboons and macaques. Virus yields were higher from macaque cells than from baboon cells. Macrophage cultures from the two types of animals differed dramatically in the percentage of cells infected. In contrast, similar percentages of myeloid dendritic cells were infected but virus replication was efficient in the macaque cells but inefficient in the baboon cells. SHFV infection induced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1\u2424, IL-6, IL-12/23(p40), TNF-\u2423 and MIP-1\u2423, in macaque cells but not baboon cells.

Disease symptoms associated with EAV and PRRSV infections include fever, respiratory disease, tissue necrosis and spontaneous abortions while LDV typically causes an asymptomatic, persistent infection (Snijder and Spaan, 2006) . The majority of research on arteriviruses has focused on EAV and PRRSV due to the significant agricultural impact of the diseases they cause.

SARS is a threat which is similar to MERS virus, but the comorbidity is the key aspect to underline their different impacts. One UK doctor says \"I'd rather have HIV than diabetes\" as life expectancy among diabetes patients is lower than that of HIV. However, HIV has a comorbidity impact on the diabetes. Results: We present a quantitative framework to compare and explore comorbidity between diseases. By using neighbourhood based benchmark and topological methods, we have built comorbidity relationships network based on the OMIM and our identified significant genes. Then based on the gene expression, PPI and signalling pathways data, we investigate the comorbidity association of these 2 infective pathologies with other 7 diseases (heart failure, kidney disorder, breast cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, bone diseases, Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes). Phenotypic association is measured by calculating both the Relative Risk as the quantified measures of comorbidity tendency of two disease pairs and the \u03c6-correlation to measure the robustness of the comorbidity associations. The differential gene expression profiling strongly suggests that the response of SARS affected patients seems to be mainly an innate inflammatory response and statistically dysregulates a large number of genes, pathways and PPIs subnetworks in different pathologies such as chronic heart failure (21 genes), breast cancer (16 genes) and bone diseases (11 genes). HIV-1 induces comorbidities relationship with many other diseases, particularly strong correlation with the neurological, cancer, metabolic and immunological diseases. Similar comorbidities risk is observed from the clinical information. Moreover, SARS and HIV infections dysregulate 4 genes (ANXA3, GNS, HIST1H1C, RASA3) and 3 genes (HBA1, TFRC, GHITM) respectively that affect the ageing process. It is notable that HIV and SARS similarly dysregulated 11 genes and 3 pathways. Only 4 significantly dysregulated genes are common between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, including NFKBIA that is a key regulator of immune responsiveness implicated in susceptibility to infectious and inflammatory diseases.

This review examines the evidence regarding toilet plume bioaerosol generation and infectious disease transmission. Methods-The peer-reviewed scientific literature was searched to identify articles related to aerosol production during toilet flushing, as well as epidemiologic studies examining the potential role of toilets in infectious disease outbreaks. Results-The studies demonstrate that potentially infectious aerosols may be produced in substantial quantities during flushing. Aerosolization can continue through multiple flushes to expose subsequent toilet users. Some of the aerosols desiccate to become droplet nuclei and remain adrift in the air currents. However, no studies have yet clearly demonstrated or refuted toilet plume-related disease transmission, and the significance of the risk remains largely uncharacterized.

To date, eleven RNAs and five viral proteins of PCV2 have been detected. Here, we identified a novel viral gene within the PCV2 genome, termed ORF5, that exists at both the transcriptional and translational level during productive infection of PCV2 in porcine alveolar macrophages 3D4/2 (PAMs). Northern blot analysis was used to demonstrate that the ORF5 gene measures 180 bp in length and overlaps completely with ORF1 when read in the same direction. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to show that the ORF5 protein is not essential for PCV2 replication. To investigate the biological functions of the novel protein, we constructed a recombinant eukaryotic expression plasmid capable of expressing PCV2 ORF5. The results show that the GFP-tagged PCV2 ORF5 protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is degraded via the proteasome, inhibits PAM growth and prolongs the S-phase of the cell cycle. Further studies show that the GFP-tagged PCV2 ORF5 protein induces ER stress and activates NF-\u03baB, which was further confirmed by a significant upregulation in IL-6, IL-8 and COX-2 expression. In addition, five cellular proteins (GPNMB, CYP1A1, YWHAB, ZNF511 and SRSF3) were found to interact with ORF5 via yeast two-hybrid assay. These findings provide novel information on the identification and functional analysis of the PCV2 ORF5 protein and are likely to be of benefit in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of PCV2 pathogenicity. However, additional experiments are needed to validate the expression and function of the ORF5 protein during PCV2 infection in vitro before any definitive conclusion can be drawn. piglets and is clinically characterized by fever, unthriftiness, respiratory distress, enlarged lymph nodes, and occasional jaundice and diarrhea [7] [8] . Many other conditions, including congenital tremors (CT), porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS), porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC), reproduction disorders and fetal myocarditis, are also closely related to PCV2 infection [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . PCV2 infection leads to the development of microscopic lesions mainly dominated by lymphoid depletion and histiocytic infiltration in lymphoid tissues [9, [15] [16] [17] . Mortality rates may vary from 15 to 20% and can be significantly higher in the presence of co-infection with either porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) or mycoplasma hyopneumoniae [7] [8] 18] . PCV2 infection has thus far caused huge economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. The PCV2 genome is a single-stranded, ambisense, closed circular DNA containing between 1,766 and 1,768 nucleotides [19] [20] . Although the nucleotide homology within individual isolates of either PCV1 or PCV2 is over 90%, the homology between PCV1 and PCV2 as serotypes is only 68% to 76% [19, 21] . This diversity may be responsible for the differences in pathogenicity or virulence observed for these serotypes. The virus was predicted to possess 11 overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) [19], of which four have been characterized in detail in replicating PCV2. On the viral strand, there is the ORF1 (nucleotides 51-995) gene, which encodes the Rep and Rep' proteins essential for PCV2 replication [22]. On the complementary strand, there are the ORF2 (nucleotides 1735-1034), ORF3 (nucleotides 671-357) and ORF4 (nucleotides 565-386) genes, which encode the capsid protein [23], apoptotic protein [21] and controversial anti-apoptotic protein, respectively [24-25]. Previous transcriptional analysis conducted during productive PCV2 infection of porcine kidney cells measured nine unique PCV2-specific RNA transcripts (designated-CR, Rep, Rep 0 , Rep3a, Rep3b, Rep3c, NS515, NS672, and NS0) [26]; however, only CR, Rep and Rep 0 transcripts were proven capable of translation into functional proteins [22, [26] [27] . In contrast, ORF3 and ORF4 transcripts, which are not included in the above nine RNAs, were subsequently confirmed to play important roles in the pathogenesis of PCV2; ORF3-deficient PCV2 is attenuated in its natural host [28] , and ORF4-deficient PCV2 induces a higher viral load and more severe microscopic lesions in the spleen during early stages of infection in mice [24] . Collectively, these research findings indicate that PCV2 pathogenesis is both complicated and multigenic and that the individual viral proteins encoded by ORF2, ORF3 or ORF4 are insufficient in determining pathogenicity. Previous computational analysis has revealed that the PCV2 genome contains at least seven ORFs with the potential to encode proteins > 5 kDa [29] ; to date, four have been identified. However, it has not yet been determined whether the three additional predicted proteins exist or whether there are still other viral proteins encoded by PCV2 that control its pathogenicity. Sequence alignment analysis of PCV2 isolates from varying geographic regions suggested that the putative ORF5 gene (proposed to exist by Hamel et al) might not encode a functional protein, as translation of the protein was found to terminate after only seven amino acids in some Chinese PCV2 strains [19, 30] . However, several groups have aligned the genomic sequences of various PCV2 isolates and found a region of extremely high identity (over 95%) at the amino acid level, suggesting that PCV2 encodes a novel protein, although different names for this possible protein have been used in the literature (Gen Bank accession no. O92288, Q77GS3, Q77S04, etc). This new putative viral gene (designated ORF5 in this study), which is entirely different from that predicted by Hamel et al in 1998 [19], completely overlaps the ORF1 gene and is read in the same direction. The ORF5 gene is approximately 180 bp (spanning nucleotides 553-732) and encodes a polypeptide that is predicted to be of 6.5 kDa in molecular weight, whereas the corresponding region of PCV1 does not appear to produce a peptide. As PCV1 isolates are naturally nonpathogenic [31] [32] and PCV2 isolates are pathogenic, this putative polypeptide may be important for the pathogenesis of PCV2.

The scientific community played a leading role during the outbreak-potentially, the largest of its kind-as many of the questions surrounding ebolaviruses have only been interrogated in the laboratory. Scientists provided an invaluable resource for clinicians, public health officials, policy makers, and the lay public in understanding the progress of Ebola virus disease and the continuing outbreak. Not all of the scientific communication, however, was accurate or effective. There were multiple instances of published articles during the height of the outbreak containing potentially misleading scientific language that spurred media overreaction and potentially jeopardized preparedness and policy decisions at critical points. Here, we use articles declaring the potential for airborne transmission of Ebola virus as a case study in the inaccurate reporting of basic science, and we provide recommendations for improving the communication about unknown aspects of disease during public health crises. Basic scientific research is now considered an integral component of the fight against emerging infectious diseases like Ebola virus. The recent Ebola outbreak, however, demonstrates how the ineffective communication of basic science can stoke public panic more than it provides helpful tools to responders; basic science trades in probabilities and uncertainty, while public communication tends to favor more categorical claims. Here, we discuss the ethics of communicating scientific results, using, as a case study, the recent controversy over whether basic life sciences research demonstrates that Ebola could become transmissible via airborne respiratory droplet nuclei-popularly known as a virus becoming \"airborne.\" We show how the science does not demonstrate this possibility, despite claims made in the popular and scientific press. We then recommend that uncertain scientific results in the context of public health crises ought to be communicated with humility, an emphasis on what is unknown, and a clear outline of the kinds of evidence that would give proof to controversial claims. \n Title: Effectively Communicating the Uncertainties Surrounding Ebola Virus Transmission", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

It is important to 1) identify the unique ethical challenges facing physicians who feel an obligation to care for victims of such disasters and 2) develop a national consensus on ethical guidelines as a resource for ethical decision making in medical disaster relief. STUDY DESIGN: A survey of pertinent literature was performed to assess experience and opinions on the condition of medical care in terrorist attacks and natural disasters, the ethical challenges of disaster medical care, and the professional responsibilities and responsiveness in disasters. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to develop a national consensus on the ethical guidelines for physicians who care for patients, victims, and casualties of disasters, and to formulate a virtuebased, yet practical, ethical approach to medical care under such extreme conditions. An educational curriculum for medical students, residents, and practicing physicians is required to best prepare all physicians who might be called upon, in the future, to triage patients, allocate resources, and make difficult decisions about treatment priorities and comfort care. It is not appropriate to address these questions at the time of the disaster, but rather in advance, as part of the ethics education of the medical profession. Important issues for resolution include inpatient and casualty triage and prioritization, medical liability, altered standards of care, justice and equity, informed consent and patient autonomy, expanding scope of practice in disaster medicine, and the moral and ethical responsibilities of physicians to care for disaster victims. \n Title: Making difficult ethical decisions in patient care during natural disasters and other mass casualty events", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

There is no vaccine for HRSV and anti-viral therapeutics are not broadly applicable. To investigate the effect of HRSV biology in children, nasopharyngeal aspirates were taken from children with different viral loads and a combined high throughput RNAseq and label free quantitative proteomics approach was used to characterize the nucleic acid and proteins in these samples. HRSV proteins were identified in the nasopharyngeal aspirates from infected children, and their abundance correlated with viral load (Ct value), confirming HRSV infection. Analysis of the HRSV genome indicated that the children were infected with sub-group A virus and that minor variants in nucleotide frequency occurred in discrete clusters along the HRSV genome, and within a patient clustered distinctly within the glycoprotein gene. Data from the samples were binned into four groups; no-HRSV infection (control), high viral load (Ct < 20), medium viral load (Ct = 20-25), and low viral load (Ct > 25). Cellular proteins associated with the anti-viral response (e.g., ISG15) were identified in the nasopharyngeal aspirates and their abundance was correlated with viral load. These combined approaches have not been used before to study HRSV biology in vivo and can be readily applied to the study the variation of virus host interactions.

Injection of chicken embryo with the GLTSCR2-specific shRNA-1370 simultaneously or 24 h prior to infection with Newcastle disease virus (NDV) substantially reduces viral replication in chicken embryo fibroblasts. Injection of shRNA-1370 into chicken embryo also reduces the replication of avian influenza virus (AIV).

However, due to the low abundance of viral nucleic acids (NAs) in relation to host, viral identification using direct NGS technologies often lacks sufficient sensitivity. Here, we describe an approach based on two complementary enrichment strategies that significantly improves the sensitivity of NGS-based virus identification. To start, we developed two sets of DNA probes to enrich virus NAs associated with respiratory diseases. The first set of probes spans the genomes, allowing for identification of known viruses and full genome sequencing, while the second set targets regions conserved among viral families or genera, providing the ability to detect both known and potentially novel members of those virus groups. Efficiency of enrichment was assessed by NGS testing reference virus and clinical samples with known infection. We show significant improvement in viral identification using enriched NGS compared to unenriched NGS. Without enrichment, we observed an average of 0.3% targeted viral reads per sample. However, after enrichment, 50%-99% of the reads per sample were the targeted viral reads for both the reference isolates and clinical specimens using both probe sets. Importantly, dramatic improvements on genome coverage were also observed following virus-specific probe enrichment. The methods described here provide improved sensitivity for virus identification by NGS, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of disease etiology. \n Title: Comprehensive viral enrichment enables sensitive respiratory virus genomic identification and analysis by next generation sequencing", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Endothelial cells may act as a target of the virus and be involved in disease pathogenesis. Therefore, the identification of host cell components involved in DENV replication would provide useful information for better understanding DENV infection. In this study, a significantly decreased level of miR-223 was found in DENV2-infected EAhy926 cells, a human endothelial-like cell line, whereas miR-223 overexpression inhibited DENV2 replication. Furthermore, we identified that miR-223 directly targeted the 3 0 untranslated region (3 0 UTR) of the messenger RNA (mRNA) for microtubule-destabilizing protein stathmin 1 (STMN1), thereby reducing its mRNA and protein levels. The depletion of miR-223 or overexpression of STMN1 enhanced DENV2 replication, whereas the opposite (increased miR-223 or decreased STMN1) suppressed DENV2 replication, indicating that miR-223 downregulates STMN1 expression by targeting the 3 0 UTR of the STMN1 gene to inhibit DENV2 replication. Finally, we demonstrated that two transcription factors, C/EBPa and E2F1, are involved in the regulation of miR-223 levels after DENV2 infection in EAhy926 cells.

In the case of zoonoses emerging from livestock, one of the most significant changes that has taken place since the mid twentieth century is what has been termed the \"livestock revolution\", whereby the stock of food animals, their productivity and their trade has increased rapidly to feed rising and increasingly wealthy and urbanized populations. Further increases are projected in the future in low and middle-income countries. Using avian influenza as an example, we discuss how the emergence of avian influenza H5N1 and H7N9 in China was linked to rapid intensification of the poultry sector taking place in landscapes rich in wetland agriculture and wild waterfowls habitats, providing an extensive interface with the wild reservoir of avian influenza viruses. Trade networks and live-poultry markets further exacerbated the spread and persistence of avian influenza as well as human exposure. However, as the history of emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) demonstrates in high-income countries such as the USA, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom or the Netherlands, this is by no way specific to low and middle-income countries. Many HPAI emergence events took place in countries with generally good biosecurity standards, and the majority of these in regions hosting intensive poultry production systems. Emerging zoonoses are only one of a number of externalities of intensive livestock production systems, alongside antimicrobial consumption, disruption of nutrient cycles and greenhouse gases emissions, with direct or indirect impacts on human health. In parallel, livestock production is essential to nutrition and livelihoods in many low-income countries. Deindustrialization of the most intensive production systems in high-income countries and sustainable intensifications in low-income countries may converge to a situation where the nutritional and livelihood benefits of livestock production would be less overshadowed by its negative impacts on human an ecosystem health. \n Title: Intensifying poultry production systems and the emergence of avian influenza in China: a 'One Health/Ecohealth' epitome", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

The nature and severity of disease can vary between clinical cases. Genetic determinants of virulence are likely to contribute to differences in the in vivo phenotype of FHV-1 isolates, but to date there have been limited studies investigating FHV-1 genetic diversity. This study used next generation sequencing to compare the genomes of contemporary Australian clinical isolates of FHV-1, vaccine isolates and historical clinical isolates, including isolates that predated the introduction of live attenuated vaccines into Australia. Analysis of the genome sequences aimed to assess the level of genetic diversity, identify potential genetic markers that could influence the in vivo phenotype of the isolates and examine the sequences for evidence of recombination. Results: The full genome sequences of 26 isolates of FHV-1 were determined, including two vaccine isolates and 24 clinical isolates that were collected over a period of approximately 40 years. Analysis of the genome sequences revealed a remarkably low level of diversity (0.0-0.01 %) between the isolates. No potential genetic determinants of virulence were identified, but unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the UL28 and UL44 genes were detected in the vaccine isolates that were not present in the clinical isolates. No evidence of FHV-1 recombination was detected using multiple methods of recombination detection, even though many of the isolates originated from cats housed in a shelter environment where high infective pressures were likely to exist. Evidence of displacement of dominant FHV-1 isolates with other (genetically distinct) FHV-1 isolates over time was observed amongst the isolates obtained from the shelter-housed animals. The results show that FHV-1 genomes are highly conserved. The lack of recombination detected in the FHV-1 genomes suggests that the risk of attenuated vaccines recombining to generate virulent field viruses is lower than has been suggested for some other herpesviruses. The SNPs detected only in the vaccine isolates offer the potential to develop PCR-based methods of differentiating vaccine and clinical isolates of FHV-1 in order to facilitate future epidemiological studies. \n Title: Low genetic diversity among historical and contemporary clinical isolates of felid herpesvirus 1", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

There were no significant differences observed among these BCoVs in direct immunofluorescence tests. However, antigenic differences were observed between BCoVs in the neutralization tests, although there was no clear indication of a distinct serotype.

This includes enhancing viral macromolecular synthesis and assembly, as well as preventing antiviral responses, including intrinsic, innate, and adaptive immunity. There are numerous mechanisms by which viruses mediate their effects on the host cell, and this includes targeting various cellular post-translational modification systems, including sumoylation. The wide-ranging impact of sumoylation on cellular processes such as transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, stress response, and cell cycle control makes it an attractive target for viral dysregulation. To date, proteins from both RNA and DNA virus families have been shown to be modified by SUMO conjugation, and this modification appears critical for viral protein function. More interestingly, members of the several viral families have been shown to modulate sumoylation, including papillomaviruses, adenoviruses, herpesviruses, orthomyxoviruses, filoviruses, and picornaviruses.

These dynamics will depend on seasonality, the duration of immunity, and the strength of cross-immunity to/from the other human coronaviruses. Using data from the United States, we measured how these factors affect transmission of human betacoronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. We then built a mathematical model to simulate transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the year 2025. We project that recurrent wintertime outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 will probably occur after an initial pandemic wave. We summarize the full range of plausible transmission scenarios and identify key data still needed to distinguish between them, most importantly longitudinal serological studies to determine the duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Main text. The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has caused nearly 80,000 detected cases of COVID-19 illness and claimed over 2,500 lives as of 24 Feb 2020 (1). With sustained transmission reported in China, Japan, Iran, Italy, and South Korea (1), the outbreak is on the verge of becoming a pandemic. The required intensity, duration, and urgency of public health responses will depend on how the initial pandemic wave unfolds and on the subsequent transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. One possibility is that SARS-CoV-2 will follow its closest genetic relative, SARS-CoV, and be eradicated by intensive public health measures after causing a brief but intense epidemic (2). Increasingly, public health authorities consider this scenario unlikely (3). Alternatively, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 could resemble that of pandemic influenza by circulating seasonally after causing an initial global wave of infection (4). Such a scenario could reflect the previous emergence of known human coronaviruses from zoonotic origins e.g. human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43 (5). This paper identifies viral, environmental, and immunologic factors which in combination will determine which scenarios in fact play out, and identifies key data needed to distinguish between them. The transmission dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic will depend on factors including the degree of seasonal variation in transmission strength, the duration of immunity, and the degree of cross-immunity between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the betacoronavirus genus, which includes the SARS coronavirus, MERS coronavirus, and two other human coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. The SARS and MERS coronaviruses cause severe illness with case fatality rates of 9 and 36% respectively, but the transmission of both has remained limited (6). HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 infections may be asymptomatic or associated with mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illness; these HCoVs are considered the second most common cause of the common cold (6). While investigations into the spectrum of illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 are ongoing, recent evidence indicates the majority of cases experience mild illness with more limited occurrence of severe lower respiratory infection (7). Current COVID-19 case fatality rates in China are estimated at 2.9% within Hubei province, and 0.4% outside (8), suggesting lower severity than SARS and MERS but higher severity than HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. In terms of transmission, the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to cause widespread infection is more reflective of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 than of its more clinically severe relatives. HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 cause annual wintertime outbreaks of respiratory illness in temperate regions (9, 10), suggesting that wintertime climate and host behaviors may facilitate transmission, as is true for influenza (11) (12) (13) . Immunity to HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 appears to wane appreciably within one year (14), while SARS infection can induce longer-lasting immunity (15). The .

At a histopathological level, the disease is identified by the presence of large eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions in multiple tissues. To date, no virus or other pathogen has been definitively characterized or associated with the disease. Using a metagenomic approach to search for candidate etiologic agents in snakes with confirmed IBD, we identified and de novo assembled the complete genomic sequences of two viruses related to arenaviruses, and a third arenavirus-like sequence was discovered by screening an additional set of samples. A continuous boa constrictor cell line was established and used to propagate and isolate one of the viruses in culture. Viral nucleoprotein was localized and concentrated within large cytoplasmic inclusions in infected cells in culture and tissues from diseased snakes. In total, viral RNA was detected in 6/8 confirmed IBD cases and 0/18 controls. These viruses have a typical arenavirus genome organization but are highly divergent, belonging to a lineage separate from that of the Old and New World arenaviruses. Furthermore, these viruses encode envelope glycoproteins that are more similar to those of filoviruses than to those of other arenaviruses. These findings implicate these viruses as candidate etiologic agents of IBD. The presence of arenaviruses outside mammals reveals that these viruses infect an unexpectedly broad range of species and represent a new reservoir of potential human pathogens. The cause of the disease has remained elusive, and no treatment exists. In addition to being important to pet owners, veterinarians, breeders, zoological parks, and aquariums, the study of animal disease is significant since animals are the source of virtually every emerging infectious human disease. We searched for candidate causative agents in snakes diagnosed with IBD and found a group of novel viruses distantly related mainly to arenaviruses but also to filoviruses, both of which can cause fatal hemorrhagic fevers when transmitted from animals to humans. In addition to providing evidence that strongly suggests that these viruses cause snake IBD, this discovery reveals a new and unanticipated domain of virus biology and evolution.

However, the molecular mechanisms controlling rice resistance to RSV infection are largely unknown. Recently, several studies presented a novel model that melatonin (MT) and nitric oxide (NO) participate in the plant-pathogen interaction in a synergetic manner. In this study, there was a difference in MT content between two rice varieties that correlated with one being susceptible and one being resistant to RSV, which suggested that MT is related to RSV resistance. In addition, a test with two NO biosynthesis inhibitors revealed that NO inhibitor were able to increase the disease incidence of RSV. A pharmacological experiment with exogenous MT and NO showed that increased MT and NO in the MT-pretreated plants led to lower disease incidences; however, only NO increased in a NO-releasing reagent [sodium nitroprusside (SNP)] pretreated plants. The expressions level of OsPR1b and OsWRKY 45 were significantly induced by MT and NO. These results suggest that rice resistance to RSV can be improved by increased MT through a NO-dependent pathway. \n Title: Melatonin is responsible for rice resistance to rice stripe virus infection through a nitric oxide-dependent pathway", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

The viruses could be split into several clusters, and recent isolates of TGEV from England, The Netherlands and Belgium showed the greatest differences compared to earlier reference types.

Despite observance of their functionality, the evolutionary dynamics of this gene family are complex and currently unknown. Here, we performed detailed evolutionary analyses to unravel the evolutionary history of the vertebrate IFITM family. A total of 174 IFITM orthologous genes and 112 pseudogenes were identified from 27 vertebrate genome sequences. The vertebrate IFITM family can be divided into immunity-related IFITM (IR-IFITM), IFITM5 and IFITM10 sub-families in phylogeny, implying origins from three different progenitors. In general, vertebrate IFITM genes are located in two loci, one containing the IFITM10 gene, and the other locus containing IFITM5 and various numbers of IR-IFITM genes. Conservation of evolutionary synteny was observed in these IFITM genes. Significant functional divergence was detected among the three IFITM sub-families. No gene duplication or positive selection was found in IFITM5 sub-family, implying the functional conservation of IFITM5 in vertebrate evolution, which is involved in bone formation. No IFITM5 locus was identified in the marmoset genome, suggesting a potential association with the tiny size of this monkey. The IFITM10 sub-family was divided into two groups: aquatic and terrestrial types. Functional divergence was detected between the two groups, and five IFITM10-like genes from frog were dispersed into the two groups. Both gene duplication and positive selection were observed in aquatic vertebrate IFITM10-like genes, indicating that IFITM10 might be associated with the adaptation to aquatic environments. A large number of lineage-and species-specific gene duplications were observed in IR-IFITM sub-family and positive selection was detected in IR-IFITM of primates and rodents. Because primates have experienced a long history of viral infection, such rapid expansion and positive selection suggests that the evolution of primate IR-IFITM genes is associated with broad-spectrum antiviral activity. \n Title: Evolutionary Dynamics of the Interferon-Induced Transmembrane Gene Family in Vertebrates", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

However, outbreaks have more recently also been associated with nephropathogenesis. Topographically interrelated antigenic determinants of the nephropathogenic Gray strain of IBV were characterized using eleven monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Four MAbs (IgG 2a~c) defined epitopes that were both conformation-independent and group specific, reacting with Gray, Arkansas (Ark), and Massachusetts41 (Mass41) strains. Seven MAbs (IgG 1~:) defined conformation-dependent epitopes that could differentiate the Gray from the Ark and Mass strains. The spike protein specificity of the MAbs was determined with the conformation-independent MAbs and one MAb that reacted only in \"non-denaturing\" western blot assays. Competitive binding studies using these MAbs suggested a high degree of functional dependency among the associated epitopes as might be expected with a protein of complex secondary and tertiary structure. At least two regions associated with complete protection of infected embryos were identified that consisted of both conformation-dependent and independent epitopes. However, a \"non-neutralizing\" MAb, which did not protect the embryo from gross lesions, did inhibit virus-induced lesions and replication in the kidneys.

Because of limited prophylaxis and treatment options, new medical countermeasures are needed for these viruses classified by the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) as top priority biodefense Category A pathogens. Recombinant consensus interferon alpha (cIFN-a) is a licensed protein with broad clinical appeal. However, while cIFN-a has great therapeutic value, its utility for biodefense applications is hindered by its short in vivo half-life, mode and frequency of administration, and costly production. To address these limitations, we describe the use of DEF201, a replicationdeficient adenovirus vector that drives the expression of cIFN-a, for pre-and post-exposure prophylaxis of acute arenaviral infection modeled in hamsters. Intranasal administration of DEF201 24 h prior to challenge with Pichind\u00e9 virus (PICV) was highly effective at protecting animals from mortality and preventing viral replication and liver-associated disease. A significant protective effect was still observed with a single dosing of DEF201 given two weeks prior to PICV challenge. DEF201 was also efficacious when administered as a treatment 24 to 48 h post-virus exposure. The protective effect of DEF201 was largely attributed to the expression of cIFN-a, as dosing with a control empty vector adenovirus did not protect hamsters from lethal PICV challenge. Effective countermeasures that are highly stable, easily administered, and elicit long lasting protective immunity are much needed for arena and other viral infections. The DEF201 technology has the potential to address all of these issues and may serve as a broad-spectrum antiviral to enhance host defense against a number of viral pathogens.

Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing (mNGS) has been employed to identify uncommon and novel infectious etiologies and characterize virus diversity in human, animal, and environmental samples. Here, we systematically reviewed studies that performed viral mNGS in common livestock (cattle, small ruminants, poultry, and pigs). We identified 2481 records and 120 records were ultimately included after a first and second screening. Pigs were the most frequently studied livestock and the virus diversity found in samples from poultry was the highest. Known animal viruses, zoonotic viruses, and novel viruses were reported in available literature, demonstrating the capacity of mNGS to identify both known and novel viruses. However, the coverage of metagenomic studies was patchy, with few data on the virome of small ruminants and respiratory virome of studied livestock. Essential metadata such as age of livestock and farm types were rarely mentioned in available literature, and only 10.8% of the datasets were publicly available. Developing a deeper understanding of livestock virome is crucial for detection of potential zoonotic and animal pathogens and One Health preparedness. Metagenomic studies can provide this background but only when combined with essential metadata and following the \"FAIR\" (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles. Viruses 2020, 12, 107 2 of 22 flocks and wild birds, suggesting that pre-existing biosecurity measurements could not keep up with the rate of livestock intensification [16] . In 2007-2010, a large-scale Q fever outbreak was reported in the Netherlands, affecting more than 3500 human cases and resulting in a huge economic loss [17, 18] . A steep increase in the number of goat farms most likely was the driver for the increased prevalence of Coxiella burnetii infections, with animal abortion waves that had gone unnoticed. The policy of voluntary reporting abortion outbreaks to the Animal Health Service hindered the timely detection of the circulation of Q fever, and therefore early interventions. These examples indicate that zoonotic risks in the livestock industry should be carefully managed and adapted to livestock intensification. The One Health approach has been coined for advocating collaboration between multiple stakeholders including veterinarians, clinicians, epidemiologists, virologists, microbiologists, ecologists, and policy makers to prevent and control EIDs through the human-animal-environment interface [19] . Surveillance of livestock and the surrounding environment is a hallmark of early detection but is currently targeted to known risks. Advances in Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies and rapid development of bioinformatics and computational tools offer new opportunities for EID surveillance in quality and in scale. Particularly, metagenomic NGS (mNGS) allows unbiased detection of all microbes and viruses in a sample, showing potential for timely detection of rare or novel infectious etiologies, as well as for surveillance of foodborne and waterborne viruses [20] [21] [22][23][24][25][26]. However, the use of mNGS as a potential surveillance tool requires a deeper understanding of what is \"normal\" diversity in humans [27], as well as wildlife [28,29] and farm animals [30]. Characterizing species-specific metagenomes could potentially be used to provide a surveillance baseline for early detection and for tracking of movements of pathogens across different hosts, and has been promoted by projects like the global virome project [31]. However, for such applications, detailed background is needed regarding coverage, representativeness, and biases in the study designs. Here, we conduct a systematic review to identify available literature that performed viral mNGS in common farm animals including cattle, small ruminants (goats and sheep), poultry, and pigs. We reviewed the data and metadata availability and quality of these studies. We further summarized reported viromes of common farm animals in order to translate these efforts as background virus diversity profiles of common farm animals to guide preparedness of diseases at the livestock-human interface. \n Title: viruses Virus Metagenomics in Farm Animals: A Systematic Review", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

We examined whether basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is involved in the regulation of CD13 expression in human melanoma cells. 1F6 human melanoma cells were stably transfected with constructs encoding either the 18 kDa (18kD) or all (ALL) bFGF isoform proteins. We observed highly increased CD13 mRNA and protein expression in the 1F6 clones regardless of the overexpression of either the 18kD or all isoform proteins. Neutral aminopeptidase activity was increased five-fold and could be inhibited by bestatin and the CD13-neutralising antibody WM15. The enhanced invasion through Matrigel, but not migration in a wound assay, was efficiently abrogated by both bestatin and WM15. Upregulation of CD13 expression was the result of increased epithelial and myeloid promoter activity up to 4.5fold in 1F6-18kD and 1F6-ALL clones.

Cattle (n=80), sheep (n=40), goats (n=40), dromedary camels (n=155), and various other camelid species (n=34) were tested for specifi c serum IgG by protein microarray using the receptor-binding S1 subunits of spike proteins of Findings 50 of 50 (100%) sera from Omani camels and 15 of 105 (14%) from Spanish camels had protein-specifi c antibodies against MERS-CoV spike. Sera from European sheep, goats, cattle, and other camelids had no such antibodies. MERS-CoV neutralising antibody titres varied between 1/320 and 1/2560 for the Omani camel sera and between 1/20 and 1/320 for the Spanish camel sera. There was no evidence for cross-neutralisation by bovine coronavirus antibodies. Interpretation MERS-CoV or a related virus has infected camel populations.

Previously, we showed that a histone acetyltransferase (HAT), p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF), binds to XBP-1S and functions as an activator of XBP-1S. Here, we identify general control nonderepressible 5 (GCN5), a HAT with 73% identity to PCAF, as a novel XBP-1S regulator. Both PCAF and GCN5 bind to the same domain of XBP-1S. Surprisingly, GCN5 potently blocks the XBP-1Smediated transcription, including cellular UPR genes and latent membrane protein 1 of Epstein-Barr virus. Unlike PCAF, GCN5 acetylates XBP-1S and enhances nuclear retention and protein stability of XBP-1S. However, such GCN5-mediated acetylation of XBP-1S shows no effects on XBP-1S activity. In addition, the HAT activity of GCN5 is not required for repression of XBP-1S target genes. We further demonstrate that GCN5 inhibits XBP-1S-mediated transcription by disrupting the PCAF-XBP-1S interaction and preventing the recruitment of XBP-1S to its target genes. Taken together, our results represent the first work demonstrating that GCN5 and PCAF exhibit different functions and antagonistically regulate the XBP-1S-mediated transcription.

We aimed to describe the CT findings across different timepoints throughout the disease course. Methods Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (confirmed by next-generation sequencing or RT-PCR) who were admitted to one of two hospitals in Wuhan and who underwent serial chest CT scans were retrospectively enrolled. Patients were grouped on the basis of the interval between symptom onset and the first CT scan: group 1 (subclinical patients; scans done before symptom onset), group 2 (scans done \u22641 week after symptom onset), group 3 (>1 week to 2 weeks), and group 4 (>2 weeks to 3 weeks). Imaging features and their distribution were analysed and compared across the four groups. Findings 81 patients admitted to hospital between Dec 20, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled. The cohort included 42 (52%) men and 39 (48%) women, and the mean age was 49\u00b75 years (SD 11\u00b70). The mean number of involved lung segments was 10\u00b75 (SD 6\u00b74) overall, 2\u00b78 (3\u00b73) in group 1, 11\u00b71 (5\u00b74) in group 2, 13\u00b70 (5\u00b77) in group 3, Interpretation COVID-19 pneumonia manifests with chest CT imaging abnormalities, even in asymptomatic patients, with rapid evolution from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities that progressed to or co-existed with consolidations within 1-3 weeks.

They make it possible to identify and analyze the target protein against a background of a large number of other proteins, either in whole fixed cells or in cell lysates. This chapter describes our experience with the production of such rabbit antisera directed against proteins of coronaviruses and other nidoviruses. The use as antigens of either synthetic peptides (coupled to a carrier protein) or proteins expressed in Escherichia coli is described, and detailed protocols for immunization and preparation of test bleeds are provided. For screening of the immune response following immunization, detailed protocols for three commonly used techniques are described, all of which are based on the use of infected cells or cells expressing the protein of interest, side by side with appropriate controls. The in situ immunodetection of the target in fixed cells by immunofluorescence microscopy is described, as are protocols for techniques that can be applied to cell lysates containing the target protein (Western blotting and immunoprecipitation). The latter techniques are performed in combination with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, thus allowing confirmation of the molecular weight of the target that is recognized by the antiserum. \n Title: Production of Monospecific Rabbit Antisera Recognizing Nidovirus Proteins", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

A macroscopic spatial analysis of HCV infection that can provide scientific information for further intervention and disease control is lacking. Methods: All geo-referenced HCV cases that had been recorded by the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention (CISDCP) during 2005-2011 were included in the study. In order to learn about the changes of demographic characteristics and geographic distribution, trend test and spatial analysis were conducted to reflect the changing pattern of HCV infection. Results: Over 770,000 identified HCV infection cases had specific geographic information during the study period (2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011). Ratios of gender (Male/Female, Z-value = 218.53, P,0.001), age group (#30 years old/$31 years old, Z-value = 2 51.03, P,0.001) and diagnosis type (Clinical diagnosis/Laboratory diagnosis, Z-value = 2130.47, P,0.001) declined. HCV infection was not distributed randomly. Provinces Henan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Xinjiang, and Jilin reported more than 40,000 HCV infections during 2005 to 2011, accounting for 43.91% of all cases. The strength of cluster of disease was increasing in China during the study period. Overall, 11 provinces had once been detected as hotspots during 7 years, most of which were located in the central or border parts of China. Tibet, Qinghai, Jiangxi were the regions that had coldspots. The number of clustering of HCV infection among older adults increased in recent years.

To promote elderly people's behavioral compliance toward influenza prevention, the aim of the current project is to develop, implement, and evaluate a theory-based low-administration-cost intervention building on a leading psychological theory, the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA). The target group is Hong Kong Chinese elderly people aged 65 or older who rarely or never adopt any preventive actions. This project will be conducted in three phases over 24 months. In phase 1, intervention program will be developed building on the HAPA theoretical framework which comprises both the initiation and maintenance of influenza prevention behaviors. In phase 2, intervention will be implemented and evaluated using a randomized controlled trial, including: (a) behavior initiation only, (b) behavior initiation + behavior maintenance, and (c) control group. Both the initiation and maintenance components will comprise weekly-delivered telephone-based individual intervention sessions in 3 months. In phase 3, outcome evaluation of behavioral and psychological variables and process evaluation will be conducted. The effectiveness of the intervention will be analyzed using a series of linear mixed models on each behavioral and psychological outcome variable. Structural equation modelling will be used to test the hypothesized theoretical sequence in the HAPA model. Discussion: The proposed project is expected to design theory-based intervention materials to promote the influenza prevention behaviors in Hong Kong elderly people and provide information on its effectiveness and the potential changing mechanism of behavior initiation and maintenance. \n Title: Promoting influenza prevention for elderly people in Hong Kong using health action process approach: study protocol", "output": "True", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper.

Generation of TCR Tg mice generally requires T cell stimulation and cloning in vitro prior to amplification, processes which introduce biases into selection of the TCR that is ultimately chosen for TCR Tg mouse generation. Here we describe an alternative approach that involves no T cell stimulation or propagation in vitro. We generated mice that were transgenic for a TCR responding to a CD4 T cell epitope (epitope M133) that is immunodominant in mice infected with a neurotropic coronavirus, the JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus. The CD4 T cell response to epitope M133 is of particular interest because it may be pathogenic, protective or regulatory, depending upon the physiological setting. We applied an iterative process in which we identified a TCR-\u03b2 chain expressed by all mice that were examined ('public sequence'). This TCR-\u03b2 chain was introduced into bone marrow cells with a lentivirus vector, generating TCR-\u03b2 retrogenic mice. A TCR-\u03b1 chain that paired with this TCR-\u03b2 was then identified and used to generate a second set of TCR (\u03b1/\u03b2) retrogenic mice. After demonstrating that these cells were functional and responded to epitope M133, these TCR chains were used to generate an epitope M133-specific TCR Tg mouse. This method should be generally useful for engineering TCR Tg mice without introduction of bias caused by in vitro manipulation and propagation. \n Title: Development of transgenic mice expressing a coronavirus-specific public CD4 T cell receptor", "output": "False", "category": "Text Matching 276.json"}]
