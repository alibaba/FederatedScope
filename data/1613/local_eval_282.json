These procedures are suitable for single or repeated use, with the animal in an unrestrained and conscious state.

In the case of kinetoplast DNA, evidence has been presented that the DNA is curved or 'bent'. Bent DNA has previously been found at the lambda and simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA replication origins. Here we show the existence of bent DNA at a yeast autonomously replicating sequence (ARS1), a putative replication origin. The bent DNA has been localized to a 40-55 base pair (bp) segment and contains six (A)3-5 stretches (that is, six poly(A) stretches, three to five nucleotides in length) phased approximately every 10.5 bp. This region contains a DNA binding site for a yeast protein factor. This site lies at the 3' end of the TRP1 gene, in a region devoid of nucleosomes, and is positioned 80 bp away from the ARS consensus sequence; removal of this region impairs ARS function in vivo. The bent DNA may be involved in transcription termination or the prevention of nucleosome assembly in this region. \n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Bent DNA at a yeast autonomously replicating sequence. option2: Differential diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia and usual interstitial pneumonia: clinical, functional, and radiologic findings.", "output": "Bent DNA at a yeast autonomously replicating sequence.", "category": "Text Matching 1251.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, indicate which of the provided candidate titles (Option1 and Option2) best describes it (respond with the text of the title, not option1/2).", "input": "Abstract: During infragenicular bypass, internal occlusion of the distal vessel avoids unnecessary dissection and potentially damaging use of external clamps or vessel loops while improving exposure and patency.

It is here that thymocytes with reactivities to self antigens are eliminated and those with specificities to 'altered' self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene products are positively selected. The selections are presumably carried out on the basis of their T-cell antigen receptors (TcR). The genes of the alpha- and beta-chain T-cell antigen receptors have been cloned. A third T-cell specific gene capable of undergoing somatic rearrangement has also been identified; the role of this third gene is not known. An order of expression of gamma, beta, then alpha is found during T-cell ontogeny. But although alpha- and beta-chain messages are often functional, gamma transcripts are rarely functional in thymocytes or mature T cells. To define the sequential order of expression of these genes further and to continue the search for a possible role for the TcR gamma gene products, we investigated the expression of 'functional' alpha-, beta- and gamma-chain transcripts in young athymic mice. These mice express an undetectable amount (less than one in 8 X 10(5) spleen messages) of 'full-length' alpha- and beta-chain T-cell receptor transcripts, but an increased level of expression of 'full-length' gamma chain messages. Nucleotide sequence analysis of four gamma complementary DNAs show that all four gamma transcripts sequenced are functional. These findings suggest that gamma gene products may be important in a prethymic or extrathymic pathway and may represent a second type of T-cell recognition, possibly in a lineage in which alpha and beta genes are not used. \n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Athymic mice express a high level of functional gamma-chain but greatly reduced levels of alpha- and beta-chain T-cell receptor messages. option2: Percutaneous nephrostolithotomy and lithotripsy: a multi-institutional survey of complications.", "output": "Athymic mice express a high level of functional gamma-chain but greatly reduced levels of alpha- and beta-chain T-cell receptor messages.", "category": "Text Matching 1251.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, indicate which of the provided candidate titles (Option1 and Option2) best describes it (respond with the text of the title, not option1/2).", "input": "Abstract: We have determined the messenger RNA activity profiles of epididymal fat in euthyroid, hypothyroid, and hyperthyroid rats as well as in animals fed a high carbohydrate fat-free (lipogenic) diet. Radioautographs of two-dimensional gels of the in vitro translational products of RNA were quantitated by computer-assisted videodensitometry and analyzed by multivariate statistics. Of the 250 spots observed, each presumably representing the translational product of a separate messenger RNA, 21 were responsive to changes in hormonal state. Eighteen increased and two decreased at some stage in the transition from the hypothyroid to the hyperthyroid state. One spot changed in a biphasic manner. Eight products responded to the lipogenic diet, six increasing and two decreasing. Six of these eight spots responded in a similar fashion to thyroid hormone administration. As previously shown for liver, there appears to be a substantial overlap between the genomic response to carbohydrate and thyroid hormone administration. Whereas the carbohydrate-generated changes are largely included in the thyroid-hormone induced alterations, the majority of thyroid hormone responsive changes are not duplicated by the diet. Multivariate analysis showed a clear separation of each state from the others and revealed that it was necessary to monitor only nine spots to achieve an effective separation of the states analyzed. \n Which is the apt title for the abstract? option1: Effect of thyroid hormones and high carbohydrate feeding on gene expression in rat epididymal adipose tissue. option2: Pulse oximetry for continuous oxygen monitoring in sick newborn infants.", "output": "Effect of thyroid hormones and high carbohydrate feeding on gene expression in rat epididymal adipose tissue.", "category": "Text Matching 1251.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, indicate which of the provided candidate titles (Option1 and Option2) best describes it (respond with the text of the title, not option1/2).", "input": "Abstract: Percutaneous coronary laser thermal angioplasty was successfully performed before conventional balloon angioplasty in a 55 year old white man with a 90% left anterior descending artery stenotic lesion and angina at rest (Canadian Heart Association class IV).

Resistive pressure-vs.-flow relationships for the relaxed respiratory system, lung, and chest wall were also determined; a linear relationship was found for the former (the total passive intrinsic resistance averaged 4.1 cmH2O X l-1 X s), whereas power functions best described the others: the pulmonary pressure-flow relationship exhibited an upward concavity, which for the chest wall presented an upward convexity. The average active elastance and resistance of the respiratory system were, respectively, 64.0 cmH2O X l-1 and 5.4 cmH2O X l-1 X s.

In development of the system, emphasis was placed on providing an anesthesiologist-computer interface that can be adapted to typical situations during anesthesia and to individual user behavior. One main feature of this interface is the integration of the input and output of information. The only device for interaction between the anesthesiologist and the AIS is a touch-sensitive, high-resolution color display screen. The anesthesiologist enters information by touching virtual function keys displayed on the screen. A data window displays all data generated over time, such as automatically recorded vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and rectal and esophageal temperatures, and manually entered variables, such as administered drugs, and ventilator settings. The information gathered by the AIS is presented on the cathode ray tube in several pages. A main distributor page gives an overall view of the content of every work page. A one-page record of the anesthesia is automatically plotted on a multicolor digital plotter during the operation. An example of the use of the AIS is presented from a field test of the system during which it was evaluated in the operating room without interfering with the ongoing operation.
