[{"instruction": "In this task you need to indicate the required knowledge type to solve the pronoun coreference relations. Each of the provided inputs contains a sentence with a target pronoun and a question about the knowledge needed to solve the coreference relation between a noun phrase and the target pronoun. The resolution of the pronoun coreference relations typically involves one or multiple following knowledge types about commonsense: First: 'Property', the knowledge about property of objects (e.g., ice is cold). Second: 'Object', the knowledge about objects (e.g., cats have ears). Third: 'Eventuality', the knowledge about eventuality (e.g., 'wake up' happens before 'open eyes'). Forth: 'Spatial', the knowledge about spatial position (e.g., object at the back can be blocked). Fifth: 'Quantity', the knowledge about numbers (e.g., 2 is smaller than 10).
