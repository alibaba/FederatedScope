I'm not because I can do math.\n\n1.5% income tax represents $36 a month from my paycheck. That's 6 fewer meals with meat for my family, a tank of gasoline, a month's membership at the rock climbing club my son loves. Or about 4 hours extra work for me to offset the lost income and the taxes associated with working those extra hours.\n\nYou see, for the average person, that money comes out of their paycheck FIRST and they don't get it back (if they get it back at all) until May. Our bills come in 52 weeks out of the year, so for 51 weeks out of the year, we'd have to do something to offset that lost income. I'm sure there are people in Alaska who get paid well enough that $40 a month is no big deal to them, but I'm also equally sure that many Alaskans are in the same boat I am. That money represents a line item in our budget that either must be funded or not, but will be felt.\n\nAnd that's if the tax is only 1.5%. I've heard 6%, 15%, and 30% on offer.", "output": "No", "category": "Toxic Language Detection 787.json"}, {"instruction": "Categorize the comment on the basis of toxicity.

Juneau has a 5% sales tax and brings in $43 million spread across about 30,000 residents.  Expand that to the entire state and that brings in about $1 billion.  But it has a few problems:\n1.  Juneau gets a million cruise tourists a year, so sales tax revenue is likely higher there than it would be elsewhere.  In reality the state sales tax would need to be 6% or more.\n2.  Many out-of-state owned businesses skip town without remitting their taxes.  Difficult to enforce when the business is operating in the Virgin Islands or whatever winter cruise port.  It's a perennial problem there.\n3.  A state sales tax would be piled on top of existing municipal sales taxes in the communities that have them (i.e. Juneau would have a 10% sales tax).  So they would have to switch to higher property taxes which the sales tax supporters would probably consider even less fair.\n\nIf you just gotta have a sales tax, make it a big one only in the summer season.", "output": "No", "category": "Toxic Language Detection 787.json"}, {"instruction": "Categorize the comment on the basis of toxicity.
