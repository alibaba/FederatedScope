While various types of histone chaperones have been isolated and functionally analyzed, the elementary processes of nucleosome assembly and disassembly have been less well characterized. Recently, the tertiary structure of a hetero-trimeric complex composed of the histone chaperone CIA/ASF1 and the histone H3-H4 dimer was determined, and this complex was proposed to be an intermediate in nucleosome assembly and disassembly reactions. In addition, CIA alone was biochemically shown to dissociate the histone (H3-H4)2 tetramer into two histone H3-H4 dimers. This activity suggested that CIA regulates the semi-conservative replication of nucleosomes. Here, we provide an overview of prominent histone chaperones with the goal of elucidating the mechanisms that preserve and modify epigenetic information.

In yeast, a mechanistic explanation has been proposed whereby calorie restriction slows aging by activating Sir2. Here we report the identification of a Sir2-independent pathway responsible for a majority of the longevity benefit associated with calorie restriction. Deletion of FOB1 and overexpression of SIR2 have been previously found to increase life span by reducing the levels of toxic rDNA circles in aged mother cells. We find that combining calorie restriction with either of these genetic interventions dramatically enhances longevity, resulting in the longest-lived yeast strain reported thus far. Further, calorie restriction results in a greater life span extension in cells lacking both Sir2 and Fob1 than in cells where Sir2 is present. These findings indicate that Sir2 and calorie restriction act in parallel pathways to promote longevity in yeast and, perhaps, higher eukaryotes.", "output": "Sir2-Independent Life Span Extension by Calorie Restriction in Yeast", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

This complex process is performed by the highly specialized, multinucleated osteoclast. Over the past 15 years, a detailed picture has emerged describing the origins, differentiation pathways and activation stages that contribute to normal osteoclast function. This information has primarily been obtained by the development and skeletal analysis of genetically modified mouse models. Mice harboring mutations in specific genetic loci exhibit bone defects as a direct result of aberrations in normal osteoclast recruitment, formation or function. These findings include the identification of the RANK\u2013RANKL\u2013OPG system as a primary mediator of osteoclastogenesis, the characterization of ion transport and cellular attachment mechanisms and the recognition that matrix-degrading enzymes are essential components of resorptive activity.

The alterations observed by genetic analysis at the iPSC level and at first approximation in early development illustrate the developmental disease transcriptional signature of Down syndrome. Moreover, we observed an abnormal neural differentiation of Down syndrome iPSCs in vivo when formed teratoma in NOD-SCID mice, and in vitro when differentiated into neuroprogenitors and neurons. These defects were associated with changes in the architecture and density of neurons, astroglial and oligodendroglial cells together with misexpression of genes involved in neurogenesis, lineage specification and differentiation. Furthermore, we provide novel evidence that dual-specificity tyrosine-(Y)-phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) on chromosome 21 likely contributes to these defects.

Archival fixed and embedded tissue specimens from women with germ line deleterious mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 were identified. After pathologic review, focal areas of normal breast epithelium, atypical ductal hyperplasia, ductal carcinoma-in-situ, and invasive ductal carcinoma were identified from 14 BRCA1-linked and 9 BRCA2-linked breast cancers. Ten BRCA-linked prophylactic mastectomy specimens and 12 BRCA-linked invasive ovarian carcinomas were also studied. Laser catapult microdissection was used to isolate cells from the various pathologic lesions and corresponding normal tissues. After DNA isolation, real-time polymerase chain reaction assays were used to quantitate the proportion of wild-type to mutant BRCA alleles in each tissue sample. Quantitative allelotyping of microdissected cells revealed a high level of heterogeneity in loss of heterozygosity within and between preinvasive lesions and invasive cancers from BRCA1 and BRCA2 heterozygotes with breast cancer. In contrast, all BRCA-associated ovarian cancers displayed complete loss of the wild-type BRCA allele.

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA Data were gathered from the observational cohort of the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT). Patients in the observational cohort met eligibility requirements identical to those of the randomized cohort, but declined randomization, receiving instead the treatment of their choice.   \n METHODS Baseline preference and expectation data were acquired at the time of enrollment of the patient, before exposure to the informed consent process. Univariate analyses were performed using a t test for continuous variables and chi for categorical variables. Multivariate analyses were also performed with ANCOVA for continuous variables and logistic regression for categorical variables. Multiple logistic regression models were developed in a forward stepwise fashion using blocks of variables.   \n RESULTS More patients preferred operative care: 67% preferred surgery, 28% preferred nonoperative treatment, and 6% were unsure; 53% of those preferring surgery stated a definite preference, whereas only 18% of those preferring nonoperative care had a definite preference. Patients preferring surgery were younger, had lower levels of education, and higher levels of unemployment/disability. This group also reported higher pain, worse physical and mental functioning, more back pain related disability, a longer duration of symptoms, and more opiate use. Gender, race, comorbidities, and use of other therapies did not differ significantly across preference groups. Patients' expectations regarding improvement with nonoperative care was the strongest predictor of preference.   \n CONCLUSION Patient expectations, particularly regarding the benefit of nonoperative treatment, are the primary determinant of surgery preference among patients with lumbar intervertebral disc herniation.

Yet, the mechanisms specifying diverse dendritic morphologies, and the extent to which their function depends on these morphologies, remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate a requirement for the microtubule-severing protein katanin p60-like 1 (Kat-60L1) in regulating the elaborate dendrite morphology and nocifensive functions of Drosophila larval class IV dendritic arborization neurons. Kat-60L1 mutants exhibit diminished responsiveness to noxious mechanical and thermal stimuli. Class IV dendrite branch number and length are also reduced, supporting a correspondence between neuronal function and the full extent of the dendritic arbor. These arborization defects occur particularly in late larval development, and live imaging reveals that Kat-60L1 is required for dynamic, filopodia-like nascent branches to stabilize during this stage. Mutant dendrites exhibit fewer EB1-GFP-labeled microtubules, suggesting that Kat-60L1 increases polymerizing microtubules to establish terminal branch stability and full arbor complexity. Although loss of the related microtubule-severing protein Spastin also reduces the class IV dendrite arbor, microtubule polymerization within dendrites is unaffected. Conversely, Spastin overexpression destroys stable microtubules within these neurons, while Kat-60L1 has no effect. Kat-60L1 thus sculpts the class IV dendritic arbor through microtubule regulatory mechanisms distinct from Spastin.

Participants were adults aged 25 through 64 years with dispensed prescriptions for methylphenidate, amphetamine, or atomoxetine at baseline. Each medication user (n = 150,359) was matched to 2 nonusers on study site, birth year, sex, and calendar year (443,198 total users and nonusers).   \n MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction (MI), sudden cardiac death (SCD), or stroke, with comparison between current or new users and remote users to account for potential healthy-user bias.   \n RESULTS During 806,182 person-years of follow-up (median, 1.3 years per person), 1357 cases of MI, 296 cases of SCD, and 575 cases of stroke occurred. There were 107,322 person-years of current use (median, 0.33 years), with a crude incidence per 1000 person-years of 1.34 (95% CI, 1.14-1.57) for MI, 0.30 (95% CI, 0.20-0.42) for SCD, and 0.56 (95% CI, 0.43-0.72) for stroke. The multivariable-adjusted rate ratio (RR) of serious cardiovascular events for current use vs nonuse of ADHD medications was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.72-0.96). Among new users of ADHD medications, the adjusted RR was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.63-0.94).

Since both diseases are associated with the HLA class II genes on chromosome 6p21, we tested whether non-HLA loci are shared.   \n METHODS We evaluated the association between type 1 diabetes and eight loci related to the risk of celiac disease by genotyping and statistical analyses of DNA samples from 8064 patients with type 1 diabetes, 9339 control subjects, and 2828 families providing 3064 parent-child trios (consisting of an affected child and both biologic parents). We also investigated 18 loci associated with type 1 diabetes in 2560 patients with celiac disease and 9339 control subjects.   \n RESULTS Three celiac disease loci--RGS1 on chromosome 1q31, IL18RAP on chromosome 2q12, and TAGAP on chromosome 6q25--were associated with type 1 diabetes (P<1.00x10(-4)). The 32-bp insertion-deletion variant on chromosome 3p21 was newly identified as a type 1 diabetes locus (P=1.81x10(-8)) and was also associated with celiac disease, along with PTPN2 on chromosome 18p11 and CTLA4 on chromosome 2q33, bringing the total number of loci with evidence of a shared association to seven, including SH2B3 on chromosome 12q24.

Evidence is presented to support the theory of secondary injury and the hypothesis that a key mechanism is posttraumatic ischemia with resultant infarction of the spinal cord. Evidence for the role of vascular mechanisms has been obtained from a variety of models of acute spinal cord injury in several species. Many different angiographic methods have been used for assessing microcirculation of the cord and for measuring spinal cord blood flow after trauma. With these techniques, the major systemic and local vascular effects of acute spinal cord injury have been identified and implicated in the etiology of secondary injury. The systemic effects of acute spinal cord injury include hypotension and reduced cardiac output. The local effects include loss of autoregulation in the injured segment of the spinal cord and a marked reduction of the microcirculation in both gray and white matter, especially in hemorrhagic regions and in adjacent zones. The microcirculatory loss extends for a considerable distance proximal and distal to the site of injury. Many studies have shown a dose-dependent reduction of spinal cord blood flow varying with the severity of injury, and a reduction of spinal cord blood flow which worsens with time after injury. The functional deficits due to acute spinal cord injury have been measured electrophysiologically with techniques such as motor and somatosensory evoked potentials and have been found proportional to the degree of posttraumatic ischemia. The histological effects include early hemorrhagic necrosis leading to major infarction at the injury site. These posttraumatic vascular effects can be treated. Systemic normotension can be restored with volume expansion or vasopressors, and spinal cord blood flow can be improved with dopamine, steroids, nimodipine, or volume expansion. The combination of nimodipine and volume expansion improves posttraumatic spinal cord blood flow and spinal cord function measured by evoked potentials. These results provide strong evidence that posttraumatic ischemia is an important secondary mechanism of injury, and that it can be counteracted.", "output": "Review of the secondary injury theory of acute spinal cord trauma with emphasis on vascular mechanisms.", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

This was the total number assessed as suitable for radical treatment by one consultant during 1999. At the time of assessment they had been newly diagnosed and staged with a computed tomographic (CT) scan of chest. They had a subsequent CT scan prior to starting treatment for the purpose of planning the radiation fields. We have now measured tumour size on the diagnostic scans and compared this with the size on the planning scans. We have documented the delay between diagnostic and planning CT scanning and the total time between first hospital visit and starting treatment. Two patients had progression of symptoms while on the waiting list, making them unfit for radical treatment, and another four had tumour progression on planning CT such that the tumour volume was too large for radical treatment. Therefore, 21% of potentially curable patients became incurable on the waiting list. The delay between diagnostic and planning CT scans ranged from 18 to 131 days (median 54), with increases in the cross-sectional tumour size over that period ranging zero to 373%. The delay between the first hospital visit and starting treatment was 35-187 days (median 94); between the date of the radiotherapy request and the starting date for treatment it was 23-61 days (median 44). Limited access to specialists is the reason most often advanced for the poor performance of the UK in treating lung cancer.

Recently developed methods for species-tree estimation that not only consider the retention and sorting of ancestral polymorphism but also quantify the actual probabilities of incomplete lineage sorting are expected to provide an improvement over earlier summary-statistic based approaches that discard much of the information content of gene trees. However, these new methods have yet to be tested on truly challenging evolutionary histories such as those marked by recent rapid speciation where high levels of incomplete lineage sorting and discord among gene trees predominate. Here, we test a new maximum-likelihood method that incorporates stochastic models of both nucleotide substitution and lineage sorting for species-tree estimation. Using a simulation approach, we consider a broad range of species-tree topologies under 2 scenarios representing moderate and severe incomplete lineage sorting. We show that the maximum-likelihood method results in more accurate species trees than a summary-statistic based approach, demonstrating that information contained in discordant gene trees can be effectively extracted using a full probabilistic model. Moreover, we demonstrate that the shape of the original species tree (i.e., the relative lengths of internal branches) has a significant impact on whether the species tree is estimated accurately. In the speciation histories explored here, it is not just the recent origin of species that affects the accuracy of the estimates but the variance in relative species divergence times as well. Additionally, we show that sampling effort (number of individuals and/or loci) and sampling design (ratio of individuals to loci) are both important factors affecting the accuracy of species-tree estimates, which is again affected by the relative timing of divergence among species. The inherent difficulties of estimating relationships when species have undergone a recent radiation are discussed, and in particular, the limitations with maximum-likelihood estimates of species trees that do not consider uncertainty in the estimated gene trees of individual loci. Thus, despite substantial improvements over current summary-statistic based approaches, and the increased sophistication of procedures that incorporate the process of gene lineage coalescence, recent radiations still appear to pose daunting challenges for phylogenetics.", "output": "Maximum likelihood estimates of species trees: how accuracy of phylogenetic inference depends upon the divergence history and sampling design.", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

Such indices potentially provide more specific markers of white matter microstructure than standard indices from diffusion tensor imaging. Orientational invariance allows for combination with tractography and presents new opportunities for mapping brain connectivity and quantifying disease processes. The technique uses a four-compartment tissue model combined with an optimized multishell high-angular-resolution pulsed-gradient-spin-echo acquisition. We test the method in simulation, on fixed monkey brains using a preclinical scanner and on live human brains using a clinical 3T scanner. The human data take about one hour to acquire. The simulation experiments show that both monkey and human protocols distinguish distributions of axon diameters that occur naturally in white matter. We compare the axon diameter index with the mean axon diameter weighted by axon volume. The index differs from this mean and is protocol dependent, but correlation is good for the monkey protocol and weaker, but discernible, for the human protocol where greater diffusivity and lower gradient strength limit sensitivity to only the largest axons. Maps of axon diameter and density indices from the monkey and human data in the corpus callosum and corticospinal tract reflect known trends from histology. The results show orientationally invariant sensitivity to natural axon diameter distributions for the first time with both specialist and clinical hardware.

Field-based analyses of malaria transmission have frequently relied on the prevalence of asexual parasites or gametocytes as proxies for infectiousness. We now summarize empirical data on human infectiousness from Africa and Papua New Guinea. Over a wide range of transmission intensities there is little relationship between the infectiousness of human populations to vector mosquitoes and mosquito-to-human transmission intensity. We compare these data with the predictions of a stochastic simulation model of Plasmodium falciparum epidemiology. This model predicted little variation in the infectiousness of the human population for entomologic inoculation rates (EIRs) greater than approximately 10 infectious bites per year, demonstrating that the lack of relationship between the EIR and the infectious reservoir can be explained without invoking any effects of acquired transmission-blocking immunity. The near absence of field data from areas with an EIR < 10 per year precluded validation of the model predictions for low EIR values. These results suggest that interventions reducing mosquito-to-human transmission will have little or no effect on human infectiousness at the levels of transmission found in most rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa.

Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain compartmental cell sorting, mainly differential adhesion, but also regulation of the cytoskeleton or of cell proliferation. Nevertheless, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that keep cells apart at boundaries remain unclear. Here we demonstrate, in early Drosophila melanogaster embryos, that actomyosin-based barriers stop cells from invading neighbouring compartments. Our analysis shows that cells can transiently invade neighbouring compartments, especially when they divide, but are then pushed back into their compartment of origin. Actomyosin cytoskeletal components are enriched at compartmental boundaries, forming cable-like structures when the epidermis is mitotically active. When MyoII (non-muscle myosin II) function is inhibited, including locally at the cable by chromophore-assisted laser inactivation (CALI), in live embryos, dividing cells are no longer pushed back, leading to compartmental cell mixing.

The VEGF/VEGF-receptor axis is composed of multiple ligands and receptors with overlapping and distinct ligand-receptor binding specificities, cell-type expression, and function. Activation of the VEGF-receptor pathway triggers a network of signaling processes that promote endothelial cell growth, migration, and survival from pre-existing vasculature. In addition, VEGF mediates vessel permeability, and has been associated with malignant effusions.

Studies with various anti-VEGF/VEGF-receptor therapies have shown that these agents can potently inhibit angiogenesis and tumor growth in preclinical models.

The polyprotein P123 is produced when translation terminates at an opal termination codon between nsP3 and nsP4. The polyprotein P1234 is produced when translational readthrough occurs or when the opal termination codon has been replaced by a sense codon in the alphavirus genome. Evolutionary pressures appear to have maintained genomic sequences encoding both a stop codon (opal) and an open reading frame (arginine) as a general feature of the O'nyong-nyong virus (ONNV) genome, indicating that both are required at some point. Alternate replication of ONNVs in both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts may determine predominance of a particular codon at this locus in the viral quasispecies. However, no systematic study has previously tested this hypothesis in whole animals. We report here the results of the first study to investigate in a natural mosquito host the functional significance of the opal stop codon in an alphavirus genome. We used a full-length cDNA clone of ONNV to construct a series of mutants in which the arginine between nsP3 and nsP4 was replaced with an opal, ochre, or amber stop codon. The presence of an opal stop codon upstream of nsP4 nearly doubled (75.5%) the infectivity of ONNV over that of virus possessing a codon for the amino acid arginine at the corresponding position (39.8%). Although the frequency with which the opal virus disseminated from the mosquito midgut did not differ significantly from that of the arginine virus on days 8 and 10, dissemination did began earlier in mosquitoes infected with the opal virus. Although a clear fitness advantage is provided to ONNV by the presence of an opal codon between nsP3 and nsP4 in Anopheles gambiae, sequence analysis of ONNV RNA extracted from mosquito bodies and heads indicated codon usage at this position corresponded with that of the virus administered in the blood meal. These results suggest that while selection of ONNV variants is occurring, de novo mutation at the position between nsP3 and nsP4 does not readily occur in the mosquito. Taken together, these results suggest that the primary fitness advantage provided to ONNV by the presence of an opal codon between nsP3 and nsP4 is related to mosquito infectivity.", "output": "Effects of an opal termination codon preceding the nsP4 gene sequence in the O'Nyong-Nyong virus genome on Anopheles gambiae infectivity.", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

Although the amino acid sequences of plant and bacterial ureases are closely related, some biological activities differ significantly. Plant ureases but not bacterial ureases possess insecticidal properties independent of its ureolytic activity. To date, the structural information is available only for bacterial ureases although the jack bean urease (Canavalia ensiformis; JBU), the best-studied plant urease, was the first enzyme to be crystallized in 1926. To better understand the biological properties of plant ureases including the mechanism of insecticidal activity, we initiated the structural studies on some of them. Here, we report the crystal structure of JBU, the first plant urease structure, at 2.05 A resolution. The active-site architecture of JBU is similar to that of bacterial ureases containing a bi-nickel center. JBU has a bound phosphate and covalently modified residue (Cys592) by beta-mercaptoethanol at its active site, and the concomitant binding of multiple inhibitors (phosphate and beta-mercaptoethanol) is not observed so far in bacterial ureases. By correlating the structural information of JBU with the available biophysical and biochemical data on insecticidal properties of plant ureases, we hypothesize that the amphipathic beta-hairpin located in the entomotoxic peptide region of plant ureases might form a membrane insertion beta-barrel as found in beta-pore-forming toxins.", "output": "Crystal structure of the first plant urease from jack bean: 83 years of journey from its first crystal to molecular structure.", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

Here, we review the targeted therapies that have been reported or are in ongoing urothelial carcinoma clinical trials, and highlight molecular targets characterized in preclinical and clinical studies.    RECENT FINDINGS Trials in nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer are evaluating the role of immunotherapy and agents targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or fibroblast growth factor receptor-3. In muscle-invasive bladder cancer, neoadjuvant studies have focused on combining VEGF agents with chemotherapy; adjuvant studies are testing vaccines and agents targeting the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, p53, and Hsp27. In the first-line treatment of metastatic urothelial carcinoma, tubulin, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4, Hsp27, and p53 are novel targets in clinical trials. The majority of targeted agents studied in urothelial carcinoma are in the second-line setting; new targets include CD105, polo-like kinase-1, phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI3K), transforming growth factor \u03b2 receptor/activin receptor-like kinase \u03b2, estrogen receptor, and the hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR or MET).

In this organism, RNAi can be triggered either by high-copy, truncated transgenes or by directly feeding cells with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Surprisingly, dsRNA-induced silencing depends on the putatively functional RDR1 and RDR2 genes, which are required for the accumulation of both primary siRNAs and a distinct class of small RNAs suggestive of secondary siRNAs. In contrast, a third gene with a highly divergent catalytic domain, RDR3, is required for siRNA accumulation when RNAi is triggered by truncated transgenes. Our data further implicate RDR3 in the accumulation of previously described endogenous siRNAs and in the regulation of the surface antigen gene family. While only one of these genes is normally expressed in any clonal cell line, the knockdown of RDR3 leads to co-expression of multiple antigens.

We have examined the involvement of acidic intracellular compartments in APP processing in cultured human cells. The use of acidotropic agents and inhibitors to a specific class of lysosomal protease, coupled with metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation, revealed that APP is degraded within an acidic compartment to produce at least 12 COOH-terminal fragments. Nine likely contain the entire beta/A4 domain and, therefore, are potentially amyloidogenic. Treatment with E64 or Z-Phe-Ala-CHN2 irreversibly blocked activities of the lysosomal cysteine proteases cathepsins B and L but did not inhibit the lysosomal aspartic protease cathepsin D and did not alter the production of potentially amyloidogenic fragments. Instead, the inhibitors prevented further degradation of the fragments. Thus, large numbers of potentially amyloidogenic fragments of APP are routinely generated in an acidic compartment by noncysteine proteases and then are eliminated within lysosomes by cysteine proteases. Immunoblot and immunohistochemical analyses confirmed that chronic cysteine protease inhibition leads to accumulation of potentially amyloidogenic APP fragments in lysosomes.

We have supplemented these studies with data collected from fixed, stained, whole embryos. The following information has been obtained. The average duration of nuclear cycles 10, 11, 12 and 13 is about 9, 10, 12 and 21 min, respectively (25 degrees C). In these four cycles, the duration of that portion of the mitotic period that lacks a discrete nuclear envelope is 3, 3, 3 and 5 min, respectively. The length of nuclear cycle 14 varies in a position-specific manner throughout the embryo, the shortest cycles being of 65 min duration. During nuclear cycles 10 through 13, it is commonly observed in living embryos that the syncytial blastoderm nuclei enter (and leave) mitosis in one of two waves that originate nearly simultaneously from the opposite anterior and posterior poles of the embryo, and terminate in its midregion. From our preparations of quick-frozen embryos, we estimate that these mitotic waves take on average about half a minute to travel over the embryonic surface from pole to equator. The yolk nuclei, which remain in the core of the embryo when the rest of the nuclei migrate to the periphery, divide in synchrony with the migrating nuclei at nuclear cycles 8 and 9, and just after the now peripherally located nuclei at nuclear cycle 10. After cycle 10, these yolk nuclei cease dividing and become polyploid. The syncytial embryo has at least three distinct levels of cytoskeletal organization: structured domains of cytoplasm are organized around each blastoderm nucleus; radially directed tracks orient colchicine-sensitive saltatory transport throughout the peripheral cytoplasm; and a long-range organization of the core of the embryo makes possible coherent movements of the large inner yolk mass in concert with each nuclear cycle.

ADLTE is characterized by partial seizures with symptoms suggestive of a lateral temporal onset, including frequent auditory aura. Here we report the results of clinical and genetic analyses of two newly identified families with ADTLE.   \n METHODS We identified two families whose seizure semiology was suggestive of ADLTE. Evaluation included a detailed history and neurologic examination, as well as collection of DNA. The coding sequence of the LGI1 gene from affected subjects from both families was analyzed for evidence of mutation.   \n RESULTS Each patient had a history of partial seizures, often with secondary generalization earlier in the course. Auditory aura was reported by approximately two thirds of affected patients in each pedigree. Novel mutations in LGI1 were detected in both families. A heterozygous single-nucleotide deletion at position 329 (del 329C) was detected in affected individuals from one family, whereas patients from the second family had a nonsynonymous variation, corresponding to C435G.   \n CONCLUSIONS We identified two novel mutations in the LGI1 gene. The phenotype of these two families was similar to that of other kindreds with ADLTE, as auditory aura was absent in one third of affected individuals.

Women were followed up for an average of 13.3 years to document any breast cancer incidence. Lobular involution was categorized as none, partial, or complete; parenchymal pattern was classified using the Wolfe classification as N1 (nondense), P1, P2 (ductal prominence occupying <25%, or >25% of the breast, respectively), or DY (extremely dense). Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess associations of lobular involution and MBD with breast cancer risk were estimated using adjusted Cox proportional hazards model. All tests of statistical significance were two-sided.   \n RESULTS After adjustment for MBD, having no or partial lobular involution was associated with a higher risk of breast cancer than having complete involution (none: HR of breast cancer incidence = 2.62, 95% CI = 1.39 to 4.94; partial: HR of breast cancer incidence = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.03 to 2.53; P(trend) = .002).

We evaluated the renoprotective effects of dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by adding treatment with aliskiren, an oral direct renin inhibitor, to treatment with the maximal recommended dose of losartan (100 mg daily) and optimal antihypertensive therapy in patients who had hypertension and type 2 diabetes with nephropathy.   \n METHODS We enrolled 599 patients in this multinational, randomized, double-blind study. After a 3-month, open-label, run-in period during which patients received 100 mg of losartan daily, patients were randomly assigned to receive 6 months of treatment with aliskiren (150 mg daily for 3 months, followed by an increase in dosage to 300 mg daily for another 3 months) or placebo, in addition to losartan. The primary outcome was a reduction in the ratio of albumin to creatinine, as measured in an early-morning urine sample, at 6 months.   \n RESULTS The baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar. Treatment with 300 mg of aliskiren daily, as compared with placebo, reduced the mean urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio by 20% (95% confidence interval, 9 to 30; P<0.001), with a reduction of 50% or more in 24.7% of the patients who received aliskiren as compared with 12.5% of those who received placebo (P<0.001).

The goals of this workshop were to identify key scientific issues, gaps, and opportunities that have emerged since the Enterprise Strategic Plan was first published in 2005 [1], and to make recommendations that Enterprise stakeholders can use to plan new activities.     Most effective viral vaccines work, at least in part, by generating antibodies that inactivate or neutralize the invading virus, and the existing data strongly suggest that an optimally effective HIV-1 vaccine should elicit potent antiviral neutralizing antibodies. However, unlike acute viral pathogens, HIV-1 chronically replicates in the host and evades the antibody response. This immune evasion, along with the large genetic variation among HIV-1 strains worldwide, has posed major obstacles to vaccine development. Current HIV vaccine candidates do not elicit neutralizing antibodies against most circulating virus strains, and thus the induction of a protective antibody response remains a major priority for HIV-1 vaccine development. For an antibody-based HIV-1 vaccine, progress in vaccine design is generally gauged by in vitro assays that measure the ability of vaccine-induced antibodies to neutralize a broad spectrum of viral isolates representing the major genetic subtypes (clades) of HIV-1 [2]. Although it is not known what magnitude and breadth of neutralization will predict protection in vaccine recipients, it is clear that current vaccine immunogens elicit antibodies that neutralize only a minority of circulating isolates. Thus, much progress needs to be made in this area. Also, though virus neutralization is considered a critical benchmark for a vaccine, this may not be the only benchmark for predicting success with antibody-based HIV-1 vaccine immunogens.     The main targets for neutralizing antibodies to HIV-1 are the surface gp120 and trans-membrane gp41 envelope glycoproteins (Env) that mediate receptor and coreceptor binding and the subsequent membrane fusion events that allow the virus to gain entry into cells [3]. Antibodies neutralize the virus by binding these viral spikes and blocking virus entry into susceptible cells, such as CD4+ T cells [4,5]. In order to chronically replicate in the host, the virus exploits several mechanisms to shield itself against antibody recognition, including a dense outer coating of sugar molecules (N-linked glycans) and the strategic positioning of cysteine\u2013cysteine loop structures on the gp120 molecule [6\u20138]. These shielding mechanisms, although highly effective, have vulnerabilities imposed by fitness constraints. Information on the precise location and molecular structure of these vulnerable regions could be valuable for the rational design of improved vaccine immunogens.     Participants in the workshop identified four areas that, if given proper attention, could provide key information that would bring the field closer to an effective antibody-based HIV-1 vaccine: (1) structure-assisted immunogen design, (2) role of Fc receptors and complement, (3) assay standardization and validation, and (4) immunoregulation of B cell responses.", "output": "Antibody-Based HIV-1 Vaccines: Recent Developments and Future Directions", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

It has been proposed that possible actions of visfatin are mediated through the extracellular formation of NMN. However, we did not detect NMN in mouse blood plasma, even with a highly specific and sensitive liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Furthermore, there is no or little ATP, the activator of NAMPT, in extracellular spaces. We thus questioned whether visfatin catalyzes the in situ formation of NMN under such extracellular milieus. To address this question, we here determined K(m) values for the substrates Nam and PRPP in the NAMPT reaction without or with ATP using a recombinant human enzyme and found that 1 mM ATP dramatically decreases K(m) values for the substrates, in particular PRPP to its intracellular concentration. Consistent with the kinetic data, only when ATP is present at millimolar levels, NAMPT efficiently catalyzed the NMN formation at the intracellular concentrations of the substrates. Much lower concentrations of Nam and almost the absence of PRPP and ATP in the blood plasma suggest that NAMPT should not efficiently catalyze its reaction under the extracellular milieu. Indeed, NAMPT did not form NMN in the blood plasma. From these kinetic analyses of the enzyme and quantitative determination of its substrates, activator, and product, we conclude that visfatin does not participate in NMN formation under the extracellular milieus.

Sputum was also analysed for mRNA levels of haemoxygenase-1, tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1, RANTES, interleukin 5(IL-5), IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, transforming growth factor-\u03b2, and interferon-\u03b3.    STATISTICS Cox regression analyses were performed using time to exacerbation as outcome variable to identify significant hazards for a COPD exacerbation after ICS withdrawal.   \n RESULTS Higher sputum % eosinophils, higher sputum MPO/neutrophil level, longer duration of COPD symptoms, <40 packyears smoking, and ICS withdrawal in November, December or January were significant hazards (all p<0.05) for experiencing a COPD exacerbation after ICS withdrawal in a monovariate model. In a multivariate model, all factors proved independent predictors except for sputum MPO/neutrophil level.   \n CONCLUSIONS Decisions on whether or not inhaled corticosteroids can be safely withdrawn in mild-to-moderate COPD can be facilitated by assessment of sputum inflammation, particularly eosinophil numbers, next to packyears smoking, season, and duration of COPD symptoms.", "output": "Sputum inflammation predicts exacerbations after cessation of inhaled corticosteroids in COPD.", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

This 64 kDa protein, encoded by svpA, is both secreted in culture supernatants and surface-exposed, as shown by immunogold labelling of whole bacteria with an anti-SvpA antibody. Analysis of the peptide sequence revealed that SvpA contains a leader peptide, a predicted C-terminal transmembrane region and a positively charged tail resembling that of the surface protein ActA, suggesting that SvpA might partially reassociate with the bacterial surface by its C-terminal membrane anchor. An allelic mutant was constructed by disrupting svpA in the wild-type strain LO28. The virulence of this mutant was strongly attenuated in the mouse, with a 2 log decrease in the LD50 and restricted bacterial growth in organs as compared to the wild-type strain. This reduced virulence was not related either to a loss of adherence or to a lower expression of known virulence factors, which remained unaffected in the svpA mutant. It was caused by a restriction of intracellular growth of mutant bacteria. By following the intracellular behaviour of bacteria within bone-marrow-derived macrophages by confocal and electron microscopy studies, it was found that most svpA mutant bacteria remained confined within phagosomes, in contrast to wild-type bacteria which rapidly escaped to the cytoplasm. The regulation of svpA was independent of PrfA, the transcriptional activator of virulence genes in L. monocytogenes. In fact, SvpA was down-regulated by MecA, ClpC and ClpP, which are highly homologous to proteins of Bacillus subtilis forming a regulatory complex controlling the competence state of this saprophyte. The results indicate that: (i) SvpA is a novel factor involved in the virulence of L. monocytogenes, promoting bacterial escape from phagosomes of macrophages; (ii) SvpA is, at least partially, associated with the surface of bacteria; and (iii) SvpA is PrfA-independent and controlled by a MecA-dependent regulatory network.", "output": "SvpA, a novel surface virulence-associated protein required for intracellular survival of Listeria monocytogenes.", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

Interleukin-6 receptor (IL6R) signalling propagates downstream inflammation cascades. To assess whether this pathway is causally relevant to coronary heart disease, we studied a functional genetic variant known to affect IL6R signalling.   \n METHODS In a collaborative meta-analysis, we studied Asp358Ala (rs2228145) in IL6R in relation to a panel of conventional risk factors and inflammation biomarkers in 125,222 participants. We also compared the frequency of Asp358Ala in 51,441 patients with coronary heart disease and in 136,226 controls. To gain insight into possible mechanisms, we assessed Asp358Ala in relation to localised gene expression and to postlipopolysaccharide stimulation of interleukin 6.   \n FINDINGS The minor allele frequency of Asp358Ala was 39%. Asp358Ala was not associated with lipid concentrations, blood pressure, adiposity, dysglycaemia, or smoking (p value for association per minor allele \u22650\u00b704 for each). By contrast, for every copy of 358Ala inherited, mean concentration of IL6R increased by 34\u00b73% (95% CI 30\u00b74-38\u00b72) and of interleukin 6 by 14\u00b76% (10\u00b77-18\u00b74), and mean concentration of C-reactive protein was reduced by 7\u00b75% (5\u00b79-9\u00b71) and of fibrinogen by 1\u00b70% (0\u00b77-1\u00b73).

Although Th2 clones apparently showed higher IL-10 mRNA levels, IL-10 mRNA expression was consistently found in Th1 clones, as well. Likewise, measurable IL-10 levels were found in the supernatants of both Th1 and Th2 clones. The effect of human IL-10 (h-IL-10) and viral IL-10 (v-IL-10) on the proliferative response and cytokine production by Th1 and Th2 human clones was also investigated. Addition in culture of h-IL-10 and v-IL-10 significantly reduced the proliferation of both Th1 and Th2 clones in response to the specific Ag and to PHA, but it had no inhibitory effect on the proliferative response of Th1 and Th2 clones to IL-2. h-IL-10 and v-IL-10 also inhibited the Ag-induced production of gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma) by Th1 clones and the production of IL-4 and IL-5 by Th2 clones, whereas they had no effect on the cytokine synthesis by the same clones stimulated with PMA plus anti-CD3 antibody. Preincubation of APC, but not of clonal T blasts, with h-IL-10 resulted in the inhibition of Ag-induced proliferation of both Th1 and Th2 clones, supporting the view that h-IL-10 primarily affects APC.

Although female gender carries a higher risk of developing relapsing remitting MS, being female and at child-bearing age also appears to provide some protection against cognitive decline and against progressive onset MS, an adverse predictive factor when considering long-term disability in MS. The risk of MS in women has been associated with an earlier age at menarche. In most studies, parity did not impact MS risk. However, the recently published association of higher parity and offspring number with a reduced risk of a first demyelinating event suggests a potential suppressive effect. Pregnancy in MS patients has been associated with a reduced relapse rate and a reduction of neurological symptoms, especially in the third trimester. Despite the increased relapse risk in the postpartum period, there is no indication of an adverse effect of childbirth on the long-term course of MS. Fertility treatment in MS has been associated with an increased relapse risk in the following 3-month period, especially when the procedure did not result in pregnancy and gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists were used. Altogether, there is substantial evidence to support a regulatory role of sex steroid hormones in MS.

Caused by an expanded polyglutamine tract in ataxin 1 (ATXN1), SCA1 pathogenesis involves a multifactorial process that likely begins with misfolding of ATXN1, which has functional consequences on its interactions, leading to transcriptional dysregulation. Because lithium has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects in a variety of conditions, possibly by affecting gene expression, we tested the efficacy of lithium treatment in a knock-in mouse model of SCA1 (Sca1154Q/2Q mice) that replicates many features of the human disease.   Methods and Findings  Sca1154Q/2Q mice and their wild-type littermates were fed either regular chow or chow that contained 0.2% lithium carbonate. Dietary lithium carbonate supplementation resulted in improvement of motor coordination, learning, and memory in Sca1154Q/2Q mice. Importantly, motor improvement was seen when treatment was initiated both presymptomatically and after symptom onset. Neuropathologically, lithium treatment attenuated the reduction of dendritic branching in mutant hippocampal pyramidal neurons. We also report that lithium treatment restored the levels of isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (Icmt; alternatively, Pccmt), down-regulation of which is an early marker of mutant ATXN1 toxicity.

Vaccination with wP induced a more rapid clearance compared with na\u00efve and aP-vaccinated animals. By comparison, previously infected animals were not colonized upon secondary infection. Although all vaccinated and previously infected animals had robust serum antibody responses, we found key differences in T-cell immunity. Previously infected animals and wP-vaccinated animals possess strong B. pertussis-specific T helper 17 (Th17) memory and Th1 memory, whereas aP vaccination induced a Th1/Th2 response instead.

In addition to the identification of unanticipated brain MRI abnormalities suggestive of demyelinating disease in patients undergoing neuroimaging for a medical reason other than evaluation for multiple sclerosis (MS), asymptomatic spinal cord lesions are periodically identified.   \n OBJECTIVE To determine if asymptomatic spinal cord lesions are associated with clinical progression in subjects with radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS).   \n METHODS A retrospective review of RIS cases at the University of California, San Francisco Multiple Sclerosis Center was performed. The presence of asymptomatic cervical spinal cord MRI lesions was analyzed as a potential predictor for clinical progression.   \n RESULTS Twenty-five of 71 subjects with RIS possessed findings within the cervical spine that were highly suggestive of demyelinating disease. Of these subjects, 21 (84%) progressed clinically to clinically isolated syndrome (n = 19) or primary progressive multiple sclerosis (n = 2) over a median time of 1.6 years from the date of RIS identification (interquartile range 0.8-3.8). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of an asymptomatic spinal cord lesion for subsequent development of either a first demyelinating attack or primary progressive MS were 87.5%, 91.5%, and 84%, respectively. The odds ratio of clinical progression was 75.3 (95% confidence interval 16.1-350.0, p < 0.0001). This association remained significant after adjusting for potential confounders.   \n CONCLUSION These findings suggest that the presence of asymptomatic spinal cord lesions place subjects with RIS at substantial risk for clinical conversion to either an acute or progressive event, a risk that is independent of brain lesions on MRI.", "output": "Asymptomatic spinal cord lesions predict disease progression in radiologically isolated syndrome.", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

By transducing cortical neurons with genes that were expressed more highly in granule cell neurons, we identified three interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs; Ifi27, Irg1 and Rsad2 (also known as Viperin)) that mediated the antiviral effects against different neurotropic viruses. Moreover, we found that the epigenetic state and microRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulation of ISGs correlates with enhanced antiviral response in granule cell neurons.

The respective members function as large protein complexes involved in establishment and maintenance of transcriptional repression of developmental control genes. MBTD1, Malignant Brain Tumor domain-containing protein 1, is one such PcG protein. MBTD1 contains four MBT repeats.   \n METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We have determined the crystal structure of MBTD1 (residues 130-566aa covering the 4 MBT repeats) at 2.5 A resolution by X-ray crystallography. The crystal structure of MBTD1 reveals its similarity to another four-MBT-repeat protein L3MBTL2, which binds lower methylated lysine histones. Fluorescence polarization experiments confirmed that MBTD1 preferentially binds mono- and di-methyllysine histone peptides, like L3MBTL1 and L3MBTL2. All known MBT-peptide complex structures characterized to date do not exhibit strong histone peptide sequence selectivity, and use a \"cavity insertion recognition mode\" to recognize the methylated lysine with the deeply buried methyl-lysine forming extensive interactions with the protein while the peptide residues flanking methyl-lysine forming very few contacts [1]. Nevertheless, our mutagenesis data based on L3MBTL1 suggested that the histone peptides could not bind to MBT repeats in any orientation.   \n CONCLUSIONS The four MBT repeats in MBTD1 exhibits an asymmetric rhomboid architecture. Like other MBT repeat proteins characterized so far, MBTD1 binds mono- or dimethylated lysine histones through one of its four MBT repeats utilizing a semi-aromatic cage.

However, findings on the association between obesity/overweight and ADHD are mixed. The authors conducted a meta-analysis to estimate this association.   \n METHOD A broad range of databases was searched through Aug. 31, 2014. Unpublished studies were also obtained. Study quality was rated with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Random-effects models were used.   \n RESULTS Forty-two studies that included a total of 728,136 individuals (48,161 ADHD subjects; 679,975 comparison subjects) were retained. A significant association between obesity and ADHD was found for both children (odds ratio=1.20, 95% CI=1.05-1.37) and adults (odds ratio=1.55, 95% CI=1.32-1.81). The pooled prevalence of obesity was increased by about 70% in adults with ADHD (28.2%, 95% CI=22.8-34.4) compared with those without ADHD (16.4%, 95% CI=13.4-19.9), and by about 40% in children with ADHD (10.3%, 95% CI=7.9-13.3) compared with those without ADHD (7.4%, 95% CI=5.4-10.1). The significant association between ADHD and obesity remained when limited to studies 1) reporting odds ratios adjusted for possible confounding factors; 2) diagnosing ADHD by direct interview; and 3) using directly measured height and weight. Gender, study setting, study country, and study quality did not moderate the association between obesity and ADHD. ADHD was also significantly associated with overweight. Individuals medicated for ADHD were not at higher risk of obesity.   \n CONCLUSIONS This study provides meta-analytic evidence for a significant association between ADHD and obesity/overweight.

To address this, we have studied the expression of Na(V)1.5 and other Na+ channel isoforms in the AVN.   \n METHODS AND RESULTS The rat AVN was identified by Masson's trichrome staining together with immunolabeling of marker proteins: connexin40, connexin43, desmoplakin, atrial natriuretic peptide, and hyperpolarization-activated and cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 4. Na+ channel expression was investigated with immunohistochemistry with isoform-specific Na+ channel antibodies. Na(V)1.1 was distributed in a similar manner to Na(V)1.5. Na(V)1.2 was not detected. Na(V)1.3 labeling was present in nerve fibers and cell bodies (but not myocytes) and was abundant in the penetrating atrioventricular (AV) bundle and the common bundle but was much less abundant in other regions. Na(V)1.5 labeling was abundant in the atrial and ventricular myocardium and the left bundle branch. Na(V)1.5 labeling was absent in the open node, penetrating AV bundle, AV ring bundle, and common bundle but present at a reduced level in the inferior nodal extension and transitional zone. Na(V)1.6 was not detected.   \n CONCLUSIONS Our findings provide molecular evidence of multiple electrophysiological cell types at the AV junction.

In this study, we describe neutrophils responding uniquely to Staphylococcus aureus via a novel process of NET formation that did not require neutrophil lysis or even breach of the plasma membrane. The multilobular nucleus rapidly became rounded and condensed. During this process, we observed the separation of the inner and outer nuclear membranes and budding of vesicles, and the separated membranes and vesicles were filled with nuclear DNA. The vesicles were extruded intact into the extracellular space where they ruptured, and the chromatin was released. This entire process occurred via a unique, very rapid (5-60 min), oxidant-independent mechanism. Mitochondrial DNA constituted very little if any of these NETs. They did have a limited amount of proteolytic activity and were able to kill S. aureus. With time, the nuclear envelope ruptured, and DNA filled the cytoplasm presumably for later lytic NET production, but this was distinct from the vesicular release mechanism. Panton-Valentine leukocidin, autolysin, and a lipase were identified in supernatants with NET-inducing activity, but Panton-Valentine leukocidin was the dominant NET inducer.

MS is considered a T-cell-mediated disease, but until now the study of pathogenic T cells has encountered major challenges, most importantly the limited access of brain-infiltrating T cells.

High-quality studies were considered those that described an appropriate method of randomization, allocation concealment, blinding, and completeness of follow-up.   \n MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Random-effects Mantel-Haenszel risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs were derived for composite cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, and individual cardiovascular events.

We compare the relative probabilities of these models and the appropriateness of a molecular clock using Bayes factors. Our most general model, first proposed by Tamura and Nei, parameterizes the infinitesimal change probabilities among nucleotides (A, G, C, T/U) into six parameters, consisting of three parameters for the nucleotide stationary distribution, two rate parameters for nucleotide transitions, and another parameter for nucleotide transversions.

We compare CIMT and ABPI with atheroma burden as measured by whole body magnetic resonance angiography (WB-MRA).   \n METHODS 50 patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease were recruited. CIMT was measured using ultrasound while rest and exercise ABPI were performed. WB-MRA was performed in a 1.5T MRI scanner using 4 volume acquisitions with a divided dose of intravenous gadolinium gadoterate meglumine (Dotarem, Guerbet, FR). The WB-MRA data was divided into 31 anatomical arterial segments with each scored according to degree of luminal narrowing: 0 = normal, 1 = <50%, 2 = 50-70%, 3 = 70-99%, 4 = vessel occlusion. The segment scores were summed and from this a standardized atheroma score was calculated.   \n RESULTS The atherosclerotic burden was high with a standardised atheroma score of 39.5\u00b111. Common CIMT showed a positive correlation with the whole body atheroma score (\u03b2 0.32, p = 0.045), however this was due to its strong correlation with the neck and thoracic segments (\u03b2 0.42 p = 0.01) with no correlation with the rest of the body. ABPI correlated with the whole body atheroma score (\u03b2 -0.39, p = 0.012), which was due to a strong correlation with the ilio-femoral vessels with no correlation with the thoracic or neck vessels. On multiple linear regression, no correlation between CIMT and global atheroma burden was present (\u03b2 0.13 p = 0.45), while the correlation between ABPI and atheroma burden persisted (\u03b2 -0.45 p = 0.005).   \n CONCLUSION ABPI but not CIMT correlates with global atheroma burden as measured by whole body contrast enhanced magnetic resonance angiography in a population with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease.

It contains two copies each of the four core histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 and about 147 bp of DNA. The residues of the histone proteins are subject to numerous post-translational modifications, such as methylation or acetylation. Chromatin immunoprecipitiation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) is a technique that provides genome-wide occupancy data of these modified histone proteins, and it requires appropriate computational methods.   \n RESULTS We present NucHunter, an algorithm that uses the data from ChIP-seq experiments directed against many histone modifications to infer positioned nucleosomes. NucHunter annotates each of these nucleosomes with the intensities of the histone modifications. We demonstrate that these annotations can be used to infer nucleosomal states with distinct correlations to underlying genomic features and chromatin-related processes, such as transcriptional start sites, enhancers, elongation by RNA polymerase II and chromatin-mediated repression. Thus, NucHunter is a versatile tool that can be used to predict positioned nucleosomes from a panel of histone modification ChIP-seq experiments and infer distinct histone modification patterns associated to different chromatin states.

We measured fasting IGF-I, IGF-II, IGF binding protein (IGFBP)-1, IGFBP-3, and acid-labile subunit levels in a subset of 33 MC4R-deficient patients and 36 control subjects. We examined pulsatile GH secretion in six adult MC4R-deficient subjects and six obese controls.   \n RESULTS Height sd score was significantly greater in MC4R-deficient children under 5 yr of age compared with controls (mean \u00b1 SEM: 2.3 \u00b1 0.06 vs. 1.8 \u00b1 0.04, P < 0.001), an effect that persisted throughout childhood. Final height (cm) was greater in MC4R-deficient men (mean \u00b1 SEM 173 \u00b1 2.5 vs. 168 \u00b1 2.1, P < 0.001) and women (mean 165 \u00b1 2.1 vs. 158 \u00b1 1.9, P < 0.001). Fasting IGF-I, IGF-II, acid-labile subunit, and IGFBP-3 concentrations were similar in the two groups. GH levels were markedly suppressed in obese controls, but pulsatile GH secretion was retained in MC4R deficiency. The mean maximal GH secretion rate per burst (P < 0.05) and mass per burst (P < 0.05) were increased in MC4R deficiency, consistent with increased pulsatile and total GH secretion. Fasting insulin levels were markedly elevated in MC4R-deficient children.   \n CONCLUSIONS In MC4R deficiency, increased linear growth in childhood leads to increased adult final height, greater than predicted by obesity alone. GH pulsatility is maintained in MC4R deficiency, a finding consistent with animal studies, suggesting a role for MC4R in controlling hypothalamic somatostatinergic tone.

Their combination might be more effective than either treatment alone, but long-term data for comparative changes in renal function are not available. We investigated the renal effects of ramipril (an ACE inhibitor), telmisartan (an ARB), and their combination in patients aged 55 years or older with established atherosclerotic vascular disease or with diabetes with end-organ damage.   \n METHODS The trial ran from 2001 to 2007. After a 3-week run-in period, 25 620 participants were randomly assigned to ramipril 10 mg a day (n=8576), telmisartan 80 mg a day (n=8542), or to a combination of both drugs (n=8502; median follow-up was 56 months), and renal function and proteinuria were measured. The primary renal outcome was a composite of dialysis, doubling of serum creatinine, and death. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00153101.   \n FINDINGS 784 patients permanently discontinued randomised therapy during the trial because of hypotensive symptoms (406 on combination therapy, 149 on ramipril, and 229 on telmisartan). The number of events for the composite primary outcome was similar for telmisartan (n=1147 [13.4%]) and ramipril (1150 [13.5%]; hazard ratio [HR] 1.00, 95% CI 0.92-1.09), but was increased with combination therapy (1233 [14.5%]; HR 1.09, 1.01-1.18, p=0.037). The secondary renal outcome, dialysis or doubling of serum creatinine, was similar with telmisartan (189 [2.21%]) and ramipril (174 [2.03%]; HR 1.09, 0.89-1.34) and more frequent with combination therapy (212 [2.49%]: HR 1.24, 1.01-1.51, p=0.038).

These trials provide an opportunity for investigating the correlation between bone metabolism and clinical outcome during bisphosphonate therapy.   \n PATIENTS AND METHODS Urinary measurements of N-telopeptide (Ntx) and serum bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP) were obtained in 1,824 bisphosphonate-treated patients-1,462 with zoledronic acid (breast, 490; prostate, 411; myeloma, 210; non-small-cell lung, 183; other, 168) and 362 with pamidronate (breast, 254; myeloma, 108). This exploratory cohort analysis grouped patients by baseline and most recent levels of Ntx as low (< 50 nmol/mmol creatinine), moderate (50 to 99 nmol/mmol creatinine), or high (> or = 100 nmol/mmol creatinine), and BAP as low (< 146 U/L) or high (> or = 146 U/L). The relative risks for negative clinical outcomes were estimated for each group using multiple-event and Cox regression models with time-varying covariates.   \n RESULTS Patients with high and moderate Ntx levels had 2-fold increases in their risk of skeletal complications and disease progression compared with patients with low Ntx levels (P < .001 for all). High Ntx levels in each solid tumor category were associated with a 4- to 6-fold increased risk of death on study, and moderate Ntx levels a 2- to 4-fold increased risk compared with low Ntx levels (P < .001 for all).

Alterations in pre- and postsynaptic components of GABAergic neurotransmission were investigated immunohistochemically at different time points (1-120 days) in this mouse model of MTLE. Markers of GABAergic interneurons (parvalbumin, calbindin-D28k, and calretinin), the type-1 GABA transporter (GAT1), and major GABA(A)-receptor subunits expressed in the hippocampal formation were analyzed. Acutely, KA injection produced a profound loss of hilar cells but only limited damage to CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells. In addition, parvalbumin and calbindin-D28k staining of interneurons disappeared irreversibly in CA1 and dentate gyrus (DG), whereas calretinin staining was spared. The prominent GABA(A)-receptor alpha1 subunit staining of interneurons also disappeared after KA treatment, suggesting acute degeneration of these cells. Likewise, GAT1 immunoreactivity revealed degenerating terminals at 24 h post-KA in CA1 and DC and subsided almost completely thereafter. Loss of CA1 and, to a lesser extent, CA3 neurons became evident at 7-15 days post-KA. It was more accentuated after 1 month, accompanied by a corresponding reduction of GABA(A)-receptor staining. In contrast, DC granule cells were markedly enlarged and dispersed in the molecular layer and exhibited a prominent increase in GABA(A)-receptor subunit staining. After 4 months, the dorsal CA1 area was lost almost entirely, CA3 was reduced, and the DG represented most of the remaining dorsal hippocampal formation. No significant morphological alterations were detected contralaterally. These results suggest that loss of hilar cells and GABAergic neurons contributes to epileptogenesis in this model of MTLE. In contrast, long-term degeneration of pyramidal cells and granule cell dispersion may reflect distinct responses to recurrent seizures. Finally, GABA(A)-receptor upregulation in the DG may represent a compensatory response persisting for several months in epileptic mice.", "output": "Early loss of interneurons and delayed subunit-specific changes in GABA(A)-receptor expression in a mouse model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

The dietary patterns were assessed by hierarchical linear regression including country, age, sex, national income, and time as exploratory variables.   \n FINDINGS From 1990 to 2010, diets based on healthy items improved globally (by 2\u00b72 points, 95% uncertainty interval (UI) 0\u00b79 to 3\u00b75), whereas diets based on unhealthy items worsened (-2\u00b75, -3\u00b73 to -1\u00b77). In 2010, the global mean scores were 44\u00b70 (SD 10\u00b75) for the healthy pattern and 52\u00b71 (18\u00b76) for the unhealthy pattern, with weak intercorrelation (r=-0\u00b708) between countries. On average, better diets were seen in older adults compared with younger adults, and in women compared with men (p<0\u00b70001 each). Compared with low-income nations, high-income nations had better diets based on healthy items (+2\u00b75 points, 95% UI 0\u00b73 to 4\u00b71), but substantially poorer diets based on unhealthy items (-33\u00b70, -37\u00b78 to -28\u00b73). Diets and their trends were very heterogeneous across the world regions. For example, both types of dietary patterns improved in high-income countries, but worsened in some low-income countries in Africa and Asia. Middle-income countries showed the largest improvement in dietary patterns based on healthy items, but the largest deterioration in dietary patterns based on unhealthy items.   \n INTERPRETATION Consumption of healthy items improved, while consumption of unhealthy items worsened across the world, with heterogeneity across regions and countries.

Androgens can drive this process by direct action on the stroma. We investigated whether there was a direct link between androgens and another key regulator of stromal cells, intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+ ]i ).   \n METHODS Prostate stromal cells were freshly obtained and cultures derived from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Gene expression in dihydrotestosterone treated and untreated cells was compared using Affymetrix gene expression arrays and Ca2+ regulated features were identified by Gene Ontology (GO). Changes in [Ca2+]i were determined in Fluo-4 loaded cells. Androgen regulation was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitaion.   \n RESULTS Stromal cell cultures were sorted for expression of integrin \u03b11 \u03b21 , which enriched for cells expressing the androgen receptor (AR). We identified key functional categories, within the androgen-induced gene expression signature, focusing on genes involved in calcium signaling. From this analysis, stromal interaction molecule-1 (STIM1) was identified as a significantly differentially expressed gene with four relevant associated GO terms. DNA sequence analysis showed that the promoter region of STIM1 contained putative androgen response element sequences in which AR binding ability of STIM1 was confirmed. Androgens directly regulated STIM1 expression and STIM1 effects on store-operated calcium entry were inhibited by STIM1 knock-down. Reduced STIM1 expression in prostate stromal cells led to a reduction in basal Ca2+ levels, the amount of Ca2+ released by thapsigargin and a reduction in store filling following TG-induced store depletion.   \n CONCLUSIONS These results indicate that androgens modulate [Ca2+]i through the direct regulation of the STIM1 gene by AR binding to the STIM1 promoter.", "output": "The calcium sensor STIM1 is regulated by androgens in prostate stromal cells.", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

Primary end point was overall survival (OS). Response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS) and safety were secondary end points.   \n RESULTS Accrual was stopped after randomization of 171 patients based on the results of a futility OS analysis. A total of 155 patients died and 16 were still alive [median follow-up 1.6 years (range 0.25-6 years)]. HIA did not improve OS (median 14.6 months) when compared with the IV arm (median 13.8 months), hazard ratio (HR) 1.09; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79-1.50, log-rank P = 0.59. However, there was a significant benefit on PFS for HIA compared with IV with a median of 4.5 versus 3.5 months, respectively (HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.45-0.84, log-rank P = 0.002). The 1-year PFS rate was 24% in the HIA arm versus 8% in the IV arm. An improved RR was seen in the HIA (10.5%) compared with IV treatment (2.4%). In the IV arm, the most frequent grade \u22653 toxicity was thrombocytopenia (42.1%) and neutropenia (62.6%), compared with 21.2% and 28.7% in the HIA arm. The main grade \u22653 toxicity related to HIA was catheter complications (12%) and liver toxicity (4.5%) apart from two toxic deaths.   \n CONCLUSION HIA treatment with fotemustine did not translate into an improved OS compared with IV treatment, despite better RR and PFS.

Egyptians believed that cancer occurred at the will of the gods. Hippocrates believed human disease resulted from an imbalance of the four humors: blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile with cancer being caused by excess black bile. The lymph theory of cancer replaced the humoral theory and the blastema theory replaced the lymph theory. Rudolph Virchow was the first to recognize that cancer cells like all cells came from other cells and believed chronic irritation caused cancer. At the same time there was a belief that trauma caused cancer, though it never evolved after many experiments inducing trauma. The birth of virology occurred in 1892 when Dimitri Ivanofsky demonstrated that diseased tobacco plants remained infective after filtering their sap through a filter that trapped bacteria. Martinus Beijerinck would call the tiny infective agent a virus and both Dimitri Ivanofsky and Marinus Beijerinck would become the fathers of virology. Not to long thereafter, Payton Rous founded the field of tumor virology in 1911 with his discovery of a transmittable sarcoma of chickens by what would come to be called Rous sarcoma virus or RSV for short. The first identified human tumor virus was the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), named after Tony Epstein and Yvonne Barr who visualized the virus particles in Burkitt's lymphoma cells by electron microscopy in 1965. Since that time, many viruses have been associated with carcinogenesis including the most studied, human papilloma virus associated with cervical carcinoma, many other anogenital carcinomas, and oropharyngeal carcinoma.

We sought to estimate the potential health effects of such a fiscal strategy in the middle-income country of India, where there is heterogeneity in SSB consumption, patterns of substitution between SSBs and other beverages after tax increases, and vast differences in chronic disease risk within the population.   \n METHODS AND FINDINGS Using consumption and price variations data from a nationally representative survey of 100,855 Indian households, we first calculated how changes in SSB price alter per capita consumption of SSBs and substitution with other beverages. We then incorporated SSB sales trends, body mass index (BMI), and diabetes incidence data stratified by age, sex, income, and urban/rural residence into a validated microsimulation of caloric consumption, glycemic load, overweight/obesity prevalence, and type 2 diabetes incidence among Indian subpopulations facing a 20% SSB excise tax. The 20% SSB tax was anticipated to reduce overweight and obesity prevalence by 3.0% (95% CI 1.6%-5.9%) and type 2 diabetes incidence by 1.6% (95% CI 1.2%-1.9%) among various Indian subpopulations over the period 2014-2023, if SSB consumption continued to increase linearly in accordance with secular trends. However, acceleration in SSB consumption trends consistent with industry marketing models would be expected to increase the impact efficacy of taxation, averting 4.2% of prevalent overweight/obesity (95% CI 2.5-10.0%) and 2.5% (95% CI 1.0-2.8%) of incident type 2 diabetes from 2014-2023. Given current consumption and BMI distributions, our results suggest the largest relative effect would be expected among young rural men, refuting our a priori hypothesis that urban populations would be isolated beneficiaries of SSB taxation. Key limitations of this estimation approach include the assumption that consumer expenditure behavior from prior years, captured in price elasticities, will reflect future behavior among consumers, and potential underreporting of consumption in dietary recall data used to inform our calculations.   \n CONCLUSION Sustained SSB taxation at a high tax rate could mitigate rising obesity and type 2 diabetes in India among both urban and rural subpopulations.", "output": "Averting Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes in India through Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Taxation: An Economic-Epidemiologic Modeling Study", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

Spt5 and its bacterial homologue NusG regulate gene expression in several ways by (i) modulating transcription processivity and promoter proximal pausing, (ii) coupling transcription and RNA processing or translation, and (iii) recruiting termination factors and thereby silencing laterally transferred DNA and protecting the genome against double-stranded DNA breaks. This review discusses recent discoveries that identify Spt5-like factors as evolutionary conserved nexus for the regulation and coordination of the machineries responsible for information processing in the cell.", "output": "A Nexus for Gene Expression\u2014Molecular Mechanisms of Spt5 and NusG in the Three Domains of Life", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

A relationship between long-term exposure to endogenous estrogens and incident dementia has been hypothesized but not studied.   \n OBJECTIVE To determine whether a longer reproductive period, as an indicator of longer exposure to endogenous estrogens, is associated with lower risk of dementia and Alzheimer disease (AD) in women who have natural menopause.   \n DESIGN AND SETTING The Rotterdam Study, a population-based prospective cohort study conducted in the Netherlands.   \n PARTICIPANTS A total of 3601 women aged 55 years or older who did not have dementia at baseline (1990-1993) and had information on age at menarche, age at menopause, and type of menopause. Participants were reexamined in 1993-1994 and 1997-1999 and were continuously monitored for development of dementia.   \n MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Incidence of dementia, based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition criteria, and AD, based on National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria, compared by quartiles of reproductive period among women with natural menopause.   \n RESULTS During 21 046 person-years of follow-up (median follow-up, 6.3 years), 199 women developed dementia, including 159 who developed AD. After adjusting for age, dementia was not clearly associated with length of reproductive period. However, after adjusting for multiple covariates, women with natural menopause and more reproductive years had an increased risk of dementia (adjusted rate ratio [RR] for women with >39 reproductive years [highest quartile] compared with <34 reproductive years [lowest quartile], 1.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-2.84). The adjusted RR per year of increase was 1.04 (95% CI, 1.01-1.08). For risk of AD, the adjusted RRs were 1.51 (95% CI, 0.91-2.50) and 1.03 (95% CI, 1.00-1.07), respectively. Risk of dementia associated with a longer reproductive period was most pronounced in APOE epsilon4 carriers (adjusted RR for >39 reproductive years compared with <34 reproductive years, 4.20 [95% CI, 1.97-8.92] for dementia and 3.42 [95% CI, 1.51-7.75] for AD), whereas in noncarriers, no clear association with dementia or AD was observed.   \n CONCLUSION Our findings do not support the hypothesis that a longer reproductive period reduces risk of dementia in women who have natural menopause.", "output": "Reproductive period and risk of dementia in postmenopausal women.", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

As MAAs are derived from self, immune responses to these may be limited by thymic tolerance. The extent to which self-tolerance prevents efficient immune responses to MAAs remains unknown. The autoimmune regulator (AIRE) controls the expression of tissue-specific self-antigens in thymic epithelial cells (TECs). The level of antigens expressed in the TECs determines the fate of auto-reactive thymocytes. Deficiency in AIRE leads in both humans (APECED patients) and mice to enlarged autoreactive immune repertoires. Here we show increased IgG levels to melanoma cells in APECED patients correlating with autoimmune skin features. Similarly, the enlarged T cell repertoire in AIRE(-/-) mice enables them to mount anti-MAA and anti-melanoma responses as shown by increased anti-melanoma antibodies, and enhanced CD4(+) and MAA-specific CD8(+) T cell responses after melanoma challenge. We show that thymic expression of gp100 is under the control of AIRE, leading to increased gp100-specific CD8(+) T cell frequencies in AIRE(-/-) mice.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA Hypoalbuminemia is associated with poor outcomes in acutely ill patients, but whether this association is causal has remained unclear. Trials investigating albumin therapy to correct hypoalbuminemia have proven inconclusive.   \n METHODS A meta-analysis was conducted of 90 cohort studies with 291,433 total patients evaluating hypoalbuminemia as an outcome predictor by multivariate analysis and, separately, of nine prospective controlled trials with 535 total patients on correcting hypoalbuminemia.   \n RESULTS Hypoalbuminemia was a potent, dose-dependent independent predictor of poor outcome. Each 10-g/L decline in serum albumin concentration significantly raised the odds of mortality by 137%, morbidity by 89%, prolonged intensive care unit and hospital stay respectively by 28% and 71%, and increased resource utilization by 66%. The association between hypoalbuminemia and poor outcome appeared to be independent of both nutritional status and inflammation. Analysis of dose-dependency in controlled trials of albumin therapy suggested that complication rates may be reduced when the serum albumin level attained during albumin administration exceeds 30 g/L.

To address whether enhancing circadian rhythmicity in tumor cells affects cell cycle progression and reduces proliferation, we compared growth and cell cycle events of B16 melanoma cells and tumors with either a functional or dysfunctional clock.   \n RESULTS We found that clock genes were suppressed in B16 cells and tumors, but treatments inducing circadian rhythmicity, such as dexamethasone, forskolin and heat shock, triggered rhythmic clock and cell cycle gene expression, which resulted in fewer cells in S phase and more in G1 phase. Accordingly, B16 proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo was slowed down. Similar effects were observed in human colon carcinoma HCT-116 cells. Notably, the effects of dexamethasone were not due to an increase in apoptosis nor to an enhancement of immune cell recruitment to the tumor. Knocking down the essential clock gene Bmal1 in B16 tumors prevented the effects of dexamethasone on tumor growth and cell cycle events.   \n CONCLUSIONS Here we demonstrated that the effects of dexamethasone on cell cycle and tumor growth are mediated by the tumor-intrinsic circadian clock.

The median age of the patients was 68 years (range: 31-87 years). We compared various hematological indices between the NSCLC group and an age- and sex-matched comparator group. MPV was significantly decreased in the NSCLC group compared to the comparator group. In contrast, the PC was significantly increased in the NSCLC group. Consequently, the MPV/PC ratio was also decreased in the NSCLC group (0.397 vs. 0.501).

A large number of CREB, CREM, and ATF-1 proteins are generated by posttranscriptional events, mostly alternative splicing, and regulate gene expression by acting as activators or repressors. Activation is classically brought about by signaling-dependent phosphorylation of a key acceptor site (Ser133 in CREB) by a number of possible kinases, including PKA, CamKIV, and Rsk-2. Phosphorylation is the prerequisite for the interaction of CBP (CREB-binding protein), a co-activator that has also histone acetyltransferase activity. Repression may involve dynamic dephosphorylation of the activators and thus decreased association with CBP. Another pathway of transcriptional repression on CRE sites implicates the inducible repressor ICER (inducible cAMP early repressor), a product of the CREM gene. Being an inducible repressor, ICER is involved in autoregulatory feedback loops of transcription that govern the down-regulation of early response genes, such as the proto-oncogene c-fos. The liver represents a remarkable physiological setting where cAMP-responsive signaling plays a major role. Indeed, a finely tuned program of gene expression is triggered by partial hepatectomy, so that through specific checkpoints a coordinated regeneration of the tissue is obtained. Temporal kinetics of transcriptional activation after hepatectomy reveals a pattern of early induction for several genes, some of them controlled by the CREB/CREM transcription factors. An important role of CREM in liver physiology was suggested by the robust induction of ICER after partial hepatectomy. The delay in tissue regeneration in CREM-deficient mice confirmed the important function of this factor in regulating hepatocyte proliferation.

Cytokines present during untreated HIV-1 infection, most prominently IL-15, triggered proliferation and expression of activation markers in CD8(+) T cells, but not CD4(+) T cells, in the absence of TCR stimulation. Moreover, LPS or HIV-1-activated dendritic cells (DCs) stimulated CD8(+) T cells in an IL-15-dependent but Ag-independent manner, and IL-15 expression was highly increased in DCs isolated from viremic HIV-1 patients, suggesting that CD8(+) T cells are activated by inflammatory cytokines in untreated HIV-1 patients independent of Ag specificity.

The most important natural cannabinoid is the psychoactive tetrahydrocannabinol (\u03949-THC); others include cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabigerol (CBG). Not all the observed effects can be ascribed to THC, and the other constituents may also modulate its action; for example CBD reduces anxiety induced by THC. A standardised extract of the herb may be therefore be more beneficial in practice and clinical trial protocols have been drawn up to assess this. The mechanism of action is still not fully understood, although cannabinoid receptors have been cloned and natural ligands identified. Cannabis is frequently used by patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) for muscle spasm and pain, and in an experimental model of MS low doses of cannabinoids alleviated tremor. Most of the controlled studies have been carried out with THC rather than cannabis herb and so do not mimic the usual clincal situation. Small clinical studies have confirmed the usefulness of THC as an analgesic; CBD and CBG also have analgesic and antiinflammatory effects, indicating that there is scope for developing drugs which do not have the psychoactive properties ofTHC. Patients taking the synthetic derivative nabilone for neurogenic pain actually preferred cannabis herb and reported that it relieved not only pain but the associated depression and anxiety. Cannabinoids are effective in chemotherapy-induced emesis and nabilone has been licensed for this use for several years. Currently, the synthetic cannabinoid HU211 is undergoing trials as a protective agent after brain trauma. Anecdotal reports of cannabis use include case studies in migraine and Tourette\u2019s syndrome, and as a treatment for asthma and glaucoma. Apart from the smoking aspect, the safety profile of cannabis is fairly good. However, adverse reactions include panic or anxiety attacks, which are worse in the elderly and in women, and less likely in children. Although psychosis has been cited as a consequence of cannabis use, an examination of psychiatric hospital admissions found no evidence of this, however, it may exacerbate existing symptoms. The relatively slow elimination from the body of the cannabinoids has safety implications for cognitive tasks, especially driving and operating machinery; although driving impairment with cannabis is only moderate, there is a significant interaction with alcohol.

A subset of schools that entered comprehensive information in CurrMIT was searched for a specified list of women's health topics and or gender-specific content on any topic. Statistical analyses were performed to assess the relationship between frequency of topics and school characteristics.   \n RESULTS The authors identified 95 schools that entered related courses/clerkships. Ten courses/clerkships at nine schools met criteria for an interdisciplinary women's health course/clerkship.

This activation potentiates not only cell survival and proliferation, but also cytoskeletal deformability and motility; key elements in tumor invasion. In addition the PI3K pathway is implicated in many aspects of angiogenesis, including upregulation of angiogenic cytokines due to tumor hypoxia or oncogene activation and endothelial cell responses to them. These cytokines signal though receptors such as VEGF-R, FGF-R and Tie-2 and potentiate processes essential for neoangiogenesis including cell proliferation, migration, differentiation into tubules and \"invasion\" of these capillary sprouts into extracellular matrix (ECM).   \n CONCLUSIONS A more complete understanding of the role of the PI3 kinase pathway in cancer will lead the way to the development of more potent and selective inhibitors which should be a useful adjunct to conventional therapies, potentially interfering with tumor progression at several pivotal points; in particular cell survival, invasion and angiogenesis.", "output": "Phosphoinositide 3-kinase signalling pathways in tumor progression, invasion and angiogenesis.", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

Evidence is accumulating that vesicles are cargo containers used by eukaryotic cells to exchange biomolecules as transmembrane receptors and genetic information. Because also bacteria communicate to each other via extracellular vesicles, the intercellular communication via extracellular cargo carriers seems to be conserved throughout evolution, and therefore vesicles are likely to be a highly efficient, robust, and economic manner of exchanging information between cells. Furthermore, vesicles protect cells from accumulation of waste or drugs, they contribute to physiology and pathology, and they have a myriad of potential clinical applications, ranging from biomarkers to anticancer therapy.

Early closure of the ductus arteriosus may be achieved pharmacologically using cyclooxygenase inhibitors or by surgery. The efficacy of both treatment modalities is well established. However, the preferred initial treatment of a symptomatic PDA in a preterm infant, surgical ligation or treatment with indomethacin, has not been well established.   \n OBJECTIVES To compare the effect of surgical ligation of PDA vs. medical treatment with cyclooxygenase inhibitors (using indomethacin, ibuprofen, or mefenamic acid), each used as the initial treatment, on neonatal mortality in preterm infants with a symptomatic PDA.    SEARCH STRATEGY The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. This included search of electronic databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 - July 2007), CINAHL (1982 - July 2007), EMBASE (1980 - July 2007); and hand search of abstracts of Pediatric Academic Societies annual meetings published in Pediatric Research (1990 - April 2002) or on line from May 2002 -July 2007. No language restrictions were applied.    SELECTION CRITERIA All trials 1) using randomized or quasi-randomized patient allocation, 2) in preterm infants < 37 weeks gestational age or low-birth-weight infants (< 2500 grams) with symptomatic PDA in the neonatal period (< 28 days) and 3) comparing surgical ligation with medical treatment with cyclooxygenase inhibitors, each used as the initial treatment for closure of PDA.   \n DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Assessment of methodological quality and extraction of data for included trials was undertaken independently by the authors. RevMan 4.1 was used for analysis of the data.   \n MAIN RESULTS Only one study, trial B in the report of Gersony 1983, was found eligible. No additional studies were identified in the literature searches performed in July 2007.

No trials comparing surgery to other cyclooxygenase inhibitors (ibuprofen, mefenamic acid) were found. Trial B of Gersony 1983 enrolled 154 infants. The study found no statistically significant difference between surgical closure and indomethacin treatment in mortality during hospital stay, chronic lung disease, other bleeding, necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, creatinine level, or intraventricular hemorrhage.

AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS The data regarding net benefit/harm are insufficient to make a conclusion as to whether surgical ligation or medical treatment with indomethacin is preferred as initial treatment for symptomatic PDA in preterm infants.

However, the neural substrate that underlies this improved performance remains to be fully understood. An earlier behavioral study demonstrated that some early-blind people localize sounds more accurately than sighted controls using monaural cues. In order to investigate the neural basis of these behavioral differences in humans, we carried out functional imaging studies using positron emission tomography and a speaker array that permitted pseudo-free-field presentations within the scanner. During binaural sound localization, a sighted control group showed decreased cerebral blood flow in the occipital lobe, which was not seen in early-blind individuals. During monaural sound localization (one ear plugged), the subgroup of early-blind subjects who were behaviorally superior at sound localization displayed two activation foci in the occipital cortex. This effect was not seen in blind persons who did not have superior monaural sound localization abilities, nor in sighted individuals. The degree of activation of one of these foci was strongly correlated with sound localization accuracy across the entire group of blind subjects. The results show that those blind persons who perform better than sighted persons recruit occipital areas to carry out auditory localization under monaural conditions. We therefore conclude that computations carried out in the occipital cortex specifically underlie the enhanced capacity to use monaural cues. Our findings shed light not only on intermodal compensatory mechanisms, but also on individual differences in these mechanisms and on inhibitory patterns that differ between sighted individuals and those deprived of vision early in life.", "output": "A Functional Neuroimaging Study of Sound Localization: Visual Cortex Activity Predicts Performance in Early-Blind Individuals", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

Treatment with XL147 resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth and levels of pAKT and pS6, signal transducers in the PI3K/AKT/TOR pathway. In HER2-overexpressing cells, inhibition of PI3K was followed by up-regulation of expression and phosphorylation of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, including HER3. Knockdown of FoxO1 and FoxO3a transcription factors suppressed the induction of HER3, InsR, IGF1R, and FGFR2 mRNAs upon inhibition of PI3K. In HER2(+) cells, knockdown of HER3 with siRNA or cotreatment with the HER2 inhibitors trastuzumab or lapatinib enhanced XL147-induced cell death and inhibition of pAKT and pS6. Trastuzumab and lapatinib each synergized with XL147 for inhibition of pAKT and growth of established BT474 xenografts. These data suggest that PI3K antagonists will inhibit AKT and relieve suppression of receptor tyrosine kinase expression and their activity.

We aimed to assess the effect of umbilical-cord cleansing with 4% chlorhexidine (CHX) solution, with or without handwashing with antiseptic soap, on the incidence of omphalitis and neonatal mortality.   \n METHODS We did a two-by-two factorial, cluster-randomised trial in Dadu, a rural area of Sindh province, Pakistan. Clusters were defined as the population covered by a functional traditional birth attendant (TBA), and were randomly allocated to one of four groups (groups A to D) with a computer-generated random number sequence. Implementation and data collection teams were masked to allocation. Liveborn infants delivered by participating TBAs who received birth kits were eligible for enrolment in the study. One intervention comprised birth kits containing 4% CHX solution for application to the cord at birth by TBAs and once daily by family members for up to 14 days along with soap and educational messages promoting handwashing. One intervention was CHX solution only and another was handwashing only. Standard dry cord care was promoted in the control group. The primary outcomes were incidence of neonatal omphalitis and neonatal mortality. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00682006.   \n FINDINGS 187 clusters were randomly allocated to one of the four study groups. Of 9741 newborn babies delivered by participating TBAs, factorial analysis indicated a reduction in risk of omphalitis with CHX application (risk ratio [RR]=0\u00b758, 95% CI 0\u00b741-0\u00b782; p=0\u00b7002) but no evidence of an effect of handwashing (RR=0\u00b783, 0\u00b761-1\u00b713; p=0\u00b724). We recorded strong evidence of a reduction in neonatal mortality in neonates who received CHX cleansing (RR=0\u00b762, 95 % CI 0\u00b745-0\u00b785; p=0\u00b7003) but no evidence of an effect of handwashing promotion on neonatal mortality (RR=1\u00b708, 0\u00b779-1\u00b748; p=0\u00b762). We recorded no serious adverse events.   \n INTERPRETATION Application of 4% CHX to the umbilical cord was effective in reducing the risk of omphalitis and neonatal mortality in rural Pakistan.

These clinically important manifestations have stimulated interest in defining the sequence variation in the ATM gene. Therefore, we undertook a comprehensive survey of sequence variation in ATM in diverse human populations. The protein-encoding exons of the gene (9,168 bp) and the adjacent intron and untranslated sequences (14,661 bp) were analyzed in 93 individuals from seven major human populations. In addition, the coding sequence was analyzed in one chimpanzee, one gorilla, one orangutan, and one Old World monkey. In human ATM, 88 variant sites were discovered by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography, which is 96%-100% sensitive for detection of DNA sequence variation. ATM was compared to 14 other autosomal genes for nucleotide diversity. The noncoding regions of ATM had diversity values comparable to other genes, but the coding regions had very low diversity, especially in the last 29% of the protein sequence. A test of the neutral evolution hypothesis, through use of the Hudson/Kreitman/Aguad\u00e9 statistic, revealed that this region of the human ATM gene was significantly constrained relative to that of the orangutan, the Old World monkey, and the mouse, but not relative to that of the chimpanzee or the gorilla. ATM displayed extensive linkage disequilibrium, consistent with suppression of meiotic recombination at this locus. Seven haplotypes were defined. Two haplotypes accounted for 82% of all chromosomes analyzed in all major populations; two others carrying the same D126E missense polymorphism accounted for 33% of chromosomes in Africa but were never observed outside of Africa.

The changes in global gene expression and secreted cytokine profiles induced by lytic or benign enterovirus infections were studied in primary human pancreatic islet using DNA microarrays and viral strains either isolated at the clinical onset of type 1 diabetes or capable of causing a diabetes-like condition in mice.

We then used partial coherence to remove contributions of the coherent auditory speech signal from the lip-brain coherence. Comparing this synchronization between different attention conditions revealed that attending visual speech enhances the coherence between activity in visual cortex and the speaker's lips.

However, the predictors of diabetes risk are insufficiently understood. We evaluated, whether 31 novel biomarkers could help to predict the risk of incident diabetes.   \n METHODS AND FINDINGS The biomarkers were evaluated primarily in the FINRISK97 cohort (n = 7,827; 417 cases of clinically incident diabetes during the follow-up). The findings were replicated in the Health 2000 cohort (n = 4,977; 179 cases of clinically incident diabetes during the follow-up). We used Cox proportional hazards models to calculate the relative risk of diabetes, after adjusting for the classic risk factors, separately for each biomarker. Next, we assessed the discriminatory ability of single biomarkers using receiver operating characteristic curves and C-statistics, integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and net reclassification improvement (NRI). Finally, we derived a biomarker score in the FINRISK97 cohort and validated it in the Health 2000 cohort. A score consisting of adiponectin, apolipoprotein B, C-reactive protein and ferritin almost doubled the relative risk of diabetes in the validation cohort (HR per one standard deviation increase 1.88, p = 2.8 e-5). It also improved discrimination of the model (IDI = 0.0149, p<0.0001) and reclassification of diabetes risk (NRI = 11.8%, p = 0.006). Gender-specific analyses suggested that the best score differed between men and women. Among men, the best results were obtained with the score of four biomarkers: adiponectin, apolipoprotein B, ferritin and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, which gave an NRI of 25.4% (p<0.0001). Among women, the best score included adiponectin, apolipoprotein B, C-reactive protein and insulin. It gave an NRI of 13.6% (p = 0.041).   \n CONCLUSIONS We identified novel biomarkers that were associated with the risk of clinically incident diabetes over and above the classic risk factors.

We found that RACK1 binds both the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor and the nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase, Fyn. RACK1 inhibits Fyn phosphorylation of NR2B and decreases NMDA receptor-mediated currents in CA1 hippocampal slices (Yaka, R., Thornton, C., Vagts, A. J., Phamluong, K., Bonci, A., and Ron, D. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 99, 5710-5715). Here, we identified the signaling cascade by which RACK1 is released from the NMDA receptor complex and identified the consequences of the dissociation. We found that activation of the cAMP/protein kinase A pathway in hippocampal slices induced the release of RACK1 from NR2B and Fyn. This resulted in the induction of NR2B phosphorylation and the enhancement of NMDA receptor-mediated activity via Fyn. We identified the neuropeptide, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP(1-38)), as a ligand that induced phosphorylation of NR2B and enhanced NMDA receptor potentials. Finally, we found that activation of the cAMP/protein kinase A pathway induced the movement of RACK1 to the nuclear compartment in dissociated hippocampal neurons. Nuclear RACK1 in turn was found to regulate the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor induced by PACAP(1-38). Taken together our results suggest that activation of adenylate cyclase by PACAP(1-38) results in the release of RACK1 from the NMDA receptor and Fyn. This in turn leads to NMDA receptor phosphorylation, enhanced activity mediated by Fyn, and to the induction of brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression by RACK1.", "output": "Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP(1-38)) enhances N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor function and brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression via RACK1.", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

However, little information is available on oncologists' perceptions of the risk of VTE and its management. The Fundamental Research in Oncology and Thrombosis (FRONTLINE) study is the first comprehensive global survey of thrombosis and cancer. The study was designed to collect data on the perceived risk and patterns of practice with regard to VTE in cancer patients undergoing surgical and medical management of their malignancy and to provide information on international and regional practice patterns, allowing for the design of research studies to answer the concerns of practicing clinicians.   \n METHODS Literature reviews were performed to provide a current evidence base against which to compare the findings, and a survey was developed under the guidance of an advisory board. A paper-based reply-paid questionnaire was distributed globally between July and November 2001 to clinicians involved in cancer care and was made available on a dedicated website.   \n FINDINGS A total of 3,891 completed responses were available for analysis. Brain and pancreatic tumors were considered to carry a high risk for VTE, and 80% of respondents considered the use of central venous lines to be associated with a high risk of VTE. Marked differences were seen in the use of thromboprophylaxis for surgical and medical cancer patients, with over 50% of surgeons reporting that they initiated thromboprophylaxis routinely, while most medical oncologists reported using thromboprophylaxis in less than 5% of medical patients. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was the most popular method of thromboprophylaxis employed in both surgical and medical patients and was more favored by European than U.S. clinicians. Some 20% of respondents reported using aspirin for prophylaxis, despite there being no reliable evidence for this agent as effective in prevention in this population. For the treatment of VTE, LMWH was again the most common initial treatment, although, for the long-term, oral anticoagulation therapy was widely adopted. Many patients were treated for VTE on an outpatient basis, and secondary prevention of VTE was typically continued for 3 to 6 months after an episode of deep vein thrombosis or for longer in the case of pulmonary embolism.   \n INTERPRETATION The results of the FRONTLINE survey demonstrate a need for guidelines to direct clinical practice in line with evidence-based data concerning cancer and VTE. Oncologists need to be educated regarding the true risks of VTE associated with certain cancers and on strategies for prevention and treatment to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with VTE in all cancer patients.

Herein we present the three-dimensional structure of the selenomethionine variant of human RuvBL1 refined using diffraction data to 2.2A of resolution.

Structural homology and DNA binding studies demonstrate that the second domain, which is unique among AAA(+) proteins and not present in the bacterial homolog RuvB, is a novel DNA/RNA-binding domain. We were able to demonstrate that RuvBL1 interacted with single-stranded DNA/RNA and double-stranded DNA.

Histidine kinases (HKs) phosphorylate and dephosphorylate their cognate response regulators (RRs) in response to stimuli. In general, these reactions appear to be highly specific and require an appropriate association between the HK and RR proteins. The Myxococcus xanthus genome encodes one of the largest repertoires of signaling proteins in bacteria (685 open reading frames [ORFs]), including at least 127 HKs and at least 143 RRs. Of these, 27 are bona fide NtrC-family response regulators, 21 of which are encoded adjacent to their predicted cognate kinases. Using system-wide profiling methods, we determined that the HK-NtrC RR pairs display a kinetic preference during both phosphotransfer and phosphatase functions, thereby defining cognate signaling systems in M. xanthus. Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements indicated that cognate HK-RR pairs interact with dissociation constants (Kd) of approximately 1 \u00b5M, while noncognate pairs had no measurable binding. Lastly, a chimera generated between the histidine kinase, CrdS, and HK1190 revealed that residues conferring phosphotransfer and phosphatase specificity dictate binding affinity, thereby establishing discrete protein-protein interactions which prevent cross talk. The data indicate that binding affinity is a critical parameter governing system-wide signaling fidelity for bacterial signal transduction proteins.    IMPORTANCE Using in vitro phosphotransfer and phosphatase profiling assays and isothermal titration calorimetry, we have taken a system-wide approach to demonstrate specificity for a family of two-component signaling proteins in Myxococcus xanthus.

Despite ample biologic plausibility, epidemiologic studies to date have yielded conflicting results. We investigated the associations between perinatal factors and subsequent breast cancer risk through meta-analyses.   \n METHODS We reviewed breast cancer studies published from January 1966 to February 2007 that included data on birth weight, birth order, maternal age, gestational age, twin status, and maternal or paternal smoking. Meta-analyses using random effect models were employed to summarize the results.   \n RESULTS We found that heavier birth weights were associated with increased breast cancer risk, with studies involving five categories of birth weight identifying odds ratios (ORs) of 1.24 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 to 1.48) for 4,000 g or more and 1.15 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.26) for 3,500 g to 3,999 g, relative to a birth weight of 2,500 to 2,599 g. These studies provided no support for a J-shaped relationship of birthweight to risk. Support for an association with birthweight was also derived from studies based on three birth weight categories (OR 1.15 [95% CI 1.01 to 1.31] for > or =4,000 g relative to <3,000 g) and two birth weight categories (OR 1.09 [95% CI 1.02 to 1.18] for > or =3,000 g relative to <3,000 g). Women born to older mothers and twins were also at some increased risk, but the results were heterogeneous across studies and publication years. Birth order, prematurity, and maternal smoking were unrelated to breast cancer risk.   \n CONCLUSION Our findings provide some support for the hypothesis that in utero exposures reflective of higher endogenous hormone levels could affect risk for development of breast cancer in adulthood.", "output": "Intrauterine environments and breast cancer risk: meta-analysis and systematic review", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

We included patients who were older than 65 years who visited the ED with any medical problems. Baseline RDW values were measured at the time of admission to the ED. The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Multivariate logistic analysis was performed.   \n RESULTS A total of 1,990 patients were finally included in this study. The mean age was 75 years (SD 7), and 936 (47 %) subjects were male. The in-hospital mortality rate was 3.76 % (74 patients). RDW values higher in non-survivors than in survivors (15.9 \u00b1 2.5 vs. 13.8 \u00b1 1.7, p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic analysis showed that RDW was associated with all-cause in-hospital mortality after adjusting for other confounding factors.    DISCUSSION RDW value at admission is an independent predictor of all-cause in-hospital mortality among patients older than 65 years. After adjustment for multiple confounders, the all-cause in-hospital mortality rate increased by 21.8% for each 1% increase in RDW.   \n CONCLUSION These results show that RDW at admission is associated with in-hospital mortality among patients older than 65. Thus, RDW at admission may represent a surrogate marker of disease severity.

Many of them are poor candidates for stage-specific lung cancer treatment due to diminished lung function and poor functional status, and many forego treatment. The negative effect of COPD may be moderated by pulmonologist-guided management.   \n OBJECTIVES This study examined the association between pulmonologist management and the probability of receiving the recommended stage-specific treatment modality and overall survival among patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with preexisting COPD.   \n METHODS Early- and advanced-stage NSCLC cases diagnosed between 2002 and 2005 with a prior COPD diagnosis (3-24 months before NSCLC diagnosis) were identified in Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results tumor registry data linked to Medicare claims. Study outcomes included receipt of recommended stage-specific treatment (surgical resection for early-stage NSCLC and chemotherapy for advanced-stage NSCLC [advNSCLC]) and overall survival. Pulmonologist management was considered present if one or more Evaluation and Management visit claims with pulmonologist specialty were observed within 6 months after NSCLC diagnosis. Stage-specific multivariate logistic regression tested association between pulmonologist management and treatment received. Cox proportional hazard models examined the independent association between pulmonologist care and mortality. Two-stage residual inclusion instrumental variable (2SRI-IV) analyses tested and adjusted for potential confounding based on unobserved factors or measurement error.   \n MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The cohorts included 5,488 patients with early-stage NSCLC and 6,426 patients with advNSCLC disease with preexisting COPD. Pulmonologist management was recorded for 54.9% of patients with early stage NSCLC and 35.7% of patients with advNSCLC. Of those patients with pulmonologist involvement, 58.5% of patients with early NSCLC received surgical resection, and 43.6% of patients with advNSCLC received chemotherapy. Pulmonologist management post NSCLC diagnosis was associated with increased surgical resection rates (odds ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-1.45) for early NSCLC and increased chemotherapy rates (odds ratio, 1.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.67-2.10) for advNSCLC. Pulmonologist management was also associated with reduced mortality risk for patients with early-stage NSCLC but not AdvNSCLC.   \n CONCLUSIONS Pulmonologist management had a positive association with rates of stage-specific treatment in both groups and overall survival in early-stage NSCLC.

Samples from seventy glioma patients following surgery were compared with those from brain trauma patients as a non-tumor control group. Exosomal miR-21 levels in the CSF of glioma patients were found significantly higher than in the controls; whereas no difference was detected in serum-derived exosomal miR-21 expression. The CSF-derived exosomal miR-21 levels correlated with tumor spinal/ventricle metastasis and the recurrence with anatomical site preference. From additional 198 glioma tissue samples, we verified that miR-21 levels associated with tumor grade of diagnosis and negatively correlated with the median values of patient overall survival time. We further used a lentiviral inhibitor to suppress miR-21 expression in U251 cells. The results showed that the levels of miR-21 target genes of PTEN, RECK and PDCD4 were up-regulated at protein levels.

N348I has been associated with resistance to the non-nucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI), nevirapine; however, a possible mechanism that links changes in RNase H activity to changes in NNRTI susceptibility remains to be established. To address this problem, we consider recent findings suggesting that NNRTIs may affect the orientation of RT on its nucleic acid substrate and increase RNase H activity. Here we demonstrate that RNase H-mediated primer removal is indeed more efficient in the presence of NNRTIs; however, the N348I mutant enzyme is able to counteract this effect.

One major consequence of CARS is the modification of the immune status that could favour the enhanced susceptibility of intensive care patients to nosocomial infections. Indeed, most animal 'two-hit' models illustrate an enhanced sensitivity to infection after a first insult. However, this observation is highly dependent on the experimental procedure. Numerous functions of circulating leukocytes are altered in sepsis and SIRS patients, as well as in animal models of sepsis or SIRS. However, this is rather a reprogramming of circulating leukocytes, since there is not a global defect of the immune cells functions. Furthermore, within tissues, leukocytes are rather primed or activated than immunosuppressed.

Here, we report that the spatial Ca(2+) gradient within the oscillation is key. Ca(2+) oscillations in mast cells evoked over a range of agonist concentrations in the presence of external Ca(2+) were indistinguishable from those in the absence of Ca(2+) when plasmalemmal Ca(2+) extrusion was suppressed.

Local Ca(2+) influx and not global Ca(2+) oscillations therefore drives gene expression at physiological levels of stimulation. Rather than serving to maintain Ca(2+) oscillations by replenishing stores, we suggest that the role of oscillations might be to activate CRAC channels, thereby ensuring the generation of spatially restricted physiological Ca(2+) signals driving gene activation.

Aberrant expression of a HOX-gene dominated stem-cell signature in glioblastoma has been linked with increased resistance to chemo-radiotherapy and sustained proliferation of glioma initiating cells. Here we describe the epigenetic and genetic alterations and their interactions associated with the expression of this signature in glioblastoma.   \n RESULTS We observe prominent hypermethylation of the HOXA locus 7p15.2 in glioblastoma in contrast to non-tumoral brain. Hypermethylation is associated with a gain of chromosome 7, a hallmark of glioblastoma, and may compensate for tumor-driven enhanced gene dosage as a rescue mechanism by preventing undue gene expression. We identify the CpG island of the HOXA10 alternative promoter that appears to escape hypermethylation in the HOX-high glioblastoma. An additive effect of gene copy gain at 7p15.2 and DNA methylation at key regulatory CpGs in HOXA10 is significantly associated with HOX-signature expression. Additionally, we show concordance between methylation status and presence of active or inactive chromatin marks in glioblastoma-derived spheres that are HOX-high or HOX-low, respectively.   \n CONCLUSIONS Based on these findings, we propose co-evolution and interaction between gene copy gain, associated with a gain of chromosome 7, and additional epigenetic alterations as key mechanisms triggering a coordinated, but inappropriate, HOX transcriptional program in glioblastoma.", "output": "Chromosome 7 gain and DNA hypermethylation at the HOXA10 locus are associated with expression of a stem cell related HOX-signature in glioblastoma", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

To investigate the downstream pathways responsible for these phenotypes, we analyzed the impact of inactivating APC in the context of deficiency of the potentially key effectors beta-catenin and c-Myc. beta-catenin loss rescues both the proliferation and hepatomegaly phenotypes after APC loss. However, c-Myc deletion, which rescues the phenotypes of APC loss in the intestine, had no effect on the phenotypes of APC loss in the liver.

Specimens were promptly fixed in Carnoy's fixative, processed, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and examined by immunohistochemistry for MMP and cytokine production. In addition, human articular chondrocytes (HAC) were treated in vitro with either IL-1beta, TNFalpha, or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) to assess their potential to produce each of the MMPs, as determined by Western blotting and gelatin zymography.   \n RESULTS Immunodetection of the collagenases (MMPs 1, 8, and 13) and stromelysin 1 (MMP-3) was demonstrated in a proportion of chondrocytes in the superficial zone of almost all of the OA specimens that had degenerative matrix changes. The gelatinases (MMPs 2 and 9) were also demonstrated by immunohistochemistry but were not so prominent. IL-1beta- and TNFalpha-positive chondrocytes were also observed in a proportion of cells in the superficial zones of OA specimens. Much less immunostaining for MMPs and cytokines was observed in the deep zone of all OA specimens, where the cartilage matrix and chondrocyte morphology appeared normal. In contrast, full-thickness normal cartilage specimens showed virtually no immunostaining for these MMPs or cytokines. Confirmation that chondrocytes can produce these 6 MMPs was obtained from HAC cultures treated with either IL-1beta, TNFalpha, or PMA; conditioned medium from activated HAC contained all the MMPs demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. Dual immunolocalization studies of OA cartilage specimens demonstrated the coexpression of IL-1 with MMP-8 by individual chondrocytes in situ.   \n CONCLUSION These results indicate that the superficial zone of OA cartilage specimens, which is characterized by fibrillations, chondrocyte clusters, and degenerative matrix changes, contains a variable proportion of cells that immunostain for IL-1beta, TNFalpha, and 6 different MMPs.

Exposure to a high glucose concentration has recently been shown to increase phosphorylation of AMPK at Ser(485/491) of its \u03b11/\u03b12 subunit; however, the mechanism by which it does so is not known. Diacylglycerol (DAG), which is also increased in muscle exposed to high glucose, activates a number of signaling molecules including protein kinase (PK)C and PKD1. We sought to determine whether PKC or PKD1 is involved in inhibition of AMPK by causing Ser(485/491) phosphorylation in skeletal muscle cells. C2C12 myotubes were treated with the PKC/D1 activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), which acts as a DAG mimetic. This caused dose- and time-dependent increases in AMPK Ser(485/491) phosphorylation, which was associated with a \u223c60% decrease in AMPK\u03b12 activity. Expression of a phosphodefective AMPK\u03b12 mutant (S491A) prevented the PMA-induced reduction in AMPK activity. Serine phosphorylation and inhibition of AMPK activity were partially prevented by the broad PKC inhibitor G\u00f66983 and fully prevented by the specific PKD1 inhibitor CRT0066101. Genetic knockdown of PKD1 also prevented Ser(485/491) phosphorylation of AMPK. Inhibition of previously identified kinases that phosphorylate AMPK at this site (Akt, S6K, and ERK) did not prevent these events. PMA treatment also caused impairments in insulin-signaling through Akt, which were prevented by PKD1 inhibition. Finally, recombinant PKD1 phosphorylated AMPK\u03b12 at Ser(491) in cell-free conditions. These results identify PKD1 as a novel upstream kinase of AMPK\u03b12 Ser(491) that plays a negative role in insulin signaling in muscle cells.", "output": "PKD1 Inhibits AMPK\u03b12 through Phosphorylation of Serine 491 and Impairs Insulin Signaling in Skeletal Muscle Cells.", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

Nevertheless, bypass ability varies widely, with increases in mispair severity gradually reducing bypass products from 85 to 6%.

The integrity of sperm chromatin is a clinical indicator of male fertility and in vitro fertilization potential: chromosome aneuploidy and DNA decondensation or damage are correlated with reproductive failure. Identifying conserved proteins important for sperm chromatin structure and packaging can reveal universal causes of infertility. Here we combine proteomics, cytology and functional analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans to identify spermatogenic chromatin-associated proteins that are important for fertility. Our strategy employed multiple steps: purification of chromatin from comparable meiotic cell types, namely those undergoing spermatogenesis or oogenesis; proteomic analysis by multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) of factors that co-purify with chromatin; prioritization of sperm proteins based on abundance; and subtraction of common proteins to eliminate general chromatin and meiotic factors. Our approach reduced 1,099 proteins co-purified with spermatogenic chromatin, currently the most extensive catalogue, to 132 proteins for functional analysis. Reduction of gene function through RNA interference coupled with protein localization studies revealed conserved spermatogenesis-specific proteins vital for DNA compaction, chromosome segregation, and fertility.

EBV miRNAs are grouped into two clusters located either adjacent to the BHRF1 gene or in introns contained within the viral BART transcripts. To understand the role of the BHRF1 miRNA cluster, we have constructed a virus mutant that lacks all its three members (\u0394123) and a revertant virus. Here we show that the B cell transforming capacity of the \u0394123 EBV mutant is reduced by more than 20-fold, relative to wild type or revertant viruses.

Furthermore, they displayed higher latent gene expression levels and latent protein production than their wild type counterparts. Therefore, the BHRF1 miRNAs accelerate B cell expansion at lower latent gene expression levels. Thus, this miRNA cluster simultaneously enhances expansion of the virus reservoir and reduces the viral antigenic load, two features that have the potential to facilitate persistence of the virus in the infected host.

This signaling system is required for normal vascular development in the retina and for vascular survival in the cochlea. In mammals, the pattern of Ndp expression beyond the retina is poorly defined due to the low abundance of Norrin mRNA and protein. Here, we characterize Ndp expression during mouse development by studying a knock-in mouse that carries the coding sequence of human placental alkaline phosphatase (AP) inserted at the Ndp locus (Ndp(AP)). In the CNS, Ndp(AP) expression is apparent by E10.5 and is dynamic and complex. The anatomically delimited regions of Ndp(AP) expression observed prenatally in the CNS are replaced postnatally by widespread expression in astrocytes in the forebrain and midbrain, Bergman glia in the cerebellum, and M\u00fcller glia in the retina. In the developing and adult cochlea, Ndp(AP) expression is closely associated with two densely vascularized regions, the stria vascularis and a capillary plexus between the organ of Corti and the spiral ganglion. These observations suggest the possibility that Norrin may have developmental and/or homeostatic functions beyond the retina and cochlea.", "output": "Expression of the Norrie disease gene (Ndp) in developing and adult mouse eye, ear, and brain.", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

Preferred titles are under thirty words.", "input": "CONTEXT For the last 40 yr, the first line of treatment for anovulation in infertile women has been clomiphene citrate (CC). CC is a safe, effective oral agent but is known to have relatively common antiestrogenic endometrial and cervical mucous side effects that could prevent pregnancy in the face of successful ovulation. In addition, there is a significant risk of multiple pregnancy with CC, compared with natural cycles. Because of these problems, we proposed the concept of aromatase inhibition as a new method of ovulation induction that could avoid many of the adverse effects of CC. The objective of this review was to describe the different physiological mechanisms of action for CC and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) and compare studies of efficacy for both agents for ovulation induction.    EVIDENCE ACQUISITION We conducted a systematic review of all the published studies, both controlled and noncontrolled, comparing CC and AI treatment, either alone or in combination with gonadotropins, for ovulation induction or augmentation, identified through the Entrez-PubMed search engine.    EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS Because of the recent acceptance of the concept of using AIs for ovulation induction, few controlled studies were identified, and the rest of the studies were pilot or preliminary comparisons. Based on these studies, it appears that AIs are as effective as CC in inducing ovulation, are devoid of any antiestrogenic side effects, result in lower serum estrogen concentrations, and are associated with good pregnancy rates with a lower incidence of multiple pregnancy than CC. When combined with gonadotropins for assisted reproductive technologies, AIs reduce the dose of FSH required for optimal follicle recruitment and improve the response to FSH in poor responders.   \n CONCLUSIONS Preliminary evidence suggests that AIs may replace CC in the future because of similar efficacy with a reduced side effect profile. Although worldwide experience with AIs for ovulation induction is increasing, at present, definitive studies in the form of randomized controlled trials comparing CC with AIs are lacking.", "output": "0021-972X/06/$15.00/0 The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism 91(3):760\u2013771 Printed in U.S.A.

Impaired angiogenesis in fat depots has been implicated in the development of adipose tissue capillary rarefaction, hypoxia, inflammation, and metabolic dysfunction. We have recently demonstrated that impaired adipose tissue angiogenesis is associated with overexpression of antiangiogenic factor VEGF-A165b in human fat and the systemic circulation. In the present study, we postulated that upregulation of WNT5A is associated with angiogenic dysfunction and examined its role in regulating VEGF-A165b expression in human obesity. We biopsied subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue from 38 obese individuals (body mass index: 44 \u00b1 7 kg/m2, age: 37 \u00b1 11 yr) during planned bariatric surgery and characterized depot-specific protein expression of VEGF-A165b and WNT5A using Western blot analysis. In both subcutaneous and visceral fat, VEGF-A165b expression correlated strongly with WNT5A protein (r = 0.9, P < 0.001). In subcutaneous adipose tissue where angiogenic capacity is greater than in the visceral depot, exogenous human recombinant WNT5A increased VEGF-A165b expression in both whole adipose tissue and isolated vascular endothelial cell fractions (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). This was associated with markedly blunted angiogenic capillary sprout formation in human fat pad explants. Moreover, recombinant WNT5A increased secretion of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, a negative regulator of angiogenesis, in the sprout media (P < 0.01). Both VEGF-A165b-neutralizing antibody and secreted frizzled-related protein 5, which acts as a decoy receptor for WNT5A, significantly improved capillary sprout formation and reduced soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 production (P < 0.05). We demonstrated a significant regulatory nexus between WNT5A and antiangiogenic VEGF-A165b in the adipose tissue of obese subjects that was linked to angiogenic dysfunction. Elevated WNT5A expression in obesity may function as a negative regulator of angiogenesis.

In prostate cancer, several lncRNAs have been nominated as critical actors in disease pathogenesis. Among these, expression of PCGEM1 and PRNCR1 has been identified as a possible component in disease progression through the coordination of androgen receptor (AR) signaling (Yang et al., Nature 2013, see ref. [1]). However, concerns regarding the robustness of these findings have been suggested. Here, we sought to evaluate whether PCGEM1 and PRNCR1 are associated with prostate cancer. Through a comprehensive analysis of RNA-sequencing data (RNA-seq), we find evidence that PCGEM1 but not PRNCR1 is associated with prostate cancer. We employ a large cohort of >230 high-risk prostate cancer patients with long-term outcomes data to show that, in contrast to prior reports, neither gene is associated with poor patient outcomes. We further observe no evidence that PCGEM1 nor PRNCR1 interact with AR, and neither gene is a component of AR signaling.

Furthermore, etiolated tbr hypocotyls have reduced length with swollen epidermal cells, a phenotype characteristic for primary cesa mutants or the wild type treated with cellulose synthesis inhibitors.

Objectives To compare the effects of oral semaglutide with placebo (primary) and open-label subcutaneous semaglutide (secondary) on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Design, Setting, and Patients Phase 2, randomized, parallel-group, dosage-finding, 26-week trial with 5-week follow-up at 100 sites (hospital clinics, general practices, and clinical research centers) in 14 countries conducted between December 2013 and December 2014. Of 1106 participants assessed, 632 with type 2 diabetes and insufficient glycemic control using diet and exercise alone or a stable dose of metformin were randomized. Randomization was stratified by metformin use. Interventions Once-daily oral semaglutide of 2.5 mg (n = 70), 5 mg (n = 70), 10 mg (n = 70), 20 mg (n = 70), 40-mg 4-week dose escalation (standard escalation; n = 71), 40-mg 8-week dose escalation (slow escalation; n = 70), 40-mg 2-week dose escalation (fast escalation, n = 70), oral placebo (n = 71; double-blind) or once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide of 1.0 mg (n = 70) for 26 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end point was change in hemoglobing A1c (HbA1c) from baseline to week 26. Secondary end points included change from baseline in body weight and adverse events. Results Baseline characteristics were comparable across treatment groups. Of the 632 randomized patients (mean age, 57.1 years [SD, 10.6]; men, 395 (62.7%); diabetes duration, 6.3 years [SD, 5.2]; body weight, 92.3 kg [SD, 16.8]; BMI, 31.7 [SD, 4.3]), 583 (92%) completed the trial. Mean change in HbA1c level from baseline to week 26 decreased with oral semaglutide (dosage-dependent range, \u22120.7% to \u22121.9%) and subcutaneous semaglutide (\u22121.9%) and placebo (\u22120.3%); oral semaglutide reductions were significant vs placebo (dosage-dependent estimated treatment difference [ETD] range for oral semaglutide vs placebo, \u20130.4% to \u20131.6%; P = .01 for 2.5 mg, <.001 for all other dosages). Reductions in body weight were greater with oral semaglutide (dosage-dependent range, \u22122.1 kg to \u22126.9 kg) and subcutaneous semaglutide (\u22126.4 kg) vs placebo (\u22121.2 kg), and significant for oral semaglutide dosages of 10 mg or more vs placebo (dosage-dependent ETD range, \u20130.9 to \u20135.7 kg; P < .001). Adverse events were reported by 63% to 86% (371 of 490 patients) in the oral semaglutide groups, 81% (56 of 69 patients) in the subcutaneous semaglutide group, and 68% (48 of 71 patients) in the placebo group; mild to moderate gastrointestinal events were most common. Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with type 2 diabetes, oral semaglutide resulted in better glycemic control than placebo over 26 weeks.

Proliferation of infected cells is clonal and persistent in vivo. During the carrier state, infected cells are selected in vivo by the host's immune system, the genetic and epigenetic environment of proviral integration sites, and other factors. In leukemic cells, tax gene expression is frequently impaired by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Such loss of Tax expression enables ATL cells to escape the host immune system. On the other hand, ATL cells acquire the ability to proliferate without Tax by intracellular genetic and epigenetic changes. Despite advances in support and the development of novel treatment agents, the prognosis for ATLL remains poor. A number of therapies, however, do appear to improve prognosis compared to CHOP (VEPA). These include interferon-\u03b1 plus zidovudine (probably after 1\u20132 cycles of CHOP), intensive chemotherapy as in LSG-15 with G-CSF support and Allo-SCT (which includes the potential for cure). Emerging novel approaches include HDAC inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and proteasome inhibitors.

The effect of these chemokine receptors in tumorigenesis is mediated via interactions with shared ligands I-TAC (CXCL11) and SDF-1 (CXCL12). Over the last decade, CXCR4 has been extensively reported to be overexpressed in most human solid tumors and has earned considerable attention toward elucidating its role in cancer metastasis. To enrich the existing armamentarium of anti-cancerous agents, many inhibitors of CXCL12-CXCR4 axis have emerged as additional or alternative agents for neo-adjuvant treatments and even many of them are in preclinical and clinical stages of their development. However, the discovery of CXCR7 as another receptor for CXCL12 with rather high binding affinity and recent reports about its involvement in cancer progression, has questioned the potential of \"selective blockade\" of CXCR4 as cancer chemotherapeutics. Interestingly, CXCR7 can also bind another chemokine CXCL11, which is an established ligand for CXCR3. Recent reports have documented that CXCR3 and their ligands are overexpressed in different solid tumors and regulate tumor growth and metastasis. Therefore, it is important to consider the interactions and crosstalk between these three chemokine receptors and their ligand mediated signaling cascades for the development of effective anti-cancer therapies. Emerging evidence also indicates that these receptors are differentially expressed in tumor endothelial cells as well as in cancer stem cells, suggesting their direct role in regulating tumor angiogenesis and metastasis.

Several NLS proteins have been identified as spindle assembly factors, but the complexity of the process led us to search for additional proteins with distinct roles in spindle assembly.   \n RESULTS We identify a chromatin-remodeling ATPase, CHD4, as a RanGTP-dependent microtubule (MT)-associated protein (MAP). MT binding occurs via the region containing an NLS and chromatin-binding domains. In Xenopus egg extracts and cultured cells, CHD4 largely dissociates from mitotic chromosomes and partially localizes to the spindle. Immunodepletion of CHD4 from egg extracts significantly reduces the quantity of MTs produced around chromatin and prevents spindle assembly. CHD4 RNAi in both HeLa and Drosophila S2 cells induces defects in spindle assembly and chromosome alignment in early mitosis, leading to chromosome missegregation. Further analysis in egg extracts and in HeLa cells reveals that CHD4 is a RanGTP-dependent MT stabilizer. Moreover, the CHD4-containing NuRD complex promotes organization of MTs into bipolar spindles in egg extracts. Importantly, this function of CHD4 is independent of chromatin remodeling.   \n CONCLUSIONS Our results uncover a new role for CHD4 as a MAP required for MT stabilization and involved in generating spindle bipolarity.", "output": "CHD4 Is a RanGTP-Dependent MAP that Stabilizes Microtubules and Regulates Bipolar Spindle Formation", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

Path analyses were conducted to relate the quantity and quality of services that were received in the first three months of treatment to treatment retention and outcomes at the nine-month follow-up. Patients were determined to have a favorable outcome if for at least 30 days before the follow-up assessment they did not use drugs, were not involved in criminal activity, and lived in the community. The path analyses controlled for patients' baseline characteristics.   \n RESULTS Greater service intensity and satisfaction were positively related to either treatment completion or longer treatment retention, which in turn was related to favorable treatment outcomes. Patients with greater problem severity received more services and were more likely to be satisfied with treatment. These patterns were similar for patients regardless of whether they were treated in outpatient drug-free programs or residential programs.   \n CONCLUSIONS The positive association between process measures-that is, greater levels of service intensity, satisfaction, and either treatment completion or retention-and treatment outcome strongly suggests that improvements in these key elements of the treatment process will improve treatment outcomes.", "output": "Relationship between drug treatment services, retention, and outcomes.", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

The study was later amended to allow patients who progressed on lapatinib the option of receiving lapatinib plus capecitabine.    EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Eligible patients had HER2+ breast cancer, progressive brain metastases, prior trastuzumab, and cranial radiotherapy. The primary end point was CNS objective response, defined as >or=50% volumetric reduction of CNS lesion(s) in the absence of increasing steroid use, progressive neurologic signs and symptoms, or progressive extra-CNS disease.   \n RESULTS Two-hundred and forty-two patients entered the study. CNS objective responses to lapatinib were observed in 6% of patients. In an exploratory analysis, 21% of patients experienced a >or=20% volumetric reduction in their CNS lesions.

Inhibiting the activation of ERK and RSK in CHO cells by a mutation in the integrin \u03b21 cytoplasmic tail or with pharmacological inhibitors results in the accumulation of cells with midbodies and the formation of binucleated cells. Activation of ERK and RSK signaling by the expression of constitutively active RAF1 suppresses the mutant phenotype in a RSK-dependent manner. Constitutively active RSK2 also restores cytokinesis inhibited by the mutant integrin. Importantly, the regulatory role of the RSK pathway is not specific to CHO cells. MCF-10A human mammary epithelial cells and HPNE human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells exhibit a similar dependence on RSK for successful cytokinesis. In addition, depriving mitotic MCF10A cells of integrin-mediated adhesion by incubating them in suspension suppressed ERK and RSK activation and resulted in a failure of cytokinesis. Furthermore, inhibition of RSK or integrins within the 3D context of a developing salivary gland organ explant also leads to an accumulation of epithelial cells with midbodies, suggesting a similar defect in cytokinesis.

The most common histologic type, endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EC), accounts for 75-80% of patients. The objective of this work was to estimate the prevalence of concurrent carcinoma in women with a biopsy diagnosis of the precursor lesion, atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH).   \n METHODS This prospective cohort study included women who had a community diagnosis of AEH. Diagnostic biopsy specimens were reviewed independently by three gynecologic pathologists who used International Society of Gynecologic Pathologists/World Health Organization criteria. Study participants underwent hysterectomy within 12 weeks of entry onto protocol without interval treatment. The hysterectomy slides also were reviewed by the study pathologists, and their findings were used in the subsequent analyses.   \n RESULTS Between November 1998 and June 2003, 306 women were enrolled on the study. Of these, 17 women were not included in the analysis: Two patients had unreadable slides because of poor processing or insufficient tissue, 2 patients had only slides that were not endometrial, the slides for 5 patients were not available for review, and 8 of the hysterectomy specimens were excluded because they showed evidence of interval intervention, either progestin effect or ablation. In total, 289 patients were included in the current analysis. The study panel review of the AEH biopsy specimens was interpreted as follows: 74 of 289 specimens (25.6%) were diagnosed as less than AEH, 115 of 289 specimens (39.8%) were diagnosed as AEH, and 84 of 289 specimens (29.1%) were diagnosed as endometrial carcinoma. In 5.5% (16 of 289 specimens), there was no consensus on the biopsy diagnosis. The rate of concurrent endometrial carcinoma for analyzed specimens was 42.6% (123 of 289 specimens). Of these, 30.9% (38 of 123 specimens) were myoinvasive, and 10.6% (13 of 123 specimens) involved the outer 50% of the myometrium. Among the women who had hysterectomy specimens with carcinoma, 14 of 74 women (18.9%) had a study panel biopsy consensus diagnosis of less than AEH, 45 of 115 women (39.1%) had a study panel biopsy consensus diagnosis of AEH, and 54 of 84 women (64.3%) had a study panel diagnosis of carcinoma. Among women who had no consensus in their biopsy diagnosis, 10 of 16 women (62.5%) had carcinoma in their hysterectomy specimens.   \n CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of endometrial carcinoma in patients who had a community hospital biopsy diagnosis of AEH was high (42.6%). When considering management strategies for women who have a biopsy diagnosis of AEH, clinicians and patients should take into account the considerable rate of concurrent carcinoma.", "output": "Concurrent endometrial carcinoma in women with a biopsy diagnosis of atypical endometrial hyperplasia: a Gynecologic Oncology Group study.", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

Recent neuropathological studies show that the Lewy bodies, the intraneuronal landmark of PD, accumulate in several neuronal cell types in the brain. An ascending gradient of pathological involvement, from the medulla oblongata to neocortical areas has been reported. Thus the original view of PD as a disease characterized by selective damage of the dopaminergic neurons in the mesencephalon should be updated into the concept of a severe multisystemic neurodegenerative disorder. Additionally, the neuropathological alterations outside the substantia nigra are soundly correlated with the non-motor symptoms of PD. As a result of these findings, interest is growing in the identification of prodromal non-motor symptoms of PD. Indeed, data from the literature suggest that autonomic disturbances, olfactory dysfunctions, depression and sleep disorders (in particular REM-sleep behavior disorder) may represent prodromal non-motor symptoms of PD. Several tests are available to detect most of these symptoms. Thus, the identification of prodromal non-motor symptoms may contribute to the precocious diagnosis of PD, and might be useful in the future to test the efficacy of neuroprotective agents.", "output": "Prodromal non-motor symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

Although it was shown that activation of the senescence programme involves the up-regulation of cell-cycle regulators such as the inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases p16INK4A and p21CIP-1, the mechanisms underlying the senescence response remain to be resolved. In the case of stress-induced premature senescence, reactive oxygen species are considered important intermediates contributing to the phenotype. Moreover, distinct alterations of the cellular carbohydrate metabolism are known to contribute to oncogenic transformation, as is best documented for the phenomenon of aerobic glycolysis. These findings suggest that metabolic alterations are involved in tumourigenesis and tumour suppression; however, little is known about the metabolic pathways that contribute to these processes. Using the human fibroblast model of in vitro senescence, we analysed age-dependent changes in the cellular carbohydrate metabolism. Here we show that senescent fibroblasts enter into a metabolic imbalance, associated with a strong reduction in the levels of ribonucleotide triphosphates, including ATP, which are required for nucleotide biosynthesis and hence proliferation. ATP depletion in senescent fibroblasts is due to dysregulation of glycolytic enzymes, and finally leads to a drastic increase in cellular AMP, which is shown here to induce premature senescence.

Previous investigation has established a role for the CHEK2 gene in breast cancer aetiology, but studies have largely been limited to the rare 1100delC mutation. Whether common polymorphisms in this gene influence breast cancer risk remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to assess the importance of common CHEK2 variants on population risk for breast cancer by capturing the majority of diversity in the gene using haplotype tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs). Methods and Findings We analyzed 14 common SNPs spanning 52 kilobases (kb) of the CHEK2 gene in 92 Swedish women. Coverage evaluation indicated that these typed SNPs would efficiently convey association signal also from untyped SNPs in the same region. Six of the 14 SNPs predicted well both the haplotypic and single SNP variations within CHEK2. We genotyped these six tagSNPs in 1,577 postmenopausal breast cancer cases and 1,513 population controls, but found no convincing association between any common CHEK2 haplotype and breast cancer risk.

In included studies, the initial tuberculosis diagnosis, failure, and/or relapse were microbiologically confirmed, and patients received standardized rifampin- or rifabutin-containing regimens. Pooled cumulative incidence of treatment failure, death during treatment, and relapse were calculated using random-effects models. Multivariable meta-regression was performed using negative binomial regression.   \n RESULTS After screening 5158 citations, 6 randomized trials and 21 cohort studies were included. Relapse was more common with regimens using 2 months rifamycin (adjusted risk ratio, 3.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-11.7) than with regimens using rifamycin for at least 8 months. Compared with daily therapy in the initial phase (n=3352 patients from 35 study arms), thrice-weekly therapy (n=211 patients from 5 study arms) was associated with higher rates of failure (adjusted risk ratio, 4.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-10.4) and relapse [adjusted risk ratio, 4.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.8-12.8).

Recent data have shown that SFKs serve as a convergent point of multiple signaling pathways regulating N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the central nervous system. Multiple SFK molecules, such as Src and Fyn, closely associate with their substrate, NMDA receptors, via indirect and direct binding mechanisms. The NMDA receptor is associated with an SFK signaling complex consisting of SFKs; the SFK-activating phosphatase, protein tyrosine phosphatase \u03b1; and the SFK-inactivating kinase, C-terminal Src kinase. Early studies have demonstrated that intramolecular interactions with the SH2 or SH3 domain lock SFKs in a closed conformation. Disruption of the interdomain interactions can induce the activation of SFKs with multiple signaling pathways involved in regulation of this process. The enzyme activity of SFKs appears 'graded', exhibiting different levels coinciding with activation states. It has also been proposed that the SH2 and SH3 domains may stimulate catalytic activity of protein tyrosine kinases, such as Abl. Recently, it has been found that the enzyme activity of neuronal Src protein is associated with its stability, and that the SH2 and SH3 domain interactions may act not only to constrain the activation of neuronal Src, but also to regulate the enzyme activity of active neuronal Src.

We aimed to estimate the incidence of admissions and deaths for such infections in children younger than 5 years in 2010.   \n METHODS We estimated the incidence of admissions for severe and very severe ALRI in children younger than 5 years, stratified by age and region, with data from a systematic review of studies published between Jan 1, 1990, and March 31, 2012, and from 28 unpublished population-based studies. We applied these incidence estimates to population estimates for 2010, to calculate the global and regional burden in children admitted with severe ALRI in that year. We estimated in-hospital mortality due to severe and very severe ALRI by combining incidence estimates with case fatality ratios from hospital-based studies.   \n FINDINGS We identified 89 eligible studies and estimated that in 2010, 11\u00b79 million (95% CI 10\u00b73-13\u00b79 million) episodes of severe and 3\u00b70 million (2\u00b71-4\u00b72 million) episodes of very severe ALRI resulted in hospital admissions in young children worldwide. Incidence was higher in boys than in girls, the sex disparity being greatest in South Asian studies. On the basis of data from 37 hospital studies reporting case fatality ratios for severe ALRI, we estimated that roughly 265,000 (95% CI 160,000-450,000) in-hospital deaths took place in young children, with 99% of these deaths in developing countries. Therefore, the data suggest that although 62% of children with severe ALRI are treated in hospitals, 81% of deaths happen outside hospitals.   \n INTERPRETATION Severe ALRI is a substantial burden on health services worldwide and a major cause of hospital referral and admission in young children. Improved hospital access and reduced inequities, such as those related to sex and rural status, could substantially decrease mortality related to such infection. Community-based management of severe disease could be an important complementary strategy to reduce pneumonia mortality and health inequities.   \n FUNDING WHO.", "output": "Global and regional burden of hospital admissions for severe acute lower respiratory infections in young children in 2010: a systematic analysis", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

In some cases, however, epigenetic information can be transmitted from parent to progeny (multigenerational epigenetic inheritance). A particularly notable example of this type of epigenetic inheritance is double-stranded RNA-mediated gene silencing in Caenorhabditis elegans. This RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) can be inherited for more than five generations. To understand this process, here we conduct a genetic screen for nematodes defective in transmitting RNAi silencing signals to future generations. This screen identified the heritable RNAi defective 1 (hrde-1) gene. hrde-1 encodes an Argonaute protein that associates with small interfering RNAs in the germ cells of progeny of animals exposed to double-stranded RNA. In the nuclei of these germ cells, HRDE-1 engages the nuclear RNAi defective pathway to direct the trimethylation of histone H3 at Lys 9 (H3K9me3) at RNAi-targeted genomic loci and promote RNAi inheritance. Under normal growth conditions, HRDE-1 associates with endogenously expressed short interfering RNAs, which direct nuclear gene silencing in germ cells. In hrde-1- or nuclear RNAi-deficient animals, germline silencing is lost over generational time. Concurrently, these animals exhibit steadily worsening defects in gamete formation and function that ultimately lead to sterility. These results establish that the Argonaute protein HRDE-1 directs gene-silencing events in germ-cell nuclei that drive multigenerational RNAi inheritance and promote immortality of the germ-cell lineage.

However, the chemical nature of the anti-inflammatory compounds has not yet been determined.   \n METHODS Peptidomic analysis using mass spectrometry was applied to F. prausnitzii supernatant. Anti-inflammatory effects of identified peptides were tested in vitro directly on intestinal epithelial cell lines and on cell lines transfected with a plasmid construction coding for the candidate protein encompassing these peptides. In vivo, the cDNA of the candidate protein was delivered to the gut by recombinant lactic acid bacteria to prevent dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS)-colitis in mice.   \n RESULTS The seven peptides, identified in the F. prausnitzii culture supernatants, derived from a single microbial anti-inflammatory molecule (MAM), a protein of 15 kDa, and comprising 53% of non-polar residues. This last feature prevented the direct characterisation of the putative anti-inflammatory activity of MAM-derived peptides. Transfection of MAM cDNA in epithelial cells led to a significant decrease in the activation of the nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB pathway with a dose-dependent effect. Finally, the use of a food-grade bacterium, Lactococcus lactis, delivering a plasmid encoding MAM was able to alleviate DNBS-induced colitis in mice.   \n CONCLUSIONS A 15 kDa protein with anti-inflammatory properties is produced by F. prausnitzii, a commensal bacterium involved in CD pathogenesis.

Women in the discontinuation group received 20 mg of alendronate daily for two years and 5 mg daily in years 3, 4, and 5, followed by five years of placebo. Randomized group assignments and blinding were maintained throughout the 10 years. We report results for the 247 women who participated in all four phases of the study.   \n RESULTS Treatment with 10 mg of alendronate daily for 10 years produced mean increases in bone mineral density of 13.7 percent at the lumbar spine (95 percent confidence interval, 12.0 to 15.5 percent), 10.3 percent at the trochanter (95 percent confidence interval, 8.1 to 12.4 percent), 5.4 percent at the femoral neck (95 percent confidence interval, 3.5 to 7.4 percent), and 6.7 percent at the total proximal femur (95 percent confidence interval, 4.4 to 9.1 percent) as compared with base-line values; smaller gains occurred in the group given 5 mg daily. The discontinuation of alendronate resulted in a gradual loss of effect, as measured by bone density and biochemical markers of bone remodeling. Safety data, including fractures and stature, did not suggest that prolonged treatment resulted in any loss of benefit.   \n CONCLUSIONS The therapeutic effects of alendronate were sustained, and the drug was well tolerated over a 10-year period.

The study included 142 women who were initially treated with cerclage (USA), 59 with vaginal progesterone (UK) and 42 with cervical pessary (Spain). Perinatal outcomes were compared between the three cohorts.   \n RESULTS There were no statistically significant differences in perinatal losses, neonatal morbidity and preterm births among the three groups, apart from a higher rate of preterm birth before 34 weeks' gestation after treatment with vaginal progesterone in comparison with treatment with cervical pessary (32% vs 12%; relative risk (RR) = 2.70; 95% CI, 1.10-6.67). When only the subgroups of women with cervical length < 25 mm, irrespective of gestational age, were compared, the difference between these two cohorts was not statistically significant (RR = 2.21; 95% CI, 0.83-5.89).   \n CONCLUSION Cerclage, vaginal progesterone and pessary appear to have similar effectiveness as management strategies in women with singleton pregnancy, previous spontaneous preterm birth and short cervix.

Eighty-nine subjects were included into the study: 24 subjects (16M, 8F) were treated with rhGH from childhood, whereas 65 subjects (40M, 25F) were never treated. At the time of the interview all subjects had attained final height [mean (SD) -2.3 (0.9) SDS for Dutch references], and the age of the treated subjects was 20.5 (1.0) y, and 25.7 (3.5) y of the control subjects (p < 0.001). The level of education was similar, but the treated subjects had less often a partner compared to the control subjects (adjusted for age and gender, p < 0.001). The Nottingham Health Profile and Short Form 36 Health Survey showed no difference in general health state between treated and control subjects, and the healthy Dutch age-specific references (norm group). Although 74% of the subjects reported one or more negative events related to their height, and 61% would like to be taller, only 22% and 11% were willing to trade-off at Time Trade-Off and Standard Gamble, respectively. The personality of the subjects, which was measured by the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, was not different from the norm group. The satisfaction with the rhGH treatment was high, as it had caused 12 (8) cm and 13 (7) cm gain in final height according to the subjects and parents, respectively. Based on initial predicted adult height (Bayley & Pinneau), this gain was only 3.3 (5.6) cm. We concluded that although the treated subjects had a partner less often when compared to the control subjects, the quality of life of subjects with ISS at adult age is normal and appears not to be affected by rhGH therapy, The treated subjects were very satisfied with the treatment, probably by overestimation of the final height gain.", "output": "Quality of life of young adults with idiopathic short stature: effect of growth hormone treatment.

The forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factor DAF-16 (hereafter referred to as DAF-16/FOXO) is a central nexus in these responses, but despite its importance little is known about how it regulates its target genes. Proteomic identification of DAF-16/FOXO-binding partners in Caenorhabditis elegans and their subsequent functional evaluation by RNA interference revealed several candidate DAF-16/FOXO cofactors, most notably the chromatin remodeller SWI/SNF. DAF-16/FOXO and SWI/SNF form a complex and globally co-localize at DAF-16/FOXO target promoters. We show that specifically for gene activation, DAF-16/FOXO depends on SWI/SNF, facilitating SWI/SNF recruitment to target promoters, to activate transcription by presumed remodelling of local chromatin. For the animal, this translates into an essential role for SWI/SNF in DAF-16/FOXO-mediated processes, in particular dauer formation, stress resistance and the promotion of longevity.

Incorrect attachments, which lack tension, are unstable and release quickly, allowing another chance for biorientation. Stabilization of molecular interactions by tension also occurs in other physiological contexts, such as cell adhesion, motility, hemostasis, and tissue morphogenesis. Here, we review models for the stabilization of kinetochore attachments with an eye toward emerging models for other force-activated systems.

Eosinophils cultured from mouse bone marrow produced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in cell cultures expressing aquaporin-4 in the presence of NMO autoantibody (NMO-IgG).

We therefore tested the therapeutic effects of fingolimod in several rodent models of focal cerebral ischemia. To assess the translational significance of these findings, we asked whether fingolimod improved long-term behavioral outcomes, whether delayed treatment was still effective, and whether neuroprotection can be obtained in a second species.   \n METHODS We used rodent models of middle cerebral artery occlusion and cell-culture models of neurotoxicity and inflammation to examine the therapeutic potential and mechanisms of neuroprotection by fingolimod.   \n RESULTS In a transient mouse model, fingolimod reduced infarct size, neurological deficit, edema, and the number of dying cells in the core and periinfarct area. Neuroprotection was accompanied by decreased inflammation, as fingolimod-treated mice had fewer activated neutrophils, microglia/macrophages, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)-positive blood vessels. Fingolimod-treated mice showed a smaller infarct and performed better in behavioral tests up to 15 days after ischemia. Reduced infarct was observed in a permanent model even when mice were treated 4 hours after ischemic onset. Fingolimod also decreased infarct size in a rat model of focal ischemia. Fingolimod did not protect primary neurons against glutamate excitotoxicity or hydrogen peroxide, but decreased ICAM-1 expression in brain endothelial cells stimulated by tumor necrosis factor alpha.   \n INTERPRETATION These findings suggest that anti-inflammatory mechanisms, and possibly vasculoprotection, rather than direct effects on neurons, underlie the beneficial effects of fingolimod after stroke.

Considerable advances have since been made into the pathobiology (changes in organ function, morphology, cell biology, biochemistry, immunology, and circulation), management, and epidemiology of sepsis, suggesting the need for reexamination.   \n OBJECTIVE To evaluate and, as needed, update definitions for sepsis and septic shock.    PROCESS A task force (n = 19) with expertise in sepsis pathobiology, clinical trials, and epidemiology was convened by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Definitions and clinical criteria were generated through meetings, Delphi processes, analysis of electronic health record databases, and voting, followed by circulation to international professional societies, requesting peer review and endorsement (by 31 societies listed in the Acknowledgment).    KEY FINDINGS FROM EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS Limitations of previous definitions included an excessive focus on inflammation, the misleading model that sepsis follows a continuum through severe sepsis to shock, and inadequate specificity and sensitivity of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. Multiple definitions and terminologies are currently in use for sepsis, septic shock, and organ dysfunction, leading to discrepancies in reported incidence and observed mortality. The task force concluded the term severe sepsis was redundant.    RECOMMENDATIONS Sepsis should be defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. For clinical operationalization, organ dysfunction can be represented by an increase in the Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 2 points or more, which is associated with an in-hospital mortality greater than 10%. Septic shock should be defined as a subset of sepsis in which particularly profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than with sepsis alone. Patients with septic shock can be clinically identified by a vasopressor requirement to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg or greater and serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L (>18 mg/dL) in the absence of hypovolemia. This combination is associated with hospital mortality rates greater than 40%. In out-of-hospital, emergency department, or general hospital ward settings, adult patients with suspected infection can be rapidly identified as being more likely to have poor outcomes typical of sepsis if they have at least 2 of the following clinical criteria that together constitute a new bedside clinical score termed quickSOFA (qSOFA): respiratory rate of 22/min or greater, altered mentation, or systolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or less.   \n CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These updated definitions and clinical criteria should replace previous definitions, offer greater consistency for epidemiologic studies and clinical trials, and facilitate earlier recognition and more timely management of patients with sepsis or at risk of developing sepsis.", "output": "The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3).", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

Methods: The expression of different smooth muscle cell or osteogenesis markers in response to high concentrations of phosphate or exogenous bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) was examined by qRT-PCR and western blotting in rat VSMCs. Osteocalcin secretion was measured by radioimmunoassay. Differentiation and calcification of VSMCs were examined by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assay and Alizarin staining.

Apoptosis was determined by TUNEL assay and immunofluorescence imaging. Results: BMP-2 serum levels were significantly higher in CKD patients than in controls. High phosphate concentrations and BMP-2 induced VSMC apoptosis and upregulated the expression of \u03b2-catenin, Msx2, Runx2 and the phosphate cotransporter Pit1, whereas a BMP-2 neutralization antibody reversed these effects.

How this balance is achieved in mammals has not been resolved. Here, we determine the mechanism for 3' overhang synthesis in mouse cells by evaluating changes in telomeric overhangs throughout the cell cycle and at leading- and lagging-end telomeres. Apollo, a nuclease bound to the shelterin subunit TRF2, initiates formation of the 3' overhang at leading-, but not lagging-end telomeres. Hyperresection by Apollo is blocked at both ends by the shelterin protein POT1b. Exo1 extensively resects both telomere ends, generating transient long 3' overhangs in S/G2. CST/AAF, a DNA pol\u03b1.primase accessory factor, binds POT1b and shortens the extended overhangs produced by Exo1, likely through fill-in synthesis. 3' overhang formation is thus a multistep, shelterin-controlled process, ensuring functional telomeric overhangs at chromosome ends.", "output": "Telomeric 3\u2032 Overhangs Derive from Resection by Exo1 and Apollo and Fill-In by POT1b-Associated CST", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

The BAF (SWI/SNF) complex is essential for development, and has been demonstrated to remodel reconstituted chromatin in vitro and to control the accessibility of a few individual regions in vivo. However, it remains unclear where and how BAF controls the open chromatin landscape to regulate developmental processes, such as human epidermal differentiation.   \n RESULTS Using a novel \"on-plate\" ATAC-sequencing approach for profiling open chromatin landscapes with a low number of adherent cells, we demonstrate that the BAF complex is essential for maintaining 11.6 % of open chromatin regions in epidermal differentiation. These BAF-dependent open chromatin regions are highly cell-type-specific and are strongly enriched for binding sites for p63, a master epidermal transcription factor. The DNA sequences of p63 binding sites intrinsically favor nucleosome formation and are inaccessible in other cell types without p63 to prevent ectopic activation. In epidermal cells, BAF and p63 mutually recruit each other to maintain 14,853 open chromatin regions. We further demonstrate that BAF and p63 cooperatively position nucleosomes away from p63 binding sites and recruit transcriptional machinery to control tissue differentiation.   \n CONCLUSIONS BAF displays high specificity in controlling the open chromatin landscape during epidermal differentiation by cooperating with the master transcription factor p63 to maintain lineage-specific open chromatin regions.", "output": "A novel ATAC-seq approach reveals lineage-specific reinforcement of the open chromatin landscape via cooperation between BAF and p63", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

Set point viremia was established between days 42 and 60 p.i., with levels of approximately 10(5)-10(6) copies/ml in SM and mandrills, and lower levels (10(3)-10(5) copies/ml) in AGMs. VL during the chronic phase did not correlate with viral genome structure: SIVmnd-2 (a vpx-containing virus) and SIVmnd-1 (which does not contain vpu or vpx) replicated to similar levels in mandrills. VL was dependent on virus strain: vervets infected with three different viral strains showed different patterns of viral replication.

Crizotinib is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), ROS1, and another proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase, MET.   \n METHODS We enrolled 50 patients with advanced NSCLC who tested positive for ROS1 rearrangement in an expansion cohort of the phase 1 study of crizotinib. Patients were treated with crizotinib at the standard oral dose of 250 mg twice daily and assessed for safety, pharmacokinetics, and response to therapy. ROS1 fusion partners were identified with the use of next-generation sequencing or reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assays.   \n RESULTS The objective response rate was 72% (95% confidence interval [CI], 58 to 84), with 3 complete responses and 33 partial responses. The median duration of response was 17.6 months (95% CI, 14.5 to not reached). Median progression-free survival was 19.2 months (95% CI, 14.4 to not reached), with 25 patients (50%) still in follow-up for progression.

No correlation was observed between the type of ROS1 rearrangement and the clinical response to crizotinib. The safety profile of crizotinib was similar to that seen in patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC.   \n CONCLUSIONS In this study, crizotinib showed marked antitumor activity in patients with advanced ROS1-rearranged NSCLC.

Furthermore, the definition of central obesity using waist circumference may not be appropriate for Asians. The objectives of this study were to determine the optimal waist circumference for diagnosing central obesity in Asians and to estimate the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in an Asian population.    RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We used data from the 1998 Singapore National Health Survey, a cross-sectional survey involving 4,723 men and women of Chinese, Malay, and Asian-Indian ethnicity aged 18-69 years. Receiver operating characteristic analysis suggested that waist circumference >80 cm in women and >90 cm in men was a more appropriate definition of central obesity in this population. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome was then determined using the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) criteria with and without the modified waist circumference criteria.   \n RESULTS In Asians, decreasing waist circumference increased the crude prevalence of the metabolic syndrome from 12.2 to 17.9%. Using the modified Asian criteria, the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome increased from 2.9% in those aged 18-30 years to 31.0% in those aged 60-69 years. It was more common in men (prevalence 20.9% in men versus 15.5% in women; P < 0.001) and Asian Indians (prevalence 28.8% in Asian-Indians, 24.2% in Malays, and 14.8% in Chinese; P < 0.001).   \n CONCLUSIONS NCEP ATP III criteria, applied to an Asian population, will underestimate the population at risk.

The primary end point was to assess the safety, and the secondary end point included the preliminary efficacy to verify the right ventricular ejection fraction improvements between baseline and 3 months. Manufacturing and intracoronary delivery of CDCs were feasible, and no serious adverse events were reported within the 18-month follow-up. Patients treated with CDCs showed right ventricular ejection fraction improvement from baseline to 3-month follow-up (46.9%\u00b14.6% to 52.1%\u00b12.4%; P=0.008). Compared with controls at 18 months, cardiac MRI analysis of CDC-treated patients showed a higher right ventricular ejection fraction (31.5%\u00b16.8% versus 40.4%\u00b17.6%; P=0.049), improved somatic growth (P=0.0005), reduced heart failure status (P=0.003), and lower incidence of coil occlusion for collaterals (P=0.007).   \n CONCLUSIONS Intracoronary infusion of autologous CDCs seems to be feasible and safe in children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome after staged surgery.

Several DNA modifications such as 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) are catalysed by the ten eleven translocation (Tet) methylcytosine dioxygenase family members, and the roles of Tet proteins in regulating chromatin architecture and gene transcription independently of DNA methylation have been gradually uncovered. However, the regulation of immunity and inflammation by Tet proteins independent of their role in modulating DNA methylation remains largely unknown. Here we show that Tet2 selectively mediates active repression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) transcription during inflammation resolution in innate myeloid cells, including dendritic cells and macrophages.

Here, we found that infection by Listeria monocytogenes induced the early necroptotic death of Kupffer cells, which was followed by monocyte recruitment and an anti-bacterial type 1 inflammatory response. Kupffer cell death also triggered a type 2 response that involved the hepatocyte-derived alarmin interleukin-33 (IL-33) and basophil-derived interleukin-4 (IL-4). This led to the alternative activation of the monocyte-derived macrophages recruited to the liver, which thereby replaced ablated Kupffer cells and restored liver homeostasis. Kupffer cell death is therefore a key signal orchestrating type 1 microbicidal inflammation and type-2-mediated liver repair upon infection. This indicates that beyond the classical dichotomy of type 1 and type 2 responses, these responses can develop sequentially in the context of a bacterial infection and act interdependently, orchestrating liver immune responses and return to homeostasis, respectively.", "output": "Liver-resident macrophage necroptosis orchestrates type 1 microbicidal inflammation and type-2-mediated tissue repair during bacterial infection.", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

A key question is how robust are our approaches to discovering new TB drugs, and what measures could be taken to reduce the long and protracted clinical development of new drugs. The emergence of multi-drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis makes the discovery of new molecular scaffolds a priority, and the current situation even necessitates the re-engineering and repositioning of some old drug families to achieve effective control.

If not properly regulated, replication stress, such as fork stalling and collapse, can be induced at natural replication impediments present throughout the genome. The fork protection complex (FPC) is thought to play a critical role in stabilizing stalled replication forks at several known replication barriers including eukaryotic rDNA genes and the fission yeast mating-type locus. However, little is known about the role of the FPC at other natural impediments including telomeres. Telomeres are considered to be difficult to replicate due to the presence of repetitive GT-rich sequences and telomere-binding proteins. However, the regulatory mechanism that ensures telomere replication is not fully understood. Here, we report the role of the fission yeast Swi1(Timeless), a subunit of the FPC, in telomere replication. Loss of Swi1 causes telomere shortening in a telomerase-independent manner. Our epistasis analyses suggest that heterochromatin and telomere-binding proteins are not major impediments for telomere replication in the absence of Swi1. Instead, repetitive DNA sequences impair telomere integrity in swi1\u0394 mutant cells, leading to the loss of repeat DNA. In the absence of Swi1, telomere shortening is accompanied with an increased recruitment of Rad52 recombinase and more frequent amplification of telomere/subtelomeres, reminiscent of tumor cells that utilize the alternative lengthening of telomeres pathway (ALT) to maintain telomeres. These results suggest that Swi1 ensures telomere replication by suppressing recombination and repeat instability at telomeres.

In addition to treatment with conventional heart failure medications, patients were assigned to receive placebo or carvedilol. Enrollment began in June 2000 and the last dose was given in May 2005 (each patient received medication for 8 months).   \n INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to twice-daily dosing with placebo, low-dose carvedilol (0.2 mg/kg per dose if weight <62.5 kg or 12.5 mg per dose if weight > or =62.5 kg), or high-dose carvedilol (0.4 mg/kg per dose if weight <62.5 kg or 25 mg per dose if weight > or =62.5 kg) and were stratified according to whether each patient's systemic ventricle was a left ventricle or not.   \n MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was a composite measure of heart failure outcomes in patients receiving carvedilol (low- and high-dose combined) vs placebo. Secondary efficacy variables included individual components of this composite, echocardiographic measures, and plasma b-type natriuretic peptide levels.   \n RESULTS There was no statistically significant difference between groups for the composite end point based on the percentage of patients who improved, worsened, or were unchanged. Among 54 patients assigned to placebo, 30 improved (56%), 16 worsened (30%), and 8 were unchanged (15%); among 103 patients assigned to carvedilol, 58 improved (56%), 25 worsened (24%), and 20 were unchanged (19%). The rates of worsening were lower than expected. The odds ratio for worsened outcome for patients in the combined carvedilol group vs the placebo group was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.36-1.59; P = .47). A prespecified subgroup analysis noted significant interaction between treatment and ventricular morphology (P = .02), indicating a possible differential effect of treatment between patients with a systemic left ventricle (beneficial trend) and those whose systemic ventricle was not a left ventricle (nonbeneficial trend).   \n CONCLUSIONS These preliminary results suggest that carvedilol does not significantly improve clinical heart failure outcomes in children and adolescents with symptomatic systolic heart failure. However, given the lower than expected event rates, the trial may have been underpowered.

This study examined effects of daily subcutaneous treatment with GLP-1 mimetic, Liraglutide, on synaptic plasticity, hippocampal gene expression and metabolic control in adult obese diabetic (ob/ob) mice. Results:Long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by area CA1 was completely abolished in ob/ob mice compared with lean controls. Deleterious effects on LTP were rescued (P<0.001) with Liraglutide. Indeed, Liraglutide-treated mice exhibited superior LTP profile compared with lean controls (P<0.01). Expression of hippocampal brain-derived neurotropic factor and neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor-type 2 were not significantly different, but synaptophysin and Mash1 were decreased in ob/ob mice. Treatment with Liraglutide over 21 days increased expression of Mash1 in ob/ob mice (2.0-fold; P<0.01). These changes were associated with significantly reduced plasma glucose (21% reduction; P<0.05) and markedly improved plasma insulin concentrations (2.1- to 3.3-fold; P<0.05 to P<0.01). Liraglutide also significantly reduced the glycaemic excursion following an intraperitonal glucose load (area under curve (AUC) values: 22%; P<0.05) and markedly enhanced the insulin response to glucose (AUC values: 1.6-fold; P<0.05).

Lung tumor samples with corresponding microarray and clinical data were used. All patients were divided into subgroups based on age (< 70 vs > or = 70 years old) or sex. Gene expression signatures representing oncogenic pathway activation and tumor biology/microenvironment status were applied to these samples to obtain patterns of activation/deregulation.   \n MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Patterns of oncogenic and molecular signaling pathway activation that are reproducible and correlate with 5-year recurrence-free patient survival.   \n RESULTS Low- and high-risk patient clusters/cohorts were identified with the longest and shortest 5-year recurrence-free survival, respectively, within the age and sex NSCLC subgroups. These cohorts of NSCLC demonstrate similar patterns of pathway activation. In patients younger than 70 years, high-risk patients, with the shortest recurrence-free survival, demonstrated increased activation of the Src (25% vs 6%; P<.001) and tumor necrosis factor (76% vs 42%; P<.001) pathways compared with low-risk patients. High-risk patients aged 70 years or older demonstrated increased activation of the wound healing (40% vs 24%; P = .02) and invasiveness (64% vs 20%; P<.001) pathways compared with low-risk patients.

Probandwise concordance rates and correlations in monozygotic and dizygotic twins and siblings were calculated, and heritability was examined using the De Fries and Fulker regression technique.   \n RESULTS There was a narrow (additive) heritability of 0.75 to 0.91 which was robust across familial relationships (twin, sibling, and twin-sibling) and across definitions of ADHD as part of a continuum or as a disorder with various symptom cutoffs. There was no evidence for nonadditive genetic variation or for shared family environmental effects.   \n CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that ADHD is best viewed as the extreme of a behavior that varies genetically throughout the entire population rather than as a disorder with discrete determinants.

Depending on the region up to 60% of the entire ENS population responds to mechanical stress. MEN fire action potentials after mechanical stimulation of processes or soma although they are more sensitive to process deformation. There are at least two populations of MEN based on their sensitivity to different modalities of mechanical stress and on their firing pattern. (1) Rapidly, slowly and ultra-slowly adapting neurons which encode compressive forces. (2) Ultra-slowly adapting stretch-sensitive neurons encoding tensile forces. Rapid adaptation of firing is typically observed after compressive force while slow adaptation or ongoing spike discharge occurs often during tensile stress (stretch). All MEN have some common properties: they receive synaptic input, are low fidelity mechanoreceptors and are multifunctional in that some serve interneuronal others even motor functions. Consequently, MEN possess processes with mechanosensitive as well as efferent functions. This raises the intriguing hypothesis that MEN sense and control muscle activity at the same time as servo-feedback loop.

BM samples were analyzed by karyotype, high-density DNA arrays with respect to paired fibroblasts, and by selected oncogene sequencing. A specific pattern of chromosomal abnormalities was found in MDS/AML, which included 1q+ (44.8%), 3q+ (41.4%), -7/7q (17.2%), and 11q- (13.8%). Moreover, cryptic RUNX1/AML1 lesions (translocations, deletions, or mutations) were observed for the first time in FA (20.7%). Rare mutations of NRAS, FLT3-ITD, MLL-PTD, ERG amplification, and ZFP36L2-PRDM16 translocation, but no TP53, TET2, CBL, NPM1, and CEBP\u03b1 mutations were found. Frequent homozygosity regions were related not to somatic copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity but to consanguinity, suggesting that homologous recombination is not a common progression mechanism in FA. Importantly, the RUNX1 and other chromosomal/genomic lesions were found at the MDS/AML stages, except for 1q+, which was found at all stages. These data have implications for staging and therapeutic managing in FA patients, and also to analyze the mechanisms of clonal evolution and oncogenesis in a background of genomic instability and BM failure.", "output": "Myelodysplasia and leukemia of Fanconi anemia are associated with a specific pattern of genomic abnormalities that includes cryptic RUNX1/AML1 lesions.", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

In the present study, we have furthered our understanding and extended the observations to primary T lymphocytes from normal (gamma(+)) individuals. Surface TCR.CD3 components from CD4(+) gamma(-) T cells, other than CD3gamma, were detectable and similar in size to CD4(+) gamma(+) controls. Their native TCR.CD3 complex was also similar to CD4(+) gamma(+) controls, except for an alphabeta(deltaepsilon)(2)zeta(2) instead of an alphabetagammaepsilondeltaepsilonzeta(2) stoichiometry. In contrast, the surface TCRalpha, TCRbeta, and CD3delta chains of CD8(+) gamma(-) T cells did not possess their usual sizes. Using confocal immunofluorescence, TCRalpha was hardly detectable in CD8(+) gamma(-) T cells. Blue native gels (BN-PAGE) demonstrated the existence of a heterogeneous population of TCR.CD3 in these cells. Using primary peripheral blood T lymphocytes from normal (gamma(+)) donors, we performed a broad epitopic scan. In contrast to all other TCR.CD3-specific monoclonal antibodies, RW2-8C8 stained CD8(+) better than it did CD4(+) T cells, and the difference was dependent on glycosylation of the TCR.CD3 complex but independent of T cell activation or differentiation. RW2-8C8 staining of CD8(+) T cells was shown to be more dependent on lipid raft integrity than that of CD4(+) T cells. Finally, immunoprecipitation studies on purified primary CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells revealed the existence of TCR glycosylation differences between the two. Collectively, these results are consistent with the existence of conformational or topological lineage-specific differences in the TCR.CD3 from CD4(+) and CD8(+) wild type T cells. The differences may be relevant for cis interactions during antigen recognition and signal transduction.", "output": "Biochemical differences in the alphabeta T cell receptor.CD3 surface complex between CD8+ and CD4+ human mature T lymphocytes.", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

All CRISPR systems contain proteins of the CAS2 family, suggesting that these uncharacterized proteins play a central role in this process. Here we show that the CAS2 proteins represent a novel family of endoribonucleases. Six purified CAS2 proteins from diverse organisms cleaved single-stranded RNAs preferentially within U-rich regions. A representative CAS2 enzyme, SSO1404 from Sulfolobus solfataricus, cleaved the phosphodiester linkage on the 3'-side and generated 5'-phosphate- and 3'-hydroxyl-terminated oligonucleotides. The crystal structure of SSO1404 was solved at 1.6A resolution revealing the first ribonuclease with a ferredoxin-like fold. Mutagenesis of SSO1404 identified six residues (Tyr-9, Asp-10, Arg-17, Arg-19, Arg-31, and Phe-37) that are important for enzymatic activity and suggested that Asp-10 might be the principal catalytic residue. Thus, CAS2 proteins are sequence-specific endoribonucleases, and we propose that their role in the CRISPR-mediated anti-phage defense might involve degradation of phage or cellular mRNAs.", "output": "A novel family of sequence-specific endoribonucleases associated with the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats.", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

Samples were investigated for markers of HBV and HCV infection (HBsAg, HBeAg, HBV-DNA, Anti-HBs, anti-HBc, anti-HCV, HCV-RNA).   \n RESULTS 60/232 patients (23%) were anti-HCV positive. 78% of these sera were positive for HCV-RNA. 22/232 patients (9%) suffered from chronic HBV infection (HBsAg positive), 18/22 (82%) of these sera had detectable HBeAg and 19/22 (86%) HBV-DNA. Presence of HCV-RNA, HBeAg and amount of HBV-DNA were related to the degree of immunodeficiency. In contrast to the control group without HBV or HCV infection, patients infected with HIV and either HBV or HCV showed a direct correlation between a reduction in CD4 counts and decreased cholinesterase activity. In patients with AIDS, coinfection with HBV or HCV was associated with a reduced survival compared to controls (HBV: 212 days, 95%CI, 106-317; HCV: 267, 95%CI, 112-396; controls: 439 days, 95%CI, 364-513).   \n CONCLUSIONS Coinfection of HIV and HBV or HCV is frequently observed. Our results suggest that with prolonged survival of HIV-infected patients, coinfection with either HBV or HCV correlates with a reduced survival rate.", "output": "Hepatitis B and C in HIV-infected patients.

The use of these drugs for secondary prevention of CVD is well founded, but their expanding use in primary prevention\u2014in individuals without documented CVD\u2014has raised some concerns. Firstly, evidence suggests that, in primary prevention, statins substantially decrease CVD morbidity, but only moderately reduce CVD mortality. Secondly, long-term statin use might cause adverse effects, such as incident diabetes mellitus. Thirdly, the cost-effectiveness of such a strategy is unclear, and has to be balanced against the risk of 'overmedicating' the general population. Data clearly support the use of statins for primary prevention in high-risk individuals, in whom the strategy is cost-effective and the benefits exceed the risks. Whether primary prevention is beneficial in individuals at low or moderate risk is not certain. Therefore, the prescription of statins for primary prevention should be individualized on the basis of clinical judgment, particularly for low-risk individuals. In appropriately selected individuals, statins should also be used for primary prevention of ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic attack.", "output": "Statins in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

Insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and changes in the signaling of growth hormones and steroid hormones associated with diabetes may affect the risk of breast cancer. We reviewed epidemiologic studies of the association between type 2 diabetes and risk of breast cancer and the available evidence on the role of hormonal mediators of an association between diabetes and breast cancer. The combined evidence supports a modest association between type 2 diabetes and the risk of breast cancer, which appears to be more consistent among postmenopausal than among premenopausal women. Despite many proposed potential pathways, the mechanisms underlying an association between diabetes and breast cancer risk remain unclear, particularly because the 2 diseases share several risk factors, including obesity, a sedentary lifestyle, and possibly intake of saturated fat and refined carbohydrates, that may confound this association. Although the metabolic syndrome is closely related to diabetes and embraces additional components that might influence breast cancer risk, the role of the metabolic syndrome in breast carcinogenesis has not been studied and thus remains unknown.", "output": "Diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and breast cancer: a review of the current evidence.", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}]
