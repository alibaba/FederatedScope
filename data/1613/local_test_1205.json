What do you think of it ? \n Person2:  The city is small , not very modern , but there are many mountains with lots of trees around the city , so the air there is pretty fresh . \n Person1:       Did you go to the Summer Mountain Resort ? \n Person2:  Certainly ! The most attractive place is that , it's very large ; it is 8 times the size of Forbidden City and 16 times the size of Summer Palace . The art of gardens is perfectly represented in it . \n Person1:       It sounds great , and is it really cool there ? \n Person2:  Yes , I think the reason is that there is a big lake , and many trees in the Resort . \n Person1:       What is the special local product ? \n Person2:  The main product of Chende is various kinds of ferine mushroom and the almond . The mushroom tastes really good , and it is very different from the common mushrooms , and the snack made of almond is delicious . \n Person1:       I hope to go there someday .

Today we have more chances to try some new food because there are now many new form restaurants in our city coming from places all over the world .  \n Person2:  Also some traditional Chinese food , like noodles and dumpling are marketed in modern ways with improved food quality .

If we have to check our inventory with all our guys on overtime , you're looking at an increased cost of , I'd say , maybe 10 % . \n Person1:       Are you kidding ? \n Person2:  No , and let me tell you why ... If I make my guys stay over to check the inventory , I'll have to pay them at an overtime rate , which is time and a half . I estimate it will probably take 3 guys two hours to finish , that will be an increase on your labor fee by at least 10 % ... if you need the numbers that urgently , I can have them do it .
