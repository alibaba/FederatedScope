It's always packed in here & I'm not surprised! Quality food! Lots of options! I absolutely love the vegan options as well as the GMO-free foods (all Trader Joe's brand is GMO-free). I have to say the prices are greats as well! Love TJ's!!, Review_2: I love getting my Pirate Booty from here (the puffs people) and the ready made pizzas, pretty much everything that they have ready made is really good. The store can get pretty crowded, especially during the dinner hour rush. Employees are friendly and I recommend you take advantage of the samples throughout the store. Come hungry!, Review_3: This store gives me a nice and warm feeling. The feeling that I didn't and won't have with Walmart Market. Trader Joe's has a lot of eye-catching snacks and healthy food. Therefore, I have no idea which items I should buy. If I can, I want to try everything. Absolutely, comeback, Review_4: Checked out this location. Smaller than the Albuquerque NM store that we frequently visit but found the items we were needing but noticed selection was different or maybe I just wasn't finding what I needed. I didn't find the selection of jelly and jams that I wanted but that is okay., Review_5: Love this store... can't get enough of it. I have been going to Trader Joe's for years. This store always makes me happy. From great recepies idea to great selections of groceries. Staff is really friendly as well. Thumbs up Trader Joe on Camelback Rd!, Review_6: This is a big TJ's. What else is there to say? It's a Trader Joes. Awesome food, great employees. I don't know what I could complain about. Skip Fry's and shop here. The food is healthier and taste better., Review_7: The parking for this location can be a madhouse because it's located in a very busy strip mall and largely due to the construction surrounding it. But in TJ fashion, it won't disappoint with all the usual goodies that make you feel so adult and domesticated shopping here. Staff is always awesomely happy and helpful., Review_8: This is my favorite Joe's. From SF to SD to Scottsdale, the T & C location is the best. Everyone here genuinely knows me and my son. They interact with you like a friend. Products are always great and when they're not they exchange with no hassle. Thanks to the whole staff for always being so welcoming.", "output": "This Trader Joe's has a lot of healthy food and snacks. The food options include vegan foods, GMO-free foods, and ready made foods like pizza and snacks. The staff is friendly, happy, and helpful. At times it can be busy and crowded, but overall this Trader Joe's is highly recommended., The overall feel of the store was very pleasant. The employees were very nice, friendly and help with everything. Always have a very good selection of beers and other alcohol. They have a nice deli and plenty of fresh organic produce. They also offer very affordable prices on high quality grass-fed meat., nice staff and the store overall. more positive than negative feelings are prevalent. the parking can be a problem at times, also the size is not very big.", "category": "Summarization 1299.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a set of reviews from Amazon and Yelp.

Have trouble with my feet: neuromas, plantar fasciitis, and bunion. Looking for comfortable cushioned for quick trips to run errands without putting on sneakers and sneakers. These work great for me but not for all day use., Review_2: The shoe is so comfortable and I bought another 'walking' shoe by Ahnu which is perfect too.Needed a cute and comfy shoe to do lots of walking in Europe this Spring. These will fit the bill.I found this style was a little big so I had to get a half size smaller and it is great.LO, Review_3: Reviews said to buy a size smaller. I wear a 7 so ordered the 6.5. It was still too big, and I'm guessing a 6 would fit. I bought the Ahnu sandal at 6.5 and it fit perfectly. I plan to reorder the shoe but in a size 6., Review_4: I always take a 7 or 7.5, in fact own a pair of flipflops from this brand in a 7, decided to order 7.5 and it fits more like a 8.5 or even a 9. Way too large. Am returning & hope to replace with a smaller size., Review_5: I would recommend these shoes to anyone looking for a very comfortable walking shoe with some style. I can wear these instead of sneakers for less casual events. The shoes run big. I normally wear a 7 1 / 2, but ended up with the 7 which fit just right., Review_6: I ordered these shoes in a half size smaller than my regular size due to reviews that I read, but they were still too small. They were pretty shoes, so was very disappointed. The company was very good about refunding my money very quickly., Review_7: I don't believe these shoes will fit anyone who wears a narrow. If I order my true size, they're too short and my toes hit the front of the shoe yet if I order the next size up they're too wide yet my toes still hit in the same place. Both pairs went back -- bummer!, Review_8: I am in and out of areas where the footing can be slippery. I wanted a cute but totally functional shoe and this is it. Incredibly lightweight! I bet I could run in these. Great all around casual working shoe.", "output": "This is the perfect \"comfy shoe,\" great for walking around town or casual get togethers. Cute and functional!  They do run a bit big, plan to order them 1/2-1 size smaller than usual. Another very comfortable shoe by Ahnu, would definitely buy again!, A comfortable, stylish, casual walking shoe. When doing a lot of walking this shoe is a great alternative to sneakers. However, the sizing is off. They run too large and too wide. Sizing down 1 or 2 sizes allows for a better fit. The company will replace or refund quickly due to sizing issues., These are very comfortable, quality shoes that can be worn casually. They are functional and incredibly light-weight. However, the shoes tend to run a bit large. Overall, this quality product is recommended.", "category": "Summarization 1299.json"}]
