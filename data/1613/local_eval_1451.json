An example should suffice.", "output": "To me, the nouns pledge and vow are closer in meaning, to the point of being synonyms. They mean 'a solemn promise' (this is NOAD's main definition for both). Oath, while close in meaning, typically has an additional sense of invoking the divine (e.g., an oath taken on the bible). A verb with close meaning to all three is to swear. In addition to this meaning of 'solemn promise', each of these three nouns has specific additional meanings. an oath maybe refer to a profanity or a swear word vows maybe have specific meaning of commiting oneself to a given life, e.g. marriage or monastic vows pledge has an additional legal meaning, synonymous to surety, bond or guarantee", "category": "Question Answering 853.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate the answer for a given question.

Is there a word in the English language that contains every vowel (and preferably 'y')?.", "output": "I totally rule at Clockwords by using sequoia and facetiously. Wikipedia used to have a list of words containing all the vowels, but the article has since been deleted. Some of the fun facts it mentioned included: The word Iouea, a genus of sea sponges, contains all five regular vowels and no other letters. [...] There are many words that feature all five regular vowels occurring only once in alphabetical order, the most common being abstemious and facetious. [...] Considering y as a vowel, the suffix -ly can be added to a number of these words; thus the shortest word containing six unique vowels in alphabetical order is aeriously, with nine letters (OED)[.]", "category": "Question Answering 853.json"}, {"instruction": "Generate the answer for a given question.

Can both be used interchangeably when talking about an official (public) list of items, records?.", "output": "The online oxford dict says: Register noun official list or record, for example of births, marriages, and deaths, of shipping, or of historic places. a book or record of attendance, for example of students in a class or school or guests in a hotel. Registry: noun (plural registries) a place or office where registers or records are kept. But yeah, it also says that a registry too can mean a list. And I think 'Registry' is used more in the former context than the later. Even while talking in context of computers we say things like 'Windows Registry'. For me, the word register brings along a sense of being finite but registry does not. like when I think of a register of records, I usually get a quantified picture of the records list comes to my mind, like a page, or a notebook. but 'registry' brings along a picture of non quantifiable !! or its just weird with me. Anyone have other thoughts on this?", "category": "Question Answering 853.json"}]
