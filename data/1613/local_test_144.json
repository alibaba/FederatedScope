The Missus is a cardiac surgeon while I work as a software engineer at a pretty big firm. Needless to say, finances aren\u2019t an issue for us.\n\nNow I\u2019m of the opinion that my kids\u2019 primary focus should be their education right now. They don\u2019t have/need jobs (besides sometimes part-time during the summer), but the wife and I pretty much pay for everything. As such, the kids just expected that we would pay for their college, which honestly, was a reasonable expectation. The problem lies with our daughter: she wants to major in Comparative Literature or something related to writing. Her reasoning is that she loves writing and she\u2019s good at it.\n\nI\u2019m a bit hesitant to just pay for unconditional college. If her goal was to be a writing professor, or just had a specific career goal in mind in general, I\u2019d be a lot more willing. But as it stands, her primary motivator was just because it interests her. I told her that I\u2019m fine paying for education, on the condition that she majored in something more \u201cpractical\u201d. Or that if she had a legitimate plan to get from what she\u2019s majoring to what she wants to do, then I\u2019d be happy to pick up the tuition and living expenses, which means she just needs to pay for her own food. If she doesn\u2019t that\u2019s fine, but she\u2019d have to find a way to supplement her education through loans and scholarships (and I will help her do this).  \n\nShe accused me of trying to manipulate her. Truth be told, I did try to push STEM to her when she was 15-16, but she consistently brought home Bs-high Cs in stem while getting perfect As to A+s in writing. I conceded that she was just naturally a better writer, and I\u2019ll let her develop her own issues. She\u2019s using this information from the past to claim I\u2019m trying to manipulate her into doing a field that I want her to do.\n\nMy POV is, I don\u2019t necessarily care if she does a field in STEM. She can get her Underwater Basket Weaving degree IF she planned to, for example, be a lawyer (and thus has an actual use for the degree), but she can\u2019t just major in something because she \u201clikes\u201d it.

I had been living with just my mom before this and I didn't pay rent and she bought me clothes/groceries/anything else. I did a lot of chores whenever I was told because of course she was providing for me. Now me and my boyfriend both pay 1/3 of the rent each at this new place. My mom pays her 1/3 and the utilities. I buy all of my own clothes and groceries and anything else I want. My mom and I have a rocky relationship due to many reasons.\n\nWhen I was a kid she met a man who became my stepdad and lived with us for 10 years. He was VERY emotionally abusive. He was constantly yelling at me for everything. He would tell me I was stupid, fat, make fun of my acne and my makeup. He was always telling me my opinion didn't matter since I was not an adult. He punched a hole in my bedroom door, threw my lamp against the wall when he was mad at me, broke my phone when I didn't do my chores, I was grounded every  other week for something cleaning related. I was treated like a maid and punished if I didn't do everything after school or didn't do it good enough. One time he made me do his laundry and I got yelled at and called an idiot when I folded his pants \"wrong\". He always told me he would \"beat my ass\" if only my mom would let him. He would smoke in the car and I would get called names when I said something about the smoke blowing back into my face. I had to hear him yell at my mom every night when he got drunk and ripped her favorite purse apart, or tried to rip her wedding ring off her finger. I had to hear him beat our family dog after he ignored him asking to go outside to pee. He made me live in fear of the next time I would be punished. I still immediately shut down when I hear someone yell. Through all of this my mom stood by and watched. For 10 years. She gets annoyed when I bring up any of this. Like I'm supposed to forget about it and never mention it, just so she doesn't feel guilty for not doing anything. She gaslights me when I mention some stuff. I don't think I can ever forgive her for standing by all those years. She divorced him when I was 17. But now she is back with him, going on dates and vacations, staying over at his house. I guess I can't say I didn't expect it but it just makes me feel so bad. He texted me the other day and said him and my mom decided that \"we\" are having thanksgiving dinner at his house this year. I told him \"I can't, I'm going to \\[boyfriend's\\] parent's\", and he called me a \"fucking brat\" to my mom. She agreed with him. I'm so over being treated poorly by both of them. \n\nWhen they were broken up she would go from guy to guy and they would always be put before me. She would go stay at their houses for days when I was still in high school and lived at home. She would go to their/their family's house for every holiday and leave me alone. One time I cried and begged her to stay home and spend time with me, but she refused. This is when our relationship really began to get cold and distant. When I went to college she NEVER asked me how school was going. I would get in the car when she picked me up for weekends/breaks and she would immediately start talking about her boyfriend, what fancy place they were going to this weekend, what food her work provided for her that day. If I brought up something relating to my classes/my life she really just wasn't interested. I would see my friend's/boyfriend's parents being interested in their lives, asking about school and grades and how they were feeling. This hurt me so bad that my mom doesn't care about me like that. I struggled with some very bad depression my first years of college, and I broke down and cried and told her I was depressed and I felt like she didn't love me or care about me and I needed help. Her response was to turn it around and say pretty much \"I guess I'm a terrible mother and you hate me\". She couldn't even try to pretend like she was interested in my life. She is still this way but I have since given up any hope that she will care (I have told her more times how I felt since then and it always ends the same way) and our relationship has gotten even more cold. I got a new job a few months ago and she has seriously never once talked to me about it.\n\nWhen we all moved into this apartment I thought it would be fine. I thought we could just be roommates, whatever. Well first she claims the driveway as her own even though we pay our fair share. We are never allowed to park our car there, we have to park in the visitor lot and walk to the apartment. Okay, she pays utilities I guess. She invited my sister over to spend the night when my sister didn't have a car one time, telling her that she would drive her home the next day. So my sister, her boyfriend, and her kid come over. Her and her boyfriend make out in the living all night, they leave their trash around the apartment, they leave their dirty dishes everywhere, they eat my groceries that I pay for when I didn't expect to have guests over and I have a weekly grocery budget to stick to. The next day she doesn't want to drive them. They are here for 3 days before someone can finally drive them. And I get told that I'm selfish and treating my sister poorly for asking them to please not eat my groceries. I'm not the one who invited them over. I told my mom that I pay the rent here and I have a say in things. She pretty much told me that I don't have a say and to get over it. \n\nThat's the final straw. I thought I would finally be treated like an adult with a say in anything since we all moved in together and we are all paying rent. We yelled at each other the other day because she is trying to give me \"chores\" to do. Now, I am perfectly okay with cleaning. It's my house that I live in too, of course I'm going to clean it. But she is trying to assign me chores that she wants me to have done and I get \"in trouble\" if I don't do them. I don't want to be treated like I'm a kid who doesn't pay rent. Me and my boyfriend do a fair amount of cleaning. We both work 20-30 hours a week and have school for \\~15 hours a week. We are busy and we still do our fair amount of cleaning. \n\nAt this point I have had enough. We are constantly arguing and I'm done being treated like a kid when I pay rent and pay for all of the stuff I need. I am disgusted that she is back with the man who abused me and ruined my teen years. I barely even see her as my mom anymore. She's more like an annoying roommate. I am going to see an apartment on Saturday. I would be moving out at the beginning of December. I can't help but feel guilty though. If we move out then she would have to pay an extra $850 a month. I feel extra bad that it's around Christmas time. I know that she can afford the apartment on her own. She spends a lot of money on random things she wants, like clothes and shoes, so she would just not be living quite as comfortably. She is always shopping. I also have not even told her yet that I'm thinking about moving because I don't know how she will react. She will probably be angry and I do not want to spend the rest of my time here getting treated like shit. I don't even think she wants to live with me either since she told my (ex)stepdad that I'm an ungrateful brat and she can't wait to live alone. The money is the only thing I feel bad about.

In the same back seat he was just sitting in, but for some reason he is sitting in the front driver seat. \n\nFast forward to us finishing up the account and leaving, I am the last out because I have alarms to set. I get in the car and see my boyfriend pick up a cigarette that had been set on the dashboard after probably 2 hits and burned down to the filter... We both look at the dash to see a nasty melted gouge. Dee asked Jay if he was smoking in the front seat of the car... No was the response he got. We both look at the cigarette and sure enough Marlboro on the filter, (Dee smokes Newports and I dont smoke at all) Jay smokes marlboros. He asked again, this isn't your MARLBORO cigarette that burned up on my dash? Again no. \nAt this point Dee is so angry he asks Jay to get out the car and ride with another team member to our last account. Jay exits and we sit for a second to take in the situation. \n\nDee is furious, I get it, he is trying to sell his car, the interior had no damage up until this point. I try talking him down and eventually he does, although he does not want my friend back in his vehicle without an apology or the cash to replace the dash. Not so unreasonable, well Jay decides he is going to avoid Dee, I get it, Dee is pissed. \n\nFast forward again, time to go, I was under the impression my other team member would take Jay home, he had messaged me on fb and said he would either ask or uber home. Come to find out he walked an hour and a half home despite the options he had. To add to this he posted on snapchat about how he has to walk home because people are \"childish\" and \"petty\". I am pissed when I find this out, because I find out later from my boss and another coworker. \n\nWhen Dee and I leave I saw Jay had left his food in the car...or rather in my boyfriend's daughter's car seat directly, and the plate on the floor, I try to hastily clean it up but no, Dee saw it and he came to the back seat to look for more, and starts pulling empty marlboro packs, Naked juice bottles, wadded up paper towel used to clean up some kind of red spill and more garbage from under the seat. These are obvi from my best friend because as I have said before neither of us smoke Marlboros and I know my boyfriend doesn't drink Naked. At this point there is nothing I can do to make Dee reconsider Jay riding with him.\n\nNow I have Jay telling me over Facebook messages that he will make his own way to work. \n\nOk then.\n\nOn Friday we started a brand new account, so both of my bosses as well as the regional leader is with us. I get to work with Dee and my boss asks where Jay is, I told her what he told me, he was making his own way, then I hear about the snapchat posts, personally I dont use snap but when I was shown the snaps I wanted to snap. My boss calls him and he states we just left him. Now I'm really pissed. My boss leaves to go get him and I tuck my anger down for a later conversation with my best friend. \n\nUnfortunately we had no time to hash things out right away so I figured at the next account we would sit down and talk. No dice, he asks my boss to take him BACK home, completely behind my back, to the point that I didnt know he was leaving until I got to the next account. I message him asking why he would do this, he tells me he's not getting in between me and my boyfriend, I told him this is not the case, there is nothing I can do for him concerning Dee and his car and how he should've come to him as a man and apologize. Jay goes on about how important Dee is to me and how this isn't my problem and he will do what he has to do from this point. I said yeah Dee is important to me, but so are you so man tf up and talk to this man before he decides he doesn't want an apology anymore.\n\nThe whole weekend goes by and Jay says nothing to me, we live in the same house yet had no interaction, so when today rolls around I do what I always do, get my things together and wait for Dee to call me and say he is here. When I leave I see Jay's room has no light and did not see him elsewhere in the house so I assumed he was already gone and leave. Minutes after leaving, I get a text saying how he wanted to apologize and how could we just leave him behind...\n\nThis is where I snapped, I told him straight up that I didnt even know he was in the house and if he really wanted to apologize to Dee he would've either asked me for his contact info over the weekend or been on point watching for him to pull into the driveway. Personally if it were me and my job on the line I wouldn't have bothered with shoes I would've gotten out there to speak my peace. He gets sassy with me about his walk home, and I told him he walked home because he wanted to, he could've just as easily apologized or asked the other team member (she was actually pissed he didn't ask her). I told him straight up that his priorities were screwed up and he needs to grow up and take responsibility for his choices, and that people aren't going to wait around to hold his hand through things. \n\nThen I started in on his snapchat posts I was getting hounded about by our office gossips who were trying to get all the juicy details of the story...\n\nI asked him if Dee was petty for bringing him to work everyday without asking for gas money or even getting a thank you in return, yes he comes for me because I'm his girlfriend but in all reality he doesn't have to bring my friend too. Was my boyfriend petty every time he made pit stops so you could get your cigarettes or liquor, or take you to the store? I got no answers to this question, so I told him I wasn't going to be a member of his pity party. He states he didn't want a pity party, and I told him obvi you want pity cause you asked for it all over snapchat where our co workers can see and continue to message me about. \n\nI'm not sorry for telling him to grow up and be a man (hes 32) but I do wonder if I am an asshole in this.\n", "output": "having no sympathy for my best friend", "category": "Title Generation 1127.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, generate a suitable title that describes the main event/root cause of the situation.

We were neighbors throughout HS, went to college together, and shared an apartment our last year there. He\u2019s been a brother our whole lives; we\u2019re both an only child. We\u2019ve talked about how we\u2019ll be each other\u2019s best man for as long as I can remember. I don\u2019t really have any friends other than him; I\u2019m not very social.\n\n2 years ago I met the love of my life, FIANC\u00c9. 1 year into the relationship, FRIEND meets FIANC\u00c9\u2019S best friend, MOH (Maid of Honor). FRIEND and MOH start dating. FIANC\u00c9 and I both agreed that this might cause complications in our relationship if they have problems, but also acknowledged that we couldn\u2019t really do anything about it. What were we gonna do, tell them they can\u2019t date? They were great together, and MOH found him worth giving up \u201cwaiting until marriage.\u201d A few months ago, I proposed, and we are set to be married in a little over a month. I asked FRIEND to be my best man. FIANC\u00c9 asked MOH to be Maid of Honor.\n\n2 weeks ago, FRIEND went out with some other friends, and ended up drunk and going home with a girl. He confessed this to me the next day, and he felt like absolute shit. I told him he\u2019s gotta confess it to MOH. He fucked up and it\u2019s only fair to her, and she\u2019ll be a lot more understanding if he tells her himself. He agrees this is the right thing to do.\n\nMOH\u2018s livid (rightfully so). I come home from work and she\u2018s at my apartment. She packed a bag and asked FIANC\u00c9 if she could stay with us to get out of her apartment. I\u2019m fine with this; I can understand she\u2019s going through a rough time. 1 week ago, MOH decided she can\u2019t handle dating anymore, and they break up. She\u2018s staying with us until she can find another apartment.\n\nFIANC\u00c9 tells me that there\u2019s no way MOH will be able to handle being at the wedding, especially walking down the aisle with FRIEND. I told her that they don\u2019t need to walk down together, or do anything together, but I can\u2019t tell him he can\u2019t be my best man. It would devastate both of us, as well as leaving me without a best man. FIANC\u00c9 tells me I shouldn\u2019t even want to be friends with him anymore, and offers her brother as my best man. She put her foot down on him even being AT the wedding. She says that one of them can\u2019t be there, and that it\u2019s not fair for MOH to both get cheated on, and then ALSO not able to go to the wedding because we \u201cchose\u201d FRIEND over her.\n\nFRIEND is already devastated that he fucked up his relationship. I hate cheaters, but you don\u2019t just turn on your lifelong best friend because he fucked up.

We're all a part of the same friend group, we all knew each other through school growing up, and I also knew my ex-boyfriend (of 6 years) from that friend group. It's been a few years (I dated my fiance shortly after we broke up), but I know he's not over me; I'll get texts still whenever he's out drinking, and he's expressed that it's hard for him to see me moving on with my fiance even years later.

Like, I think it's been way too long for him to still be hung up on me, and while I could have had the social another day, it's my wedding and it's not like I need to cater to his feelings just because he can't move on.

I met my friend (24, male (let's call him Brian)) at school in 2010 and we've been hanging out together regularly ever since. I would pretty much consider myself as a very emotional, caring person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo basically, everything was great until we got our A-Levels. We would still hang out a lot but it wasn't like the time we've been hanging out at school. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe got into lots of arguments, as most of people in friendships do, which is very normal to me. I always approached him with what I didn't like and vice versa. The problem here is that I was always trying my best to not hurt him and avoid the things that would annoy him. He wouldn't do the same for me. He would try to provoke me every now and then even though he knew that certain things hurt me. I confronted him with this and he said that he's sorry and that he would stop it. He didn't. I learned to ignore it so it was fine after a while.  \n\n\nHe told me, that he really wanted to try weed at one point. I said that it's his decision but I advised him to thoroughly consider trying it in first place but also be careful where to get it from. So, one day he would invite 2 friends he met on the internet via online gaming to a sleepover LAN party. I got invited but I didn't really want to go at that point. So at the day, I was with another friend and he said 'How's Brian doing and I said that he was fine. He really wanted to see Brian so we called and asked if it was fine when we joined and he said he'd love us to come over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe arrive there and he's wasted af. The other 2 guys are listening to music VERY loudly while he is there lying on the couch looking really horrible. I'm concerned about him and ask what happened. He tells me that he tried weed and he feels miserable. After finding out that he hadn't eaten anything that day I decide to go to the kitchen and cook something for him as the other guys seemingly don't care. After that, I tell him to rest and the other guys to be quieter so that he can rest. We haven't talked about this day ever since, he didn't even say thanks for being there for me or anything like that.  \n\n\nOne day, I asked him about doing sports together. He is a good looking, athletic guy while I am overweight and have anxiety issues. I told him that it would boost my motivation if he went to the gym with me. He said that he didn't like gyms that much and didn't want to go. That was completely fine by me as I can't force anyone into anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward, we would meet with 2 other guys (also met via online gaming) and have a nice time together. One of them proceeds to ask Brian if he wanted to join them doing sports at the gym and Brian immediately says yes. I'm obviously a little confused because our conversation about gyms was not that long ago. He looks me in the eye while agreeing and doesn't even ask me if I wanted to join as well. I'm really hurt but manage to forget it.  \n\n\nRecently, I asked him about something I wanted to buy and he told me that he knows someone who would get discounts and that he could ask them if I want. I agree. After one week of messaging him and him leaving my messages on read but not answering I decide to tell him that I don't want the discount anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm really pissed because of the fact that all the time it was me trying to keep the friendship alive and to maintain contact. He would never message me on his own. All the times I confronted him with things that go wrong he would always reply with the same things, almost like a playback. I felt replaced.  \n\n\nSo, at the end of the day, I decided that I would act like him and not contact him anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the Asshole because I can't take this shit anymore and don't want to be hurt anymore?", "output": "keeping the distance to my friend", "category": "Title Generation 1127.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, generate a suitable title that describes the main event/root cause of the situation.

Thought that was that. Two days ago, I found that they\u2019re friends again and they\u2019ve been exchanging conversation. \n\nMy husband and I have been married for 2 years, and I am 8 weeks pregnant. He is in a management role at at a local large gas station/convenience store. Last fall, I found out that he was exchanging Snapchats with a young coworker, who was 17 years old at the time. I told him that I was wildly uncomfortable with their contact and that it was inappropriate. He told me that it wasn\u2019t like that, that it was kind of weird but that he felt bad for her because she doesn\u2019t have a lot of friends. (I\u2019m not sure how true this is because she post some pretty risqu\u00e9/sexy photos online.)\n\nFast forward to Christmas, and we are with his family. I bring up the issue to his sister and husband because we are very close with them and I trust their opinions. They both agreed with me, telling him he needed to stop what he was doing immediately. He said he deleted her on Snapchat and I thought it was done. \n\nFast forward to about 3 weeks ago, my husband and I join an xbox live party with a couple of my husband\u2019s coworkers, not knowing that this teenage girl was one of them. She doesn\u2019t say a word and immediately signs off. I find out after some probing that she\u2019s been upset about my husband deleting her and that he blamed his cutting contact entirely on me. He did this by telling her that he deleted her because I was uncomfortable. I was pretty unfazed by this because it apparently wasn\u2019t affecting their work relationship so I figured she\u2019d get over not being Snapchat buddies. \n\nTwo days ago, my husband is in the shower. My husband\u2019s phone starts ringing. I look and see it\u2019s a telemarketer so I double click the lock button to end the call and see a Snapchat from coworker on the lock screen. Immediately, I\u2019m furious. I go to the bathroom and say, \u201cI don\u2019t know whether to be angry with you or furious right now.\u201d He asks what I\u2019m talking about and I tell him what I saw. He goes silent for a moment and then says, \u201cShe added me back. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I walk out and he finishes his shower. He comes out to get dressed and again says he\u2019s sorry and that he\u2019s a piece of shit. I didn\u2019t really acknowledge him because I was still so upset. \n\nI\u2019ve taken the last two days to think and I can\u2019t begin to understand why this girl is so important to have a friendship with. I trust my husband completely and I know that he hasn\u2019t been unfaithful because he literally has no time to be. He\u2019s always either at work, at school, or at home with me. \n\nI told him today that I\u2019m upset and we would talk about this when he gets home from work tonight.

I treasure the few that I have, but in the last year, I got pretty fed up with what was my best friend of more than 20 years. I've always treated her and her family like my own family and I started to feel like our hospitality was being taken advantage of when she and her husband and kids would come over, both she and her husband would get wasted, so we always insisted that they stay over. Thing is, they have a history of driving drunk with their kids in tow, and despite voicing my concerns, they always waved me off. So problem solved if I make them stay, right? Nope. They wake up in the morning and immediately begin administering the \"hair of the dog\" remedy (not a real cure, I know) and wind up wasted all over again. By the time they finally go home, it's often evening the next day and their kids have demolished my house, my friend and husband never insisted on the kids helping with the cleanup, and I'm so frustrated with the amount of cleaning I have to do just to get my house back to halfway livable. I know I can ask them to help, but they're so drunk things tend to be hastily shoved under beds and in cabinets, not where they belong. I feel inclined to say that when we visit their home, this is not what I do. I clean up their kitchen, put food away, ask my kids to put things away, etc. The state of their house is in better condition than when we arrived. Now part of my issue with the drinking is that I no longer drink due to having a drinking problem in the past. I notice the annoying drunken behavior much more now that I'm not drinking, but don't want to sound like I'm better than them for not drinking. It bothers me though, and I've tried to bring up the subject in a subtle way, suggesting that they cut back on consuming so much alcohol. It's quickly dismissed. The last straw was when they came over to celebrate my birthday, and my friend showed up at my door already blitzed. She tried to downplay how much she was consuming by continuously \"checking on her car\". It was obvious she had a bottle in her car. I ended up so annoyed at the reckless mess (food being dropped on the floor and stared at without cleaning it up, repetitive conversation, etc.) that I went to bed early. The next day was the usual wake and drink routine, and when I walked out to my driveway, I noticed a wet spot on the asphalt next to her car and the overwhelming smell of pee. Not sure who squatted to pee in my driveway, but it may have happened during one of the many \"car checks\". That was it. I pretty much just stopped talking to them after that, and I haven't given any explanation about why, mostly because I know the truth would fall on deaf ears and cause substantial embarrassment that would probably result in resentment towards me. Also, in a way, I don't feel like it should be be my responsibility to spell out how inappropriate and rude they've been. They're grown adults, and should know better. \n\nMy other friend was a good friend who I've opened my doors to when he needed help. He doesn't have much family or friends, and I've often been the only one who would talk to him. He has a history of drug and alcohol abuse, which he was candid about, and having been in his situation before, I could understand his situation without judging. The last couple of times he visited though, his drinking was out of control and he ended up saying really awful things to me, and having inappropriate conversations with not only my kids, but other people's kids who were staying over. He had no recollection of the previous night, so how do you chew someone out for something they don't remember?  He knows he has a problem, so what's the point? Same thing, I pretty much just abruptly stopped talking to him. \n\nI feel justified in cutting ties with both parties, especially since my kids don't need to be exposed to this kind of behavior, but wonder if I'm being cowardly in not tell them why I stopped answering texts/phone calls. Do I owe an explanation? These are both friends I've known since I was a teenager. Does that factor in a certain amount of responsibility on my part to be a good friend and lay it all out?

I just stated the situation, how it affects me, and asked if he knew how I should personally handle the situation (callback to the strict no-smoking policy).

We first met on the xbox 360 in 2007 and had a group of me, him, and another friend.\n\n after i built my computer in 2016 the friend we would talk to would start to slowly talk less and less with my ex boyfriend. and now he completely stopped talking to him because everytime we would talk or play my ex would become upset and negative for really small reasons, like getting killed in a game, or because i would talk with my friend and he felt excluded, i would try to make him talk and include him in everything we would do because i know how it feels to be left out.\n\n in 2017 he asked me out and i said yes. for the next 2 months it was great, sometimes he would break down, or his mom would become hostile towards him for something really minor, like he would clean his room but he missed a dust spot behind a desk.  i didn't mind and understood that he had some problems, and that his parents could be abusive at times, i would comfort him and tell him that what his parents were doing are wrong. and to keep seeing his therapist so he can manage and improve himself. \n\n As a kid he would get constantly spoiled by his mom, She would get him whatever he wanted, he would occasionally brag about what he had when we were on Xbox and since me and my friend were poor we would tell him we can't, but he would keep doing that. i admit that i was mean to him on the Xbox and used to make him rage since it was funny when i was 11 at the time and didn't know he had Aspergers. i feel bad about doing that now and have said sorry for it, he forgives me and said that he would've done the same if he was me.\n\nAs we were dating i was always a yes man to everything, and if he had an opinion that i didn't agree with i would lie and go along with it because i was afraid to lose him. if i was feeling depressed or anxious i would lie and said that i was okay because i didn't want him to be sad or worried about me, he figured out that i was lying and got really mad at me and would yell at me because i lied. after that i would stop being so much of a yes man, and slowly started to improve myself, i still have trouble being honest about my feelings and would still sometimes lie because most of the time i'm sad, and scared about my future. i told him this and he understood, but to be honest to him and to be more open.\n\n Since he was young he had to move state to state because of his parents and he never really developed any long lasting friendships with kids at school because of it. and when he did he made friendships with some girls when he was younger and would tell me that after he asked some out, they would eventually stop talking to him, and one even becoming hostile to him too. He told me that his worst nightmare was if i were to leave him like my friend left him after almost a decade of talking to him, and that he doesn't want to lose me because of his disabilities. after he told me this he started to become more and more anxious about me. and this is about the time he slowly started to try and control me. \n\nAbout 4 months in he would start to become upset and breakdown almost every single night for about 3 months, I would help him for as long as he was upset because i deeply care about him, he would get upset because of his family and because of his friend leaving him and how he has mental issues. no matter how late or long it took i was there for him and he was grateful for that. and when i got upset or scared he would help me too and be there for me. but then he just started to get upset over me saying cute things to my cat. or because my family started to talk to me for 3 minutes. he started to breakdown and cry and called me the worst girlfriend because i had to rake the leaves for 5 minutes. \n\nOne night he was upset for over 3 hours because he wanted me to love him as much as i used to when we first started to date, he wanted me to stay home all the time and say cute things to him constantly. and if i went out to get dinner, or if i wanted to talk to my friend he would cry and beg me not to. and when i had to go to the doctors for a checkup he almost broke down because i had to enter the office and he wanted to keep talking to me.  through the months i have been giving him chances and telling him that i can't take the controlling aspect of the relationship, and how he would get upset over literally nothing sometimes. he understood and started to work on himself because he was afraid of losing me like he lost his friends. i would still get annoyed from him getting upset when i was just playing with my cat for 5 minutes while he was making himself food.  \n\nAbout a year in i started to not be as affectionate as i used to, i would still say cute things because i cared and would try my best to help him when he was upset, but i felt so tired of it. i tried my hardest to be affectionate but i was drained. at this point i've been only texting my friend for about 8 months and he was about to end our friendship because of my ex. i didn't want that because he has been the only one that i know of to never get mad, or cry over something small. he helped me through everything that happened between me and my ex.\n\n I have made mistakes and have gotten annoyed too in the past, and i have been unfair. but i couldn't take his stress and anxiety and yelling anymore. before we started to date i was depressed, stressed, and scared for the future, i still am but i tried my best to make him happy and to help him out. but when i wanted to talk to my sister or go get a coffee i would be too afraid to ask him because i didn't want him to cry, or beg me not to. \n\nOver the months my own family started to notice the stress and how everytime i wanted to go somewhere i couldn't because he would get upset. they didn't think it was a healthy relationship. even his own friends would notice, like when i had to rake the leaves i said i would be back but he started to get anxious and he didn't want me to go. his friend said that it would be okay and that i would be back and to calm down. or when me and my ex were playing fortnite and he was mad, one of his friends started to discuss politics and he thought we excluded him, even though he didn't want to say anything because he was mad i would still ask his opinion on topics because i didn't want him to be and then he still got upset.\n\nThe night i broke up with him he broke down. he has told me in the past that if i were to break up with him he would commit suicide and has cut himself on the thumb for very minor things in the past. So i waited for his parents to come home to say it to him. He didn't do anything that night but got upset because my sister said hi and how is it going, and that is when i had enough. \n\nHe became delusional on the same night, he called me at about 3 am because he couldn't fall asleep and i tried to help him. but when i told him that i broke up with him he would say that we were not and that i was 'just taking a break' i told him that he can find someone better than me and that he deserves someone better than me but he said 'why would i cheat on you since we are still together'\n\nI feel bad for breaking up with him because i still care for him and know that he has problems, but he has had so many months and chances to fix himself. I told him that i still want to be his friend and that i still care about him, but that i want my own freedom and to be able to talk to my sister. \n\nI feel like i have been going insane for the past 8 months and i don't know who is wrong. i think its both our fault and i want to know what you guys think. I'm still trying to improve my self and im starting to look up therapist to go to. Sorry for the long post but i wanted to make sure everything was explained to the best of my abilities.\n\nplease tell me if i could improve on anything so that i way i know in the future.\n\n thank you for reading.

I'm currents in the midst of my first year at college, and I live in a suite style room. So for reference this is a shared common space with a bunch of other room which can be either single or double. So I'm pretty good friends with 5 of my 6 suite-mates, and we all want to live together next year is the same situation.  The other guy is just very shy and doesn't come out much. So, fast forward a bit I meet my friend in question, let's call him Tyler. So Tyler is a good guy, but he can be a little much at times. It seems like he has really high standards for what is clean and what isn't. For context, I'm extremely messy, so that's one thing I thought would be a little much for Tyler. Tyler also isn't the most agreeable guy at times which in small doses doesn't bother me very much, but can get annoying at times. My suite mates echo this sentiment as well. So we decided it would be best that, we not live with Tyler for fear of his idiosyncrasies causing resentment between us and him. Tyler has been struggling recently with some outside factors, and though he hasn't explicitly stated it I'm sure he has some other mental issues as well. In short he's had a pretty hard life and bares the scars at times. \n\n  \n\nSo about 3 weeks ago one of the members of my suite mates and Tyler had a mini falling out, and we thought he hated us for a while. So we went ahead and asked another guy who we knew pretty well if he wanted to room with us. He said yes, and that was it. I tried really hard to reconnect with Tyler and eventually did. He started hanging out in our suite again and everything was back to normal. Fast forward about a week and Tyler texted my suite mate, if he still needed another guy in the suite. He told him that we already found someone else, and Tyler was fuming. Since then he hasn't talked to any of us. I even see him in the halls, and he ignores me. If he seems me taking the stairs, he'll take the elevator to avoid me. I still want to be friends with Tyler just not his roommate. If you need any additional context just ask in the comments, and I'd be more than happy to respond.

We share a lot of the same opinions, so I'm not criticizing their beliefs, but I mean they're very sensitive and use words they saw a post about, and this often ends with them calling any relationship where they and their partner break up as \"abusive\" and \"toxic\".\n\nI'm an abuse victim in several different ways, so the first time this happened I was horrified and asked B about it all, and they essentially just came back with \"Well they were passive aggressive a lot\" which I totally get is toxic behavior, but so far ever past relationship they've been in is now deemed \"abusive\". Even relationships where B was fine at first with them breaking up are now deemed abusive. Now, B has a good idea of what abuse is as their parents were pretty emotionally distant and their dad was downright emotionally manipulative, but the things B has deemed abuse in their romantic relationships is completely ridiculous. \n\nOn top of this, over the past few years they've also gained more and more mental illnesses, and now I think they say they have DID, BPD, PTSD, Bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, the list goes on. I try to leave this topic where it is because I'm not going to try and analyze someone's personal life like this, but people with BPD typically have issues with relationships and B refuses to accept that their partners aren't abusive for being a furry (literally an argument) and that the unsteady nature of their relationships could be because of their BPD.\n\nWhile that's all frustrating, they also use the words trauma very liberally, and say they understand it very well but have some faulty ideals about it. I can remember one time I was talking about a character from a game we both played that was traumatized and angry, and I said I liked him because I could relate to the feeling. B started talking about how awful he was, how he was mean and a bad person, and I replied that he was obviously traumatized. B got defensive and said they KNEW how trauma worked, and they knew that's why of course, but they still thought he was bad. Weird thing to be offended by on my part, of course, but this was just the most recent example. B labels a lot of things trauma (one of their exes, The Furry, made them a fursona, so now any mention of fursonas is traumatic for B) yet often fails to recognize trauma in anyone else except really personal and common things for them.\n\nAm I the asshole for being angry about this?", "output": "being annoyed with my friends liberal use of the words \"trauma\" and \"abuse\"", "category": "Title Generation 1127.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, generate a suitable title that describes the main event/root cause of the situation.

Background: every other weekend I drive a total of about 3 hours to pick up my son. It's a 2 lane highway, speed limit is 65 until you get to a town (there are 2, the one I come from and the one I'm going to). This is not a busy highway, it's a straight, boring desert highway.\n\nA couple of months ago my fiance was driving and had the cruise set to 65. That is what we both always do. There are state troopers out there and they absolutely will pull you over. As usual, everyone was passing us. They always do. But this one truck came around us and as it did, the passenger leaned out his window, threw a plastic bottle at our windshield, and flipped us off. Like i said we get passed a lot, but no one has ever done anything like that (or honked or anything). We figured we just weren't going fast enough for their liking.\n\nNow I'm wondering though, are we assholes for driving the speed limit when almost no one else is? My state does not have any kind of rule about keeping up with traffic, as I'm aware some places do. And it's not like we have 50 cars lined up behind us. This highway is generally clear enough to pass pretty easily. Just sitting here thinking about it though, I'm wondering if we're pissing everyone off or something.
