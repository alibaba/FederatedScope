Our room was on the 6th floor and it was absolutely fine. Two double beds, plenty of space, a safe, proper closet, tv, etc, etc. The room was clean and we had no problems whatsoever on that front. The staff were all very friendly.There is a restaurant joined to the hotel, which we didn't eat at so I can't tell you about that. We had breakfast at an Irish pub called Lefty O'Doul's just two doors down from the hotel which was convenient. You can also have evening meals and drinks there. We had a couple of drinks at the bar round the corner, where there is live music every evening.I would definitely recommend this to people looking for a good, clean and budget-friendly place to stay in the heart of San Francisco.\nquestion: How would you rate this hotel in the rank of decency?", "output": "Our room was on the 6th floor and it was absolutely fine The room was clean and we had no problems whatsoever on that front The staff were all very friendly I would definitely recommend this to people looking for a good , clean and budget - friendly place to stay in the heart of San Francisco", "category": "Question Answering 573.json"}, {"instruction": "You will be given a review about a book, an item, a place or a movie.

I grew up eating oyster and I immediately noticed how unhealthy the color and the taste of the oyster was. We asked him to bring us a plate of fresh cracked oyster after the complain and this time he actually brought us fresh oyster and it looked completely different from the oyster he gave us originally. Also the muscles were empty, literally. We found more than 15 shells and they were all empty.. where did my muscles go? The salmon is smoked and baked and tastes very dry.

This remote is being used to control : Hitachi 32HDL51 TV, DishNetwork DVR-625, Sony STR-DA7ES receiver, JVC HR-S9911U VHS, HP Z540 computer, Archos AV-500 PVR and an X10 light controller.  So far the only problem I've had is with the X10 controller, but I haven't put any time into debugging it.The computer I am using for programming the remote is a Dell E521 ( AMD 64X2 5600+ processor ) running Windows XP Pro SP2. Installing and running the software was quite straightforward ( I'm on a 3Mbps DSL connection ).  I find the software to be fairly intuitive, but did note the \"strange\" English that other reviewers have mentioned.The only glitch I ran into when doing the initial setup for the remote was that the software wanted to \"read\" some of the signals for the DVR-625 and the Sony receiver though I had checked before buying the remote to make sure they were supported.  It then occurred to me that both of these units have TWO remote controls ( both have two-room capability ).  The software was just checking to see which remote I was using.  BUT that showed me that the folks who have complained about the remote's learning capability have legitimate concerns.  I have had a number of teachable remotes, and this is the first one I've had a problem with.  The main problem seemed to be lighting - I had to turn off a lamp about 3 feet away before I had any success at all.  Then, if I had the remotes about 3\" apart, and pressed the button for no more than 1 second, the signals were received ok.  This is the main reason for a 4 star rating rather than 5 star.I spent most of today setting up the \"favorite channels\" on the remote.  The only reason it took so long was that I searched the web for appropriate icons to use, then had to edit them to get 75x44 pixel images ( don't try to use any other size - the icons \"stretch\" to fit 75x44 ).  A really good source for \"nice\" icons is [...]After getting the icons, setting up the favorite channels feature was a breeze.  And, best of all, it actually works.As far as the physical design of the remote, I find it very easy to use.  A lot of thought went into the placement of the buttons, and I have no trouble using it with \"one hand operation\".  The remote I replaced with this one was also a touch-screen ( rather old Sony one ), so I have no problem with the touch-screen.  I also have fairly small fingers, so that may help!  It is a fairly small screen.  I find the lighted buttons to be extremely useful, and it's pretty neat that they turn on as soon as you pick up the remote.  I can't comment too much on the battery life, since I've only had it for 3 days.  But the battery indicator hasn't moved very far from full during that time.In conclusion, I'm quite satisfied with this remote.  Before buying one, make sure it will control your components with a minimum of \"teaching\", because that's a real bummer.  You can check all your components on Logitech's home page.Added after initial review:  Just noticed the remote wasn't really turning the DishNetwork DVR on or off.  The \"help\" and \"device\" could turn it on/off, but not the \"activity\".  I wasn't able to correct the problem with any of the adjustments, but the setup allows one to add steps to activities.  I added a \"select\" to turn it on and \"power toggle\" to turn it off.  Now it works fine.\nquestion: Is the software included good?", "output": ".

Although I should've been a little suspicious when nobody ever said Let's go to El Furniture Warehouse because they have great service! I am just going to start with the postitives. First has got to be the pricing of everything under $5. I mean you can't really go wrong with that since this area is surrounded by students from Highschool and University. The pricing is great for people who don't have tons of money to spend on some places located in the Annex. So that is definitely a great reason to come to this place. In terms of the quality of food.. I mean you get what you pay for. I thought that everything was decently good tasting. I got the Braised Beef Spaghetti, Beet and Goat Cheese Salad and a Mac and Cheese with bacon bits. Overall my favorite dish was the salad, second, Spaghetti and lastly the Mac and cheese. Everything was cooked well.. Nothing burnt or under cooked. Now with my experience. This is what I was so disappointed in the most when I got there. Let me just explain what I experienced  yesterday (Oct 23.14): Around 1PM my boyfriend and I decided to eat at El Furniture Warehouse since many people had recommended me to go. It is close to campus with cheap prices! Since I didn't have to work and it was pretty much a day off it was a great time to go. I thought going for a late lunch would be great. As we walked up to the place I noticed two people looking at the menu.. I guess they were deciding on take out. I notice immediately that it wasn't as busy as I've seen this place at night. Which was great - since we should be seated right away, right? WRONG! My boyfriend and I stood there trying to figure out, since it was our first time there, if it was a self seating place or if we had to wait for someone to have us seated. Finally after about a few minutes staring around awkwardly at each other and the people behind us, who were also waiting to be seated a waitress comes from the back and looks like she is going to get us seated. At first she was going to seat us at a high table that sits two people and across the bar but then she quickly asked us if we preferred to on the upper platform area at a table enough to sit four and we agreed to sit some where more spacious. Now this is something that I always do at every restaurant since I get thirsty quickly I told the waitress as she was about to leave to seat the other people behind us to get us two glasses of water to start. She said yes and continued her way down and sitting the other customers. As my boyfriend and I are deciding to pick what to eat we are looking around about 10 minutes later (maybe longer) still wondering where our water is. Finally I told him to bug another waitress who was wiping down a table near us to grab us water.. She said okay and in about 2 minutes our waitress brought us the water. I mean I would be a lot more understanding if it was extremely busy and if she had to wait for our food to be prepared and cooked but it's just water from a tap.. I couldn't believe we didn't just got our waters right away. I mean we had a girl on our left sitting near us who was seated AFTER we were and got her cocktail almost instantly well before we got our water. I just thought that was ridiculous. Finally when she brought the water we wasted no time to order our food so that we didn't have to wait so long for it to come out like our water. We used the time it took for the water to come out as an indicator as to how long the food would take and boy were we right! We ordered like I mentioned previously: beet salad, Mac and cheese and spaghetti. I think it took about 15-20 minutes for the food to come out. My boyfriend and I were both on our phones and trying to kill the time until our food arrived. When it arrived I was very happy with my selection though. Everything looked great. Until my boyfriend noticed right away on his Mac and cheese that they had forgotten the bacon bits! (Which the waitress actually suggested) Honestly he was so fed up with waiting for everything to come out that he almost didn't want to return it. However I am not like that.. I thought if you're going to suggest something and get your customers wanting to add items to their food then you shouldn't forget it. So it took us almost a few awkward minutes trying to wave a waitress in this not so busy place down. When we told her that she forgot she went Oh yeah I am so sorry about that and quickly went to the back sprinkled some bacon and popped back without dish. This is something I just cannot understand.Why was it that it seemed so busy for the waitress when there wasn't that many customers in the place to begin with. Anyways after all of this waiting game my boyfriend and I ate all of our food quickly and just wanted to get out of there. We paid for our meals I think I came to $18? And we just put a $20 down and left. What a frustrating experience. :(-CL\nquestion: Is lunch cheap?", "output": "The pricing is great", "category": "Question Answering 573.json"}, {"instruction": "You will be given a review about a book, an item, a place or a movie.
