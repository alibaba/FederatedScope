Or you can mow the lawn, anything but suck out of the trough and whine!\n\n$12,500 per day?  Flying home for the weekend and not getting back for work on Monday?  In the real working world you would be Fired!  You in Juneau have become as big a joke as our National Congress.\n\nI suggest another voter initiative, one which would stop all per diem after a 90 day session!  Another option would be sequestering all legislators in a motel 6 until the job is done.  Bread and water only!
