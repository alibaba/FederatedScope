It turned out that she also liked me and their relationship was going downhill for some time.\n\nFinally, she broke up with him (after a 5-year relationship) and we started dating. He never knew about my existence and she didn't tell him that I was the reason for the breakup. As far as I knew, he still loved her and wanted to be with her, but she didn't feel anything toward him anymore.\n\nAfter dating for three months we started to have some disagreements. Basically, I became very involved and wanted her to be my full-time girlfriend, while she wanted to stay in a more loose, friends-with-benefits kind of relationship (but remain faithful to each other). I became frustrated, because I was the only one initiating contact and meetings and she never wrote me first. Shortly before Christmas we decided to have a break and stop seeing each other for some time.\n\nAt a New Year's Eve party (that she didn't attend), our mutual friend who has very good contact with her told me that she started seeing her ex.\n\nI was heartbroken (and drunk). I did a very stupid thing. I wrote to him that I was the reason for the breakup and that we dated and she wanted to come back to him because it didn't work out well with me.\n\nHe thanked me and immediately told her about it. Needless to say, she hates me now.\n\nIt turned out that they only met to talk. Our mutual friend portrayed it like she definitely wanted to get back to him, which turned out not to be true.\n\nI feel like I did a good thing for him telling him the truth. But I broke her trust and probably destroyed my relationship with her (and i still love her). I am also very angry at myself because I was drunk and misinformed and wouldn't do it in other circumstances.

He comes to visit this part of the country because he\u2019s never been here and stays at my place. (Until there nothing happened.. we were just friends.) \nA few days later he tells me that because everyone kept asking him if i was his girlfriend, he started to think about it. I said I\u2019ve never felt that way about him and if he thought this was too harsh and wanted to stop talking to me, it was fine. He says he doesn\u2019t want to lose the friendship so let\u2019s talk normally.\n\nHe lives with his family, which he doesn\u2019t get along with, says he wants to move to another place, so I get him a job here really near where I live.\n\nOf course I show him around, I introduce him to my RL friends. And on a saturday I just have a break-down on a club because of my BF, and by this point i\u2019m pretty fucked up and don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening, I just remember I\u2019m crying and my friends are taking me out of the club. A while after, someone tells me this friend, at the club just said \u201cI can\u2019t believe she is gonna suffer because of that guy. I don\u2019t feel good so I\u2019m leaving\u201d\nTake it into consideration that it\u2019s his first time in this place, he doesn\u2019t know the city... wtf........\n\nSo in between dealing with my ex BF, being ashamed of the break-down, and asking what was up with his reaction, I just choose to deal with one thing at a time, the most importante is dealing with the ex-BF. So I have been pretty much ignoring this friend for about 3 days.. but he doesn\u2019t stop messaging me like nothing happened..

Answer 'not answerable' if more information is required and 'answerable' if all the information is sufficient to answer who is wrong in this situation.", "input": "So a friend of mine was chilling over in my dorm room with a lady friend of his, (we\u2019ll call them Jack and Jill) both of them were enjoying playing smash bros with a bit of laughing and flirting, I would\u2019ve just let them be but a local dude from around the dorm (let\u2019s call him Frank) decided to tag along with them (to neither of their consent). \n\nWell while I didn\u2019t personally know Frank word is that he\u2019s that kind of guy that tries to force interactions with you even if you don\u2019t want to and has done it enough apparently to gain a fairly annoying reputation although the guys who I\u2019ve heard it from are too nice to tell him, due to apparently feeling bad about how he\u2019s a orphan kid and some other stuff, yet they do what they can to avoid him when possible. Well Jack has also had his run ins with Frank but his negative accounts are mostly when Jack has been hanging out with Jill and Frank shows up to ruin the party. Apparently Frank has a tendency to lie when around Jill and does so in a way that makes it seem like he\u2019s trying to impress her but at the same time his lies are so bogus that Jill can see right through them. Well Jack and Jill again are both too nice to tell him off but instead just let him go at it and entertain all his lies with occasional nods and \u201coh really\u201ds. \n\nSo here we are in the dorm and Franks starting to do exactly that type of stuff and it\u2019s getting on my nerves because while they\u2019re not dating or anything it doesn\u2019t take much to see that both Jack and Jill must be talking and Frank is really just making it awkward for them to enjoy each other\u2019s company. Well I had made the mistake of also letting Frank play the game as well so now he\u2019s stuck here and only making things more awkward. This whole time I\u2019m just observing the situation but then he just gets even worse, he was initially standing up playing the game but then decides he needs to sit down, cool, but for some reason he decides he needs to sit in between both Jack and Jill despite plenty of other space available so he initially asks Jill to scoot over but when she puzzling asks why and is hesitant to do so Frank takes things into his own hands and while Jill is still in the seat and playing the game moves her chair over from near Jack to make room for his own. \n\nWell that was a big problem for me personally and again made the atmosphere even more awkward, but I just decide to keep my mouth shut. So later on in an attempt to get Frank out of here Jack decides to switch to a two player game, and of course Frank has played this game so the whole time he\u2019s constantly instructing and touching Jills controller (even though, surprise, she wasn\u2019t asking for any of it). Well seeing as to how she\u2019s constantly denying his attempts to \u201chelp\u201d her Frank wanders off into the corner of the room and gets on his phone, and while I don\u2019t know what he was doing while he was on there he decides to randomly say \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m single... My dick is so perfect\u201d\n..... \n\nSaying this loud enough for everyone to hear, but I guess he doesn\u2019t think we heard him because as me, Jack and Jill are all looking at each other, our eyes giving that \u201cdid he really say that\u201d look, he decides to say it again, \u201cI mean my dick is godly perfect\u201d, this time passing by Jill and giving her a slight look as he does so, I\u2019m guessing for assurance to see if she was at all aroused by this comment, which she of course isn\u2019t returning. Well Jack is the first to speak up and tells Frank that \u201cthat was uncalled for and he should really watch out what he says and who he says it around\u201d but as I said before Jack is just too nice and I didn\u2019t feel like he really got across just how uncomfortable Frank just made everybody so I then decide to check him as well. \n\nSo, and I quote, tell him, \u201cNah dude that shits not okay, you say some stupid shit like that again and you\u2019re getting the fuck out of my room\u201d.  Well I\u2019m guessing it works because for the rest of the night the guy isn\u2019t nearly as annoying but still lingers in the room, and the whole time I\u2019m regretting not having sent him out then and there.\n\nAITA for the way I responded to the whole thing given what went down that night, and taking into account the fact that he\u2019s a orphan and pretty socially awkward.", "output": "answerable", "category": "Ethics Classification 1130.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, judge whether or not a specific person is wrong here.

It has just been too much for me. I'm happy to see them occasionally and do my duty so to speak, but it's just been too frequent for me. In no universe do I want to prevent her from seeing them, but I feel that I need to be opting out more often than not recently. She has gotten frustrated with me whenever I opt out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer family are genuinely great people, but it is exhausting being with them. We connect politely, but I don't really have much in common with her parents or her sister. When we're over there she is enjoying her time, chatting, doing whatever -- but I'm always left twiddling  my thumbs (and I try to make small talk, connect, etc.). I swear I have tried, but the experience is 9 times out 10 just immensely boring - and I feel that I need to be sort of \"on my best behavior\" - which is exhausting. What can be frustrating too is that she'll go off with her sister and literally ignore me when I try to continue a conversation with them -- or just hang out. I get that seeing her family is a part of the deal, but spending time with them is killing me and I don't get why I have to be there along with her so frequently. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCase in point: we went to her family's for Thanksgiving. We were there for the day, awesome, cool, normal Thanksgiving. Then, it's like 7 pm - about time to leave right? Great to see you, hugs, bye - then, she decides to sleep over. She poses this as a question to me - but it's not really a question, it's an answer yes or I'll get teary eyed, pouty, and become a mute for the rest of the day. So 7 pm to 11 pm is spent watching fucking America's Funniest Home videos with her family, who I've already spent \\~10-15 hours with that week -- and literally just kill me. The next morning we are then still there until like 1 pm - she's talking to her parents about different things, while I am twiddling my thumbs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, this sort of a came to a head today. She's going over her parents to make perogies for Christmas. I offered to come for 4-5 hours to help out. She was less than content with this idea. She told me she doesn't know when she wants to leave (read: we will be leaving at 10 pm and the entire Saturday will be spent with me attempting to make small talk and twiddling my thumbs). I offered to drive my own car and leave after the 4-5 hours. Same answer. I can't imagine that I was being unreasonable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole and does anyone have any advice moving forward?", "output": "answerable", "category": "Ethics Classification 1130.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, judge whether or not a specific person is wrong here.
