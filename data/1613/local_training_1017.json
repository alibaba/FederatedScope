The preferred titles are under fifteen words.", "input": "There's a lot to like about this case in terms of its aesthetics and overall design.  I should start by saying I haven't personally experienced this issues some customers have reported with the Kindle coming free of the case.  The Kindle and case secure to each other magnetically and, at least on the one I got, it's a secure fit.  I also haven't dropped my Kindle, so I can't speak to how well the case would protect the device in a fall, althogh it seems like it would probably be adequate in most cases.<br /><br />Some things I like about the case (in addition to the previously mentioned aesthetics) are the loop for a stylus, and the clever folding back that allows the Kindle to stand either horizontally for media viewing or vertically for reading.  I also like the way the Kindle keyboard fits into the case completing the set.  BUT...<br /><br />The devil's in the details, and some of the details end up being problematic.  The folding stand can't be used whiile the keyboard is in place, which isn't a huge deal, but might be a consideration for some customers.  A larger issue (which I also mentioned in my review of the keyboard itself) is the way in which the keyboard attaches to the case.  In order for the keyboard to magetically lock to the case, it is placed with the keys facing OUT, away from the case.  So, if you're using your Kindle as a reading device, or holding it on a plane, for example, and you have the keyboard attached, the case is folded open in such a way that your fingers are constantly pushing keys on the keyboard.  Naturally, this wakes the keyboard and can cause all sorts of problems.  Since the keyboard can't easily be used while it is in the case  anyway, it's too bad they didn't make it mount (or at least ABLE to mount in a position that would leave the keys inaccessible when it is mounted.<br /><br />That issue asiide, the case looks good, works well and has been a good companion to my Kindle.", "output": "Good Case that could have been almost perfect", "category": "Title Generation 462.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an Amazon customer review, write a title for the review.

You also get true digital quality and a noise-canceling technology to filter out unwanted background noise and deliver better voice recognition, better voice command, better voice recording, and more. Sleek, compact, and attractive, the itself is black, but on the pictures it looked like a very dark grey, and the base itself sliver. Nice...but I wished it would of been a all black color! Its also not built cheaply either, it is perfect for any desktop. This has got to be the best microphone I've ever owned. I'm thinging about getting my mom and younger brother one too! Note: You have be like a half foot away from the microphone, or you'll get distorted speech. For very cheap people this microphone isn't for you, because it cost almost 20 bucks!

The connection where the power cord connects to the USB piece developed a problem. I have to position this part of the cord manually so that it will keep working. Otherwise, the fan stops working. I believe, in a few days, the cord (and so the fan) will be completely useless. The manufacturer has to make better quality power cords (thicker; not just a tiny, slim cord). It is nice that the fan itself is slim (as the name implies), but the power cord shouldn't be that slim; it has to be thicker. I searched their website; I couldn't find power cords as accessories. With a replacement power cord, the fan would be fully functional again... until the same thing happens. Where do I find a replacement power cord (preferably better quality)?<br /><br />Also I attached sticky rubber pads to the bottom of my notebook, so it doesn't slide anymore when the tabs in the back of the fan are extended (see my first review below).<br /><br />Review for the one I purchased on 6-6-12:<br /><br />Pros: Very efficient and nice design. Large fan, silent, slim and light.<br />Cons: If you use it in a flat position, it is OK. However, if you use it in an inclined position (by flipping the tabs in the back), your notebook will slide, as it has no rubber pads (What is the purpose of adding tabs to the fan, if it has no rubber pads to prevent the notebook from sliding, I wonder).

I say \\\\\"failed\\\\\" in quotes because the drives work fine in other housings and therefore will not be replaced under manufacturer warranties.  - Flaky software that causes it to \\\\\"disappear\\\\\" from your network and often requires a reboot of your Drobo and/or computer  - Slow transfer speeds (covered by other reviewers)  - Suspect quality of components (my generic branded AC adapter failed after 14 months)  - Expensive DroboCare program  Bottom line is that it feels as though Drobo might not as reliable and robust as you expect a back-up storage solution to be.

I suspect the versions indicated the plant where the monitor was manufactured not the technology in the unit. My monitor has an excellent picture and no buzzing. The only area that I feel needs clarifying is that the monitor can only display WQHD (1440) graphics on Dual Link DVI graphics interfaces with the Dual Link DVI cable or the Displayport. The VGA and HMDI interfaces cannot  go past HD resolution. This resulted in my needing to get a suitable graphics card and cable. This can be harder than it seems as most DVI are single link.  I found an EVGA card with an Nvidia GeForce GT610 GPU with 1 GB of ram works fabulously with my standard HP Pavillion power supply and delivers excellent performance.

I recently purchased the Imac, a 32 GB IPOD Touch (to upgrade from a 4 year old Nano 2 GB), and an Airport Express Wireless router... I like all my new Apple purchases A LOT!!... the Imac is amazingly fast compared to what I was used to (the old Powerbook G4 1.25 Ghz)... the display is awesome and its huge size allows me to have multiple apps running and displayed without overlapping/hidden windows... I upgraded the RAM to 12 Gig (from Crucial Memory), and bought the magic trackpad (which I am only starting to get used to, and REALLY LIKE IT/haven't been using the magic mouse hardly at all)... I have only just recently finished migrating all my stuff from the Powerbook, and added some graphic/photoEditing/movieAuthoring applications that will show the power of the I5 CPU and 12 Gigs of RAM -- so can't really give a complete evaluation at this point in thyme... the setup was superEZ (typical for Apple products), and I could have used the Apple migration with a firewire to migrate my old account from the Powerbook --> but since the Powerbook was PowerPC based and the Imac is Intel based, didn't want to do that and possibly run into problems with program executable image incompatibilities... Migrating Iphoto and Itunes libraries was a little tricky but there are plenty of tips online on the Internet to assist when I got into a bind...

As a gamer, I demand a lot out of my hardware, and this CPU has never failed to meet those demands.  I upgraded from a dual core 3.4ghz Intel, and although this runs at 3.2, loosing the front side bus was totally worth it.  My former CPU transferred data between cores at 800mhz, so no matter how fast I clocked it, there was latency built into the chip.  By building the host memory controller for the cores into the CPU, Intel was able to speed up performance significantly.  I went from a barley playable flight simulator x to one that ran smooth.  Although there are few programs that utilize four cores, having them available insures that computing will remain smooth for a while to come.  The CPU will shut down inactive cores, and boost the remaining cores internally by a percentage.  It will also ramp down the CPU if the needs are fewer than that available.  Having the Extreme version of this chip, means the core multiplier is unlocked, and the speed is really only held back by the available power, and cooling in the computer.  I have overclocked my machine to 4ghz stable.  I would recommend purchasing a third party cooler, and getting good thermal paste when purchasing this CPU as it runs hot.  I use the Chilltec thermal-electric cooler.  It combines a heat pipe, and pellitier solution that is better than most water systems, without introducing water into the case.

I don't know if there was one bad production run, or conversely, one good production run, and I just got lucky, but after a year of daily use, my bag looks exactly as it did when I bought it.  I don't even have any scuffing along the sides like my previous bag.  All the stitching and zippers have held up nicely.<br /><br />I think that the positives have been well covered by now in other reviews, but I'll add that my 17\\\\\" Macbook Pro fits perfectly, with a little extra room all around.  My ER earbud case fits in the appointed headphone pouch, so that was a bonus, though I don't use the little pass-through port.  As mentioned, there is plenty of storage, and I have a ton of documents and my organizer in the largest pocket, plus a ton of cable, adapters, other accessories, and office supplies in the remaining pockets.  That's another point in favor of its durability, as it is packed solid -bulging in some areas- and I still haven't busted a zipper or seam.  I haven't had any problems with the TSA in using the ScanSmart feature, probably in 20-30 trips through a checkpoint.<br /><br />On to the negatives...<br /><br />1.  Padding on the bottom of the laptop pocket.  There is none.  Well, there is the thinnest strip of foam built into the bottom of the bag, but it might as well not be there.  As others have mentioned, I have heard the crunch when setting my bag down too hard on more than one occasion.  I should add some additional padding to the bottom myself, but there is no reason why I should have to.  The lack of padding should have been glaringly obvious in the design stage.<br /><br />2.  Lack of organization in the pockets.  I'm sure this is a personal preference issue, but my two smaller pockets look just like the ubiquitous 'junk drawer.'  Everything is just thrown in there with no organization, because there is none, save for the few office supply slots in the medium pocket.

The pins were shaped correctly, but I was still able to push them in, likely due to the cheapness of the plastic.  Luckily I stopped before I powered up the unit and inserted it the correct way.

There are many people who spend time looking through people's garbage to find personal information.  Once you've had your identity stolen, it's really hard to fix all that.<br /><br />There are two types of popular paper shredders, strip cut and confetti cut paper shredders. This shredder is a confetti cut, also known as cross-cut, and is the most popular type of paper shredder, because they offer a higher level of security. A standard letter size paper is cut into 300-400 small pieces. This makes it difficult to retrieve sensitive information.<br /><br />Most have sensors, so they start shredding when you put a piece of paper in and turn off when it's shredded. If you have kids or pets in the house, it's always best to unplug your shredder when you're not using it.<br /><br />This Aleratec DVD/CD shredder is one of the best I have tried. The shredder came well packaged. Placed in an attractive blue box, the shredder blade portion was well packaged and easy to remove from the package itself. The shredder box and the DVD/CD receptacle were separate and easy to remove. A very informative User Manual was enclosed, along with the Aleratec Registration form and envelope. A shredder lubricant sheet was enclosed, you feed this sheet directly into the shredder. Easy set up, plug the shredder into an outlet. Place the side switch to Auto position, a green LED light comes on and then start shredding. I had 4 advertising pieces of mail in an unopened envelope. Each piece was probably equivalent to four pieces of paper. Went in like a breeze. I don't find the noise at all loud. I do not have any CD's or DVD's to shred at this time.<br /><br />I found this an extremely easy shredder to put together, the users manual was helpful and concise, and most importantly the shredder works very well.  Excellent paper shredder, I will use it often.

I purchased the Kindle because i can save money buying books, and i can store my own pdf's. Ive been able to write several ebooks and being able to put them on my kindle to quickly go over is great. The kindle is so amazing that one could not say enough! Some say they would preffer an ipad, because you can move the screen with a finger to this i say, the whole point of the kindle is to be more like a book, and i preffer the page turning buttons, which are placed just where one would turn the page of a book....for the money its a great deal. I say its like a star trek device because in star trek, you never saw anyone reading paper books rather reading or working off of a thin tablet device. Think thats cool, cause i always thought that was a cool concept, save trees and money...but on star trek they only ever had one book on there tablet...but with the amazon kindle you can have many, many books.", "output": "The Kindle 3 ---like something from Star trek", "category": "Title Generation 462.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an Amazon customer review, write a title for the review.

This one has some features I really like, but it also currently needs a product running iOs7 to get the full benefit from the app.  In other words you need a iPhone 4S or higher, iPad 3rd generation or higher, iPad mini 1st Gen or higher or an iPod touch 5th gen or higher.  Android support is supposed to arrive this year but no ETA is announced-- which is an annoyance to me since I switched from my iPhone 4S to an Android phone a few weeks ago. So I'll be back to using my Livescribe Sky or Echo<br /><br /> until the Android app makes its appearance.<br /><br />The pen pairs with your iThing running the app via bluetooth.  The audio recording is done through the microphone on your iThing. This is a really big con for me right now, although when I had my iPhone I did find that the recorded audio was superior to the audio recorded on my Sky and Echo.  I like the style better.  It looks more like a real pen than the prior versions.  It's round all the way to the top with a pocket clip to make it more secure to store in a pocket.  The top of the pen (opposite the pen point) acts as a stylus.  The worse problem I had was getting the removeable stylus tip off in order to charge the pen with the microUSB cable charger cable.  The instruction booklet was pretty much no help and I ended up going to the support part of the company web site and searching for information.  The cap is on good and tight, which is a plus.  The pen point has a rubberized covering that I like better than the hard plastic one on my other two Smart pens.  At least I haven't lost it yet.<br /><br />The pen turns on with a twist of the ring in the middle of the pen which also extends the pen point.  Twist the other way and the pen point retracts and the pen turns off.  This is the feature I like the best.<br /><br />This kit comes with everything needed to get started including a rather nice black leather portfolio and a notebook with the special paper you need.  It's important to remember that these gadgets are great for specific purposes, but the accessories and supplies are not cheap.  I tend to buy Livescribe branded refills, paper and parts.  The paper I think can be printed with a sufficiently high grade printer, but I've never thought it worth my time.  Also, if you have notebooks that were designed to work with one of the earlier pens you will find that you can use them with the Livescribe 3 as well.<br /><br />One word of caution.  This is a recording device and depending on where you are when you are recording, there are laws about privacy or even wiretapping.  Check the laws of your state and remember that if a telephone is involved then you may fall under federal requirements.  It's best to get everyone's permission although federal law in the US only requires that one party consents.  If you are recording in certain states then all of the parties must consent.<br /><br />So I really like this version of the Smart Pen and I am looking forward to the Android app.black leather portfolio and a notebook with the special paper you need.

Have not had much issue with keeping connectivity with all our laptops, but smartphones and tablets had spotty Wi-Fi, at best.  Our devices would show great connections available, hook up to those connections, then promptly drop the Wi-Fi and say that none was available.  Only to have it show up again minutes later.  Keeps booting us off whatever we are working on.  I would suggest it's the phones or the tablets, since our laptops haven't experience many issues, but we can pick up Wi-Fi easily in other locations without dropping connections.  I have even tried contacting ASUS without getting any real help, other than to push this button or that one. Swapped out with another one, just to make sure it wasn't a defective router.  And, tried finding solutions on the Web (when I could keep a connection).  It has been too much of a headache to deal with.

Styrofoam peanuts exist for a reason, which is why they are supposed to be used. A competitor that rhymes with NewRegg rarely pulls that crap. {yes I know both companies have affiliates that sell through them and therefore are not necessarily shipped by them} Bottom line is this drive DOES run pretty hot.

I love new technology and if I have the cash I buy it. This laptop was bought though with the pure intent of complete and utter future-proofing myself as well as finally getting the most powerful mobile gpu out upon release for once. (I usually am behind on the technology.) I really am hoping for about a 5 year lifespan at minimum on it, I know I'll have to lower details over time, but for now I am enjoying full &#34;Ultra&#34; or &#34;High&#34; details (depends on max settings for a given game.)<br /><br />Games I currently play are: Minecraft (I run a server as well, not on my laptop but is hosted elsewhere), Saints Row 3 and 4, Sims 2 and 3, Farming Simulator Titanium Edition, Starbound, Terraria, Bioshock (all), Borderlands 1 and 2, Diablo 3+ expansion, Command and Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars+ expansion, Supreme Commander 1 and 2, Dungeon Defenders plus many others. This laptop plays all that maxed out and at 1080p no problems! Now I know I haven't listed many heavy hitter games, but i can say that this will play anything out now at 1080p on &#34;High&#34; and I may be conservative on that.<br /><br />Build Quality:<br />The Alienware has the winner on this for build quality, with it's reinforced alloy frame, but this laptop isn't very far behind on quality. This laptop is a cross between the Alienware and the Sager. The Sager had a better build quality than the Samsung I felt.<br />This doesn't mean this laptop is cheap feeling, far from it. It's got just about as good a feel as the Alienware did but not quite there. The keyboard does feel much better than the Sager, but the Samsung's keyboard was a winner in that spot. The screen on this laptop doesn't wobble as much as the Sager did or the Samsung did. It's a tie between the Alienware and this one. Also, this laptop probably has more of an Alienware look than the Sager or Samsung one did with the multi-color keyboard and extra lighting.<br /><br />Features: This is a hard one to compare, but personally this laptop wins out.<br />6x USB 3.0 ports, 2x Mini Display ports as many audio connections to support 7.1 surround should you want it. This laptop also has a blu-ray BURNER! which was more than what the Alienware had with it's default DVD-Burner. This laptop also has a direct button for switching between the dedicated GTX980M and Integrated GPU. This requires a reboot but the Alienware can do this as well with a Function key. But there is pretty much a shortcut button for this.<br /><br />Performance: This is unfair as each laptop was pretty much an upgrade over the previous one. So obviously this MSI laptop outbeats the past ones.<br /><br />Price: MSI wins, for $2300 you get a beast of a laptop. Alienware (as of this writing) doesn't have the 980M gpu and will probably charge far more for the same setup.<br /><br />Cooling: The cpu seems to sit at about the same temperatures as previous cpus, but the gpu maxes out at about 72C when being pushed to it max during benchmarks which obviously push it to it's max. (Chances are I won't max this gpu out for a little while.) This laptop has an excellent cooling system. It does get a little loud when the fan ramp up to max, but I took a like at the physical fans and they are the largest fans I've seen in a laptop. Max speed I hear a faint whine, but chances are your gonna be gaming and not notice it, and honestly if anyone else complains they should just shush up themselves. (I wouldn't suggest gaming in a library, while it may not be super loud that's just disrespectful, but ultimately any ambient noises will probably drown this laptop. Also I must note that the fan noise is only noticeable at max speed which you may not reach, I only reached it by hitting the &#34;Turbo Fan&#34; button. Even when benchmarking I didn't notice the fans much if any.<br /><br />Storage:<br />This comes with a single 128GB m.2 SSD and a 2.5&#34; 1TB 7,200RPM HDD. This laptop only supports ONE 2.5&#34; drive, unless you replace the optical drive with a Hard drive caddy. BUT! It has a total of 4 m.2 slots. with current m.2 SSD's you could put 4x 512GB SSD's in plus the 2.5&#34; HDD! SSD's are coming down in price pretty good, I remember when a 64GB might have cost $300+ now it's nothing. A 512GB SSD now cost about $280 now! a few years ago that would have been probably $1000 or more!<br />I do plan on adding in an SSD very soon. I also must state that MSI DOES include all the screws needed to add in more m.2 SSD's.<br /><br />Audio system: The Dynaudio system on this MSI blows me away! The Sager plain sucked, I will admit it, The Alienware sounded really good as well as the Samsung, but the MSI's blows them away in my opinion. Now I'm not a audiophile and far from it, but I enjoy listening to my music as much as the next person and also like to share music or videos with others and this sound system can fill a medium room pretty decently. There is plenty of range and it is far from sounding tiny!<br /><br />Overall, I am VERY pleased so far with this laptop and plan on upgrading it's 128GB SSD with a 512GB SSD. I will keep the original SSD as a Driver/ Dump drive until I can afford a second, third and fourth 512GB SSD. But otherwise it is one BEAST of a laptop without being HUGE! It is even outdoing my desktop somewhat and that has a GTX 770 SC gpu in it. (I read it could rival a 780 which may be overkill for my personal needs, but I got the money so why not?<br /><br />Incidentally I have to get rid of my desktop due to downsizing on my living arrangements which is why I was forced to another laptop, so I just decided to go all in this time around. Short of if I could upgrade on my own I figured I would just do that on my own for a tad cheaper.<br /><br />I will update this review if anything changes or after 6 months of ownership with plans on updating my review every 6 months until I can't edit/ update it anymore or get rid of the laptop.<br /><br />All in all if you got the cash, I suggest this laptop if you are looking for something to game on the go, i really don't think it will let you down!marks which obviously push it to it's max.

It was much more precise (you use your fingers instead of your arm/wrist), it doesn't accidentally jigger the cursor when you let go of it, it doesn't run out or real estate (even on your knee), it doesn't need a special mouse pad, etc. The only thing I missed was a scroll wheel (I don't like thumb-based trackballs).<br /><br />Last year I bought a MacBook Pro and it had a trackpad like all laptops nowadays. I usually give new trackpads a try for a couple of days before I get disappointed and run back screaming to my trusty trackball. I must have used close to two dozen trackpads over the years and all were lacking or unusable, but this one, wow, this one was something else!<br /><br />When I saw that you can get an external trackpad that is even larger than the built-in MBP trackpad, I was so there!<br /><br />The Magic Trackpad is basically like an iPad touch surface for your computer. It has all the trackball advantages I listed above, plus many things you can't do with either a trackball or a mouse. For instance:<br />- try rolling instead of swiping your finger for even more precision<br />- you can scroll freely in all directions, not just vertically and in notched steps like a scroll wheel<br />- it has gestures that are actually helpful!<br /><br />Using this trackpad has increased my productivity. Some of that is probably part of OS X. For instance, I haven't used scrollbars since I started using a Mac. I also like to use multiple desktops, so changing between them with a simple gesture is just awesome.<br /><br />If you are not happy with your mousing performance, or are ready to step up your game from a trackball, get the Magic Trackpad and be happier!", "output": "Better than trackballs", "category": "Title Generation 462.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an Amazon customer review, write a title for the review.

I really didn't want a generic Belkin. On the other hand, I didn't want something clever like a case that looks like an old book. So after reading the reviews and swallowing hard, I plunked down $45 for the case, half of what I paid for a mint HDX (the person did a poor job listing it).<br /><br />I was a little dubious as reviews seemed to be 50-50.<br /><br />I am quite happy with it. The magnets held the HDX right in place and it is great in both horizontal and vertical modes. If I were to have a complaint, and it is picayune, is it doesn't stand well on the glass dining room table. But putting a paper towel under it fixes the problem. The front cover panel itself sticks well, also with magnets. At first you think it is flimsy, but it is quite strong. The origami is clever and once you &#34;get it&#34; (read the insert that says &#34;read first&#34;), you are fine. I am pretty careful with my HDX, though I fling it onto my bed. No problems. I am sure one of these days I will drop it and I am sure it will be fine.<br /><br />You are in for $40 no matter what you do if you get an HDX. I think this product is either up your alley or not at all. No in between. Though I don't know if it is a production error or what, but the people who say the Kindle pops out baffle me.

I thought it would be unique to have a little turn knob to control the fan speed, but it prevents my BIOS and any of my third party programs from effecting the fan speed, which isnt a serious issue, but its very anoyying that my BIOS freak out evey boot up, and i have to okay the fact that it couldnt communicate with the fan.

I'm fairly fast &#34;touch typist&#34; on a keyboard, but slow on the smaller keyboards made for tablets. Using my 15-inch MacBook Pro at meetings works for me, but it takes up too much space on our table and seems generally in the way. So, I prefer using my iPad for note taking. The Livescribe Smartpen is the perfect answer. I was disappointed to discover that it doesn't work with my iPad 2, but it does work with my iPad Mini with Retina display and with my iPhone 5, and since I take those notes on a separate pad of special paper (included), tablet or phone size doesn't matter.<br /><br />The pen includes access to an app that requires a $45-per-year subscription. The first year is included, but the pro version is not required, though some may wish to have its additional features. However, it seems to me that Livescribe could have developed its own proprietary app that does not cost an additional annual fee. I haven't tried the pen with other note-taking apps, though I suspect it will work just fine. The accuracy of this smartpen is amazing. The only times I've had a problem is when my own handwriting gets sloppy--and for many of us this may happen frequently, since we rarely write anymore. I'm happy to get this practice with my handwriting, which used to be quite good.<br /><br />Those who occasionally wish to take notes directly on the screen of any tablet or smart phone (without a separate paper pad) might be interested in the Adonit Jot Script Fine-Point Stylus. It will work with a variety of note-taking apps.<br /><br />The bottom line: PRO: This tool is very useful to those of us who, like me, need to take notes that remain as a digital record for later reference across devices or to send to colleagues. I end up with both a digital and a hardcopy version of my notes. CON: As cool and useful as it is, the Livescribe 3 seems quite expensive to me.

I can't think of anything that could be added to this bag to make it any more functional or attractive.  I am in love! I am planning to order another one of these just in case they ever stop making them.  The price is more than a steal when compared to other bags of MUCH less quality!

I have this thing for cool things: Tron, sportcar Infinitis, and Nissan Z's. Well, this is the coolest mouse I have ever had/seen. In fact it matches my laptop, well, too; both are silver. Despite that, though, I would not deny the mouse if my laptop was black or another color. The silver is slick, and each of the colors are each really cool, appealing, vibrant, clear, and glowing. As in I don't tire in looking at them. The particular shades are pleasing. It's like whoever made it was me-- or had me in mind. Since it's perfectly cool just rotating colors, being able to control it to stay on a single color is a neat bonus feature. It is small and portable. It's also the perfect size for me--I have small hands. This mouse makes me happy. Every time I look at it I commend myself for my incredibly smart purchase, and for a good price, too. If it was for twice the price I would have been happy with my buy. I would say it couldn't have gotten better. It is the best mouse I could have chanced upon and it far exceeds any expectations I could have had.<br />Performance-wise, it is faultless. The clicks are quiet and the scrolling wheel simply works well, too. The laser actually impressively works on about any surface. It has a retractable cord which can be fixed at any length; this part might take a little practice. It doesn't make a difference, though, to how so very, very conveniently cool it is and all in all there is nothing whatever wrong with it. I'm glad I own it and I would be significantly, significantly disappointed if it was lost or damaged (what a despairing thought!).<br />Basically, I recommend this mouse. Its performance is to be relied upon, and its appearance exceeds all.

The color is very rich, and the dynamic contrast ratio make it very pleasing for playing games and watching movies.  It comes with 2 separate video input ports, VGA and DVI, and can be switched with the 1 and 2 buttons.  It also has the added benefit of built-in speakers.  While these speakers are not going to deliver theater quality sound when you play games or watch movies, for average use they are quite nice.<br /><br />with that said, the monitor is not without flaws. the speaker volume can be controlled with the up and down buttons, however, not sure if it is common problem, or I received a bad unit, only the down button works directly but not the up button.  what I meant is if I press the volume down button, a built-in menu would show up on the screen indicating the current volume level, and I can then adjust the volume with either the up or the down button; however, if I started out by pressing the up button, nothing would happen. So in order to increase the volume, I have to press down first, and then up.<br /><br />Another inconvenience is in order to mute the speakers on the volume, it takes a few button presses because it can only be done using the built-in menu.  So if I am enjoying music and then the phone rings, I would always fumble in order to turn off the music, and between the 1/2 and up/down buttons, it is hard to remember which button is exit, which is select, and which is to pick another menu entry.<br /><br />Another inconvience is that the monitor doesn't come with a headset jack. So if I want to listen to music but don't want to disturb others, I would have to plug my headset directly to the computer (and the headset cord is usually not that long).", "output": "great monitor with a few minor flaws", "category": "Title Generation 462.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an Amazon customer review, write a title for the review.
