Foot binding became popular as a means of displaying status ( women from wealthy families , who did not need their feet to work , could afford to have them bound ) and was correspondingly adopted as a symbol of beauty in Chinese culture .

Many of these processes are based in large part on similar coal - based processes , such as Fischer - Tropsch synthesis , methanol production , olefins ( ethylene and propylene ) , and similar chemical or fuel feedstocks . In most cases , the first step involves gasification , which step generally is the most expensive and involves the greatest technical risk . Biomass is more difficult to feed into a pressure vessel than coal or any liquid . Therefore , biomass gasification is frequently done at atmospheric pressure and causes combustion of biomass to produce a combustible gas consisting of carbon monoxide , hydrogen , and traces of methane . This gas mixture , called a producer gas , can provide fuel for various vital processes , such as internal combustion engines , as well as substitute for furnace oil in direct heat applications . Because any biomass material can undergo gasification , this process is far more attractive than ethanol or biomass production , where only particular biomass materials can be used to produce a fuel . In addition , biomass gasification is a desirable process due to the ease at which it can convert solid waste ( such as wastes available on a farm ) into producer gas , which is a very usable fuel .", "output": "Biomass", "category": "Title Generation 1397.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a text passage, come up with an appropriate title for it.
