English contains, depending on dialect, 24--27 separate consonant phonemes and 13--20 vowels.

Many sounds are spelled using different letters or multiple letters, and for those words whose pronunciation is predictable from the spelling, the sounds denoted by the letters depend on the surrounding letters. For example, the digraph th represents two different sounds (the voiced dental fricative and the voiceless dental fricative) (see Pronunciation of English th), and the voiceless alveolar sibilant can be represented by the letters s and c.\nQuestion: is there a predictable correspondence between word sound and word spelling", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 755.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given Wikipedia articles on a range of topics as passages and a question from the passage.

Battery chargers may be strictly manual, or may include controls for time and charging voltage. Battery chargers that apply high voltage (for example, more than 14.4 volts on a 12 volt nominal system) will result in emission of hydrogen gas from the battery, which may damage it or create an explosion risk. A battery may be recharged without removal from the vehicle, although in a typical roadside situation no convenient source of power may be nearby.\nQuestion: can a battery charger be used to jumpstart a car", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 755.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given Wikipedia articles on a range of topics as passages and a question from the passage.
