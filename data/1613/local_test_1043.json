Each partially filled circle represents a cancer diagnosis. Each slash indicates a death. Although white women get breast cancer more frequently, it\u2019s usually diagnosed later and is more severe in African American women. Breast cancer death rates among black women were about 40 percent higher than among white women between 1999 and 2013, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Ricks-Santi, director of the Hampton University Cancer Research Center, and another Hampton colleague, John McDonald, recently received a $446,000 grant from the National Institutes of Health to study the genetics behind breast cancer diagnoses in African American women. In particular, they\u2019re trying to refine genetic tests that don\u2019t seem to be as effective for black women as white. \u201cI wanted to make sure that there was equity in the way that genetics and genomics was being applied across populations,\u201d Ricks-Santi said. She has a longstanding interest in cancer research, dating back to when she was a kid. Her family has a history of cancer; her father has prostate cancer. That led her to pursue an undergraduate degree at Hampton University and a Ph.D. from Georgetown University. She worked as a post-doctoral fellow in a joint cancer studies program between Georgetown and Howard University. There, she saw a trend among genetic tests for breast cancer, particularly the most common ones, BRCA 1 and 2. They are sometimes an indicator for some of the hardest to treat forms, and they\u2019re also correlated with other kinds of cancer in men and women. At Georgetown\u2019s cancer center, which Ricks-Santi said served mostly white and affluent patients, BRCA tests often helped doctors decide if women were candidates for preventative treatment or if they needed additional testing. At Howard\u2019s cancer center, which served more black patients, BRCA tests often came back inconclusive. This, Ricks-Santi said, makes it hard for oncologists to come up with specific, informed approaches for patients of color. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that if you\u2019re not identifying the right risk factor, the right gene,\u201d said Melissa Gomes, a mental health nurse practitioner and a co-investigator on the study. \u201cYou can\u2019t make that personalized approach if it wasn\u2019t based on a population that included you.\u201d The study that Ricks-Santi and McDonald are leading uses family history and genetic data from 300 breast cancer patients at Howard, along with relatives without cancer diagnoses and other types of cancer. Ricks-Santi will conduct statistical research to find candidate genes that could provide a better test. McDonald, an assistant professor of physics, will then conduct the laboratory phase of the study, injecting those genes into cancer cells in Petri dishes to determine exactly what kind of effect those have. They\u2019re also working with Hampton University students on the project, who will be paid with grant money. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to create that pipeline of researchers that look like the population we want to study,\u201d Gomes said. This round of funding lasts for three years. But they\u2019re already looking toward the next phase. That\u2019s where Gomes\u2019 experience comes in, whose background is clinical psychiatry. She sees patients four days a week. In a second study, once they\u2019ve isolated some possible genes, they want to control for those genes and then investigate social circumstances that might contribute to breast and other kinds of cancer. Gomes hopes to use her background in psychiatry and patient care to help build connections in Hampton Roads in addition to helping with the social research. \u201cNurses are considered one of the most trusted health professionals,\u201d Gomes said. \u201cI think that the community trusts us and they value their opinion.\u201d Ricks-Santi is hopeful about this holistic approach, citing her father\u2019s own experience. Because of the small size of his tumor, they took a more wait-and-see approach to treatment. He moved to Puerto Rico for six months to relax. It seemed to work. His prostate-specific antigen levels, an indicator of that kind of cancer, dropped significantly and have stayed stable. \u201cIt\u2019s scary and exciting,\u201d Ricks-Santi said. \u201cThere\u2019s so many possibilities.\u201d ___ Information from: Daily Press, http://www.dailypress.com/", "output": "University studies cancer risk and testing for black women.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "\"The story does not discuss costs and should have. If colonscopy is not providing that value that people once thought, it should be examined from a cost basis as well. Since fecal occult blood stool slide testing is so much cheaper (something referenced in the story but without cost estimates given), this is an even more important issue. The story includes a lot of numbers and, for this reason, we\u2019ll give it the benefit of the doubt on this criterion although we would have liked to have seen more numbers in absolute terms. Saying that women had a 30 percent higher chance of having their cancers missed, for example, sounds like cause for a significant health policy overhaul. But what does that mean in hard numbers? How many women were included in this study, for one. And what was the ratio of missed cancers for them? We\u2019re told 1 in 13 overall, but what was the breakdown for men and for women? It also would have been helpful to see the absolute numbers by gastroenterologist versus primary care physician, as the skill set of the person operating the colonscopy also appears to be a factor. The story does not quantify potential harms from colonscopies, such as colon perforation. The story does a good job of evaluating the quality of the evidence. The writer includes sufficient detail about the study, including the ages of people screened, the total number, the years screened, and other important facts. The story does not engage in disease-mongering.

The somber gathering followed days of protests in Sarajevo and other towns over lawmakers\u2019 failure to agree new legislation on citizens\u2019 identity numbers. The row has left babies born since February unregistered, and therefore denied passports or medical cards. The protesters this time did not carry banners or posters, but encircled parliament with a ring of candles placed on the ground, and stood or walked in silence. The baby\u2019s parents said the time they had wasted persuading Serbian border police to let her in without a passport to go to a hospital in Belgrade for surgery had cost her her chance of life. The baby was diagnosed with tracheoesophageal fistula - a hole between her gullet and windpipe - and had already had an unsuccessful operation in Sarajevo. \u201cWe practically had to take the child across the border illegally, although she was legally allowed to travel for urgent health reasons,\u201d the baby\u2019s father Emir Hamidovic said. When the baby was finally admitted to hospital in Belgrade, Bosnian authorities refused to pay for the surgery. Though the Serbian doctors agreed to carry out the procedure, the baby contracted an infection and died. \u201cShe perhaps had a chance to stay alive, but this is an obvious example how the state does not take care of its citizens,\u201d said Hamidovic, 31, who is unemployed. The protests over ID numbers started two weeks ago after another 3-month-old baby was unable to leave for urgent surgery abroad because lawmakers could not agree how to redraw the districts that determine the 13-digit identification number assigned to each citizen. Similar ethnic wrangles have plagued Bosnia since the end of its 1992-95 war, which left it divided along ethnic lines with a weak central government and a system of ethnic quotas that has stifled development.

Commissioner Akin Abayomi said the man was clinically stable with no serious symptoms. Abayomi said officials were working to identify all of the man\u2019s contacts in Nigeria. The Italian had traveled on Turkish Airlines to Istanbul and then to Lagos, according to health authorities. Lagos state early this month advised people arriving from virus-affected areas to observe 14 days of self-quarantine. \u201cI have seen him this morning, he is in high spirits,\u201d said Dr. Bowale Abimbola, medical director of the hospital where the 44-year-old Italian was brought with body aches and fever. \u201cHe is doing well and we expect that he will continue to do well.\u201d Nigerian health authorities urged Lagos residents to take measures such as keeping their distance from people who cough and washing their hands regularly. Cases of the virus also were confirmed in Egypt and Algeria in north Africa in recent days. Until then, some global health experts had expressed surprise that no cases had been reported in Africa. Concerns about the virus spreading to countries with weaker health systems led the World Health Organization to declare the outbreak a global health emergency last month. WHO officials in Africa have warned that health systems could be overwhelmed. Nigeria is one of 13 African countries classified by the WHO as high priority in this outbreak because of direct links to China or a high number of visitors from there. That Nigeria\u2019s first case came from overseas and wasn\u2019t person-to-person transmission inside Africa \u201cshows that the Nigerian government had the right systems in place to detect and confirm this case,\u201d Trudie Lang, director of The Global Health Network at the Nuffield Department of Medicine and the University of Oxford, said in a statement. But detection of further cases in Africa will be challenging as more inexpensive testing kits are needed for on-the-spot diagnosis, Lang added. The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has hurried to train its 54 member countries in testing for the virus. Just two countries had the capability at the beginning of this month. Now more than two dozen have it, including Nigeria. Africa Centers for Disease Control has deployed an epidemiologist to Nigeria and shipped 1,000 additional testing kits, according to Africa CDC director Dr. John Nkengasong. \u201cNigeria is well capacitated to respond to the outbreak,\u201d he said. \u201cAfrica CDC had anticipated that COVID-19 outbreak would inevitably impact Africa and has been working actively with African Union Member States and partners on preparedness and response to the disease in the continent. \u201c Most African airlines with direct flights to China quickly suspended them, and countries activated surveillance and quarantine measures. Many had experience with trying to prevent the spread of the devastating West Africa Ebola outbreak that ended in 2016. Global health experts point to that as a sign of preparedness in this outbreak. The Africa CDC was created in response to the Ebola outbreak, and many countries established public health institutes. Nigeria was praised for quickly containing cases when the Ebola outbreak reached there in 2014 after an infected man from Liberia landed in Lagos. Nineteen people were infected and seven died, but officials were praised for effective public awareness campaigns. \u201cThe Ebola outbreak taught us a lot of lessons,\u201d the director of the Nigeria Center for Disease Control, Chikwe Ihekweazu, wrote in a commentary for The Conversation last month. As of December, all 36 of Nigeria\u2019s states had a rapid response team in case of a disease outbreak, he wrote, and 22 states had emergency operations centers. Nigeria is also currently dealing with an outbreak of Lassa fever \u2014 an indication of the health challenges that many African nations face. With the new virus case announced in Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous country with 190 million people and numerous air links around the continent and beyond, other nations warned of possible spread. \u201cGiven these recent developments globally and in Africa, it is not unlikely that we will have importation of COVID-19 to South Africa,\u201d that country\u2019s National Institute for Communicable Diseases said. Separately, South Africa said two citizens who had been working on the Princess Diamond cruise ship have the virus and will stay in Japan for treatment. South Africa said it was informed by Japanese authorities Tuesday after the quarantine on the ship ended. In a separate statement, South Africa said it planned to evacuate more than 130 citizens from China\u2019s Wuhan city where the outbreak began. It did not say when that would happen. South Africa is the first major country in sub-Saharan Africa to evacuate its citizens, while thousands of African students remain stranded. Several governments have said it\u2019s safer to stay in place and not risk spreading the virus back home. In Kenya, the High Court on Friday ruled that all 239 passengers who arrived Thursday on a China Southern Airlines flight should be found and quarantined at a military facility until declared virus-free. The case was brought by the Law Society of Kenya and others amid a public outcry. The court also suspended all flights from China for 10 days.

U.S. deaths from the virus topped 18,100 on Friday, according to a Reuters tally.

When we contacted him, he declined to comment. In the videos, which were secretly\u00a0recorded by senior Victor Quinonez, Salcido\u2019s comments were often met with students\u2019 laughter. He criticizes military recruitment on the high school\u2019s campus and derides the glorification of the military, saying statements made by United States President Donald Trump about the its greatness are overblown. In the quote that drew the most outrage, Salcido said: We got all our freaking night vision goggles, all that kind of stuff, and we can\u2019t freaking control these dudes wearing freaking robes and chanclas. Because we got a bunch of dumb shits over there. Think about the people who you know who are over there, your freaking stupid Uncle Louie or whoever, they\u2019re dumb shits.

Anyway, you better not freaking go. The comments drew a rather intense round of what has become a familiar pattern of viral Internet outrage and backlash. In response to the controversy, Salcido has been officially admonished by the Pico Rivera City Council and stripped of his committee assignments. He has been placed on leave by the\u00a0El Rancho Unified School District while the incident is under scrutiny. Even the United States Department of Defense has weighed in, calling Salcido\u2019s comments \u201cuninformed.\u201d Salcido told the Los Angeles Times he was receiving \u201cvulgar and violent threats\u201d directed against himself and his family. Pico Rivera is a tight-knit, primarily Latino suburb that has a strong tradition of honoring veterans and a large military-serving community, with two Veterans of Foreign Wars posts and two American Legion auxiliaries, said Mayor Gustavo Camacho. Speaking by phone, Camacho told us: I respect the First Amendment and freedom of speech and Mr. Salcido is entitled to his freedom of speech. But I want to remind him that the reason he has that freedom is because of the men and women who lost their lives in order for us to have that freedom of speech. Many folks can listen to an audio and interpret it as they see fit. If you have an opinion about recruitment or a particular college recruiter, why don\u2019t we tell our kids, \u201cThese are our options. I think this is a better option and let me help you get there,\u201d rather than saying they\u2019re dumb shits. I and my fellow council members strongly disagree with Mr. Salcido\u2019s statements and viewpoints. Frankly we denounce those statements. But Trinity College sociology professor and U.S. Army veteran Johnny Eric Williams said although Salcido\u2019s comments were delivered clumsily, the teacher shouldn\u2019t be formally punished for making them, calling the response troubling and overblown. Williams himself was the subject of a separate Internet outrage storm in June 2017, when a post on his personal Facebook page intended to criticize structural racism and white supremacy went viral after right-wing web sites interpreted it as racist toward white people. Williams, who is African-American, received death threats and told us that he continues to get them to this day. He added: The classroom is your social space where people can say things they wouldn\u2019t say normally out of the classroom setting so they can seriously interrogate it. It sounds like he was trying to provoke the kids to think about why a student would wear a Marines shirt without thinking about what the Marines do. Clearly it didn\u2019t come across well, but it\u2019s a classroom setting. He\u2019s not doing a major speech, he\u2019s trying to get kids to think about what the role of the military is. It\u2019s not simply to protect freedom, as they say generically. The question is, freedom to do what and whose freedoms? That\u2019s the question that should be asked. Why would a kid record a teacher like that in the first place without him knowing? I think that\u2019s a level of cowardice and of unwillingness to participate that is unfathomable to me. It was done with malice. All education is about integrating people into what it means to be an American. One of the most important things is to be someone who questions, who thinks critically and dissents. That\u2019s the most patriotic thing someone can do. Williams told us that as a veteran, he found Salcido\u2019s comments about the intelligence of service members to be unfounded and an excellent example of intellectual elitism: What happens is the U.S. military is the last option for folks in rural and poverty-stricken areas. There\u2019s no other opportunity for them. But the idea that these folks are not smart, I don\u2019t agree with that at all. That\u2019s how I got through college. I had to do it because I didn\u2019t have money. That\u2019s why you have a voluntary army, because these people have nothing else they can do. Then they go and die while the kids with money go to college and don\u2019t even think about the fact that we\u2019re in eternal war. Nevertheless, Williams cautioned that lacking the freedom to criticize the military is akin to fascism. He added: At this historical moment in time, people are more interested in how something is said, rather than what is said and what it means. Quinonez told local news station\u00a0KTLA he recorded Salcido because he wants to join the Marine Corps and was tired of the teacher\u2019s negative commentary on the military. Pico Rivera is a thriving community with a growing economy, but it\u2019s no stranger to cut-throat politics and controversy \u2014 and neither is Salcido. However, much of the controversy in the city\u2019s past has been contained to the local level. In 2010, he ignited debate when he took the helm in the city\u2019s rotating mayoral position, then removed a Bible from the Council chamber\u2019s dais and put a halt to invocation, saying it was unconstitutional. He was also placed on administrative leave by the school district that year after admonishing a student to be quiet by saying, \u201cShut up, Kelly, before I kill you.\u201d Salcido said at\u00a0the time the comment was purposefully over-the-top and intended in jest. The child\u2019s parent,\u00a0Gerald Kelly, said he was angry because Salcido was talking about marriage equality for LGBTQ people, criticizing organized religion, and (again) speaking critically of the military in class: This is the mayor and he\u2019s out here destroying these kids\u2019 minds. Why allow him to lead this city when he stands for non-religious beliefs and that it\u2019s OK to be against the Bible, [says it\u2019s OK to be] homosexual and defames people in the military? Salcido has clashed with his peers on the city council in the past as well, often as their vocal critic amid allegations of public corruption. Although Salcido has faced widespread criticism for his remarks, he has historically been a popular teacher with students. Some of his current and former students have come to his defense, averring that the teacher also promised to fully support a student if he decided to join the military in spite of Salcido\u2019s discouragement. (This purported gesture of reassurance was not shown in the videos.) More generally, students have described Salcido as \u201creal,\u201d \u201cinspiring\u201d and \u201cloved.\u201d One of Salcido\u2019s current students, a senior at El Rancho High School, spoke to us anonymously. (We have verified the student\u2019s identity.) That student described Salcido as a teacher who \u201ccares greatly about his students\u2019 success\u201d but deliberately provokes debate in his classes and encourages his students to have \u201cdeep conversations.\u201d The student also told us that Salcido \u201csometimes has a very sarcastic sense of humor, and sometimes it may be taken the wrong way,\u201d but offered the opinion that the teacher was expressing his \u201cgenuine beliefs\u201d in the video clips: Not a lot of teachers can keep their students captivated as much as he can. He really is one of a kind. He likes to get us thinking and he genuinely\u00a0cares about what the students think\u2026 He\u2019s one of those guys that you would be happy to see every day\u00a0and a person to always make you laugh. On 20 March 2018, the El Rancho Unified School District Board voted to terminate Salcido\u2019s employment as a teacher at El Rancho High School. As reported by the Whittier Daily News, Salcido has one month in which he can appeal the decision, during which time he will remain on unpaid leave.", "output": "\"California schoolteacher Gregory Salcido called members of the United States military \"\"the lowest of our low\"\" during a classroom discussion.\"", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "The company\u2019s shares rose about 3 percent to $1.97 in premarket trading on Thursday.

Rick Perry was debating rivals for the Republican presidential nomination on Oct. 11, his campaign was righting \"\"wrongs\"\" uttered by the other candidates through a Twitter account called \"\"PerryTruthTeam.\"\" During the debate, PerryTruthTeam sent out a familiar message: \"\"Romneycare was model for Obamacare.\"\" The Perry campaign has hit that idea hard. On Oct. 10, Perry posted an online video linking the health care plan that Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, signed in 2006 for his state (dubbed Romneycare by critics) and the one that President Barack Obama signed in 2010 for the country (dubbed Obamacare by critics). We checked whether the Perry campaign\u2019s five-word tweet was on the mark. Perry\u2019s tweet implies that the White House used the Massachusetts law to build its own national law. We\u2019ll begin our examination by noting that even if you\u2019re just looking at the two laws from the outside, without knowing any behind-the-scenes information, they seem pretty similar. Generally, both laws leave in place the major insurance systems: employer-provided insurance for some workers and their families, Medicare for seniors and Medicaid for the poor. Also, both laws require people to buy insurance or pay a penalty, a mechanism called the \"\"individual mandate.\"\" Both laws also seek to reduce the number of people without health insurance by expanding Medicaid and offering tax breaks to help moderate-income people buy insurance. Finally, companies that don't offer insurance have to pay fines, with exceptions for small business. Some other shared elements: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2022 Health insurance exchanges. Both the Massachusetts and national plans provide for voluntary \"\"exchanges\"\" that individuals and small businesses can use to purchase private-sector health insurance. These exchanges are designed to offer a range of plans with different benefits and premium levels. \u2022 Affordability subsidies. Under both plans, lower-income individuals and families can receive government subsidies to help them pay health insurance premiums. In the Massachusetts plan, the subsidies flow to adults living at 150 percent to 300 percent of the federal poverty level, depending on their household size. Under the national plan, the sliding-scale subsidies go up to 400 percent of the poverty level. Still, there remain differences between the federal law and the Massachusetts law. Two of the biggest:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2022 Cost containment. Critics of the Massachusetts plan have taken it to task for its lack of cost-containment provisions. The federal law makes changes to Medicare that are intended to lower program costs, such as restructuring how payments are made to private insurance plans offered through Medicare, known as Medicare Advantage plans. Since Medicare is a federal program, the Massachusetts plan does not address this issue. \u2022 Financing. Both the Massachusetts plan and federal law are financed in part by revenue generated from the individual and employer mandates. But the Massachusetts plan's financing is heavily dependent on leveraging federal matching funds, while the federal law, in addition to cost savings from Medicare, imposes taxes on drug makers, medical device manufacturers, health insurers and indoor tanning services. It also taxes high-cost health care plans. The Massachusetts plan does not do these things. So, the laws, while not identical, share many core elements. Next, we wondered if the federal law was indeed based on the Massachusetts law. Again, it\u2019s difficult to know what people in Congress and in the White House looked at as they drafted the final health care law. But according to independent reports, they consulted people who worked on the Massachusetts law. On its website, the Perry campaign pointed to an NBC News news story published online Oct. 11, 2011, under the headline \"\"White House used Mitt Romney health-care law as blueprint for federal law.\"\" The report refers to White House visitor logs showing that three health care advisers and experts \"\"who helped shape the health care reform law signed by Romney in 2006\"\" had a dozen meetings with senior White House officials in 2009, including one with the president. One of the experts, Jonathan Gruber, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told NBC News that \"\"the White House wanted to lean a lot on what we\u2019d done in Massachusetts.\"\" \"\"They really wanted to know how we can take that same approach we used in Massachusetts and turn that into a national model,\"\" Gruber said. Gruber received a $380,000 contract from the Obama administration in 2009 to help Congress draft the federal health care law based on the Massachusetts plan, according to the story. He earlier had been hired by the Romney administration to do computer modeling of the costs of various approaches to expanding health-care coverage, the story said. Gruber\u2019s biography on the MIT website says he \"\"was a key architect of Massachusetts\u2019 ambitious health reform effort and in 2006 became an inaugural member of the Health Connector Board, the main implementing body for that effort.\"\" Romney, asked at an Oct. 11 news conference about the NBC report that three of his \"\"aides\"\" had advised Obama on health care, disputed that characterization of the experts, saying they were \"\"consultants,\"\" not \"\"aides.\"\" \"\"I\u2019m sure the president got lots of ideas (on health care reform),\"\" Romney said, \"\"but the one person he should have talked to, that he never talked to, was me.\"\" Romney said he would have told Obama that \"\"the plan he was crafting wouldn\u2019t work\"\" because the nation couldn\u2019t afford more federal spending. And he said that if he were elected president, he would push for the repeal of the federal health care law. Romney\u2019s campaign has also played down Gruber\u2019s influence, telling Politico for an Oct. 11 news story that he was not an adviser to Romney and that Romney\u2019s administration hired him only to run econometric models. However, the Politico story also says that \"\"it is well known that Obama\u2019s health care plan was in part modeled after Romney\u2019s 2006 reforms.\"\" We also reviewed an article in the June 6, 2011, New Yorker magazine on the development of the Massachusetts and federal health care laws. Like the NBC News piece, the New Yorker article notes that people who worked on the Massachusetts law were also consulted by the White House. One was Jon Kingsdale, a former insurance executive whom Romney had hired to implement the Massachusetts law, according to the article. \"\"The policy in Massachusetts was real,\"\" Kingsdale told the New Yorker. \"\"We were very, very influential. I testified a lot. The congressional staffers would constantly ask, \u2018Well, how do you handle this? How do you handle that?\u2019 We were the go-to people.\"\" The article also describes a meeting in 2008, before Obama had decided to support an individual federal mandate, that was attended by people who would later become \"\"the key brokers\"\" of the final deal on the federal health care law in 2010. Among those organizing the meeting was John McDonough \u2014 a Massachusetts advocate for universal health care during Romney\u2019s governorship who had since been hired by U.S. Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass. During the development of the Massachusetts law, McDonough \"\"was named by Romney aides as a \u2018stakeholder\u2019 to represent consumer interests,\"\" according to the NBC News article. At the October 2008 meeting, McDonough laid out three health care policy options that the next president could adopt, one of which he called \"\"Massachusetts Avenue\"\" and was based on Romney\u2019s plan, the New Yorker article says. Fifteen of the 20 people at the meeting \u2014 representatives from hospital associations, the pharmaceutical and insurance industries, the labor movement and groups advocating universal health care \u2014 backed the \"\"Massachusetts\"\" option, the article says. The following year, Obama health care adviser Nancy-Ann DeParle sent a memo to the president recommending that he support a mandate like the one in Massachusetts, according to the New Yorker article. A few weeks later, Obama told congressional leaders he would back a requirement that every American buy health insurance. Finally, it\u2019s important to note that some of the key ideas in the federal law had been circulating before the Massachusetts law was written. For example, scholars credit Alain C. Enthoven \u2014 an emeritus professor at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business who worked in the Defense Department during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations \u2014 with popularizing the idea of health insurance exchanges as many as three decades ago. And at least one previous Republican proposal on health care has included an individual mandate, a plan put forward by Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., during the Clinton administration\u2019s unsuccessful push for universal coverage in the early 1990s. So, what of Perry\u2019s tweet? Although the federal law isn\u2019t an exact replica of the one in Massachusetts, the plan signed by Romney certainly served as a model.\"", "output": "Romneycare was model for Obamacare.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "The movement of the potentially deadly disease to a new province highlights the difficulties that health workers in Congo face in controlling the outbreak. Two new patients tested positive in the Mwenga area of South Kivu, adding to North Kivu and Ituri provinces where there are confirmed cases of the disease, according to the health ministry. The new cases are \u201ca 24-year-old woman and her 7-month-old child,\u201d said Dr. Jean-Jacques Muyembe, the director of Congo\u2019s National Institute for Biomedical Research, in a statement released on Friday. The mother and her child had visited Beni, in North Kivu province, which is the center of the outbreak. They returned to South Kivu province where they fell sick with Ebola. The mother died Thursday and her child is being treated by a response team, said Muyembe\u2019s statement. The local Ebola response team has identified more than 120 people who may have been infected with the Ebola virus by contact with the woman and her child. Those people will be vaccinated to reduce the risk that they will get Ebola. The Ebola outbreak in eastern Congo has killed 1,808 people out of 2,765 confirmed cases, according to the new report. The current outbreak, which started on Aug. 1 last year, is the second largest in history. The spread of confirmed cases to a third province shows that health workers have struggled to contain the outbreak, despite the use of a vaccine. Many people in eastern Congo do not trust doctors and other medics. An average of 81 new cases of Ebola are confirmed each week, according to the World Health Organization, which issued an update on the outbreak Friday. WHO said that its appeal for $287 million to fund the public health part of its campaign to control this outbreak has only received $15 million so far. Earlier this week, doctors announced positive news that two new drugs appear to be effective at saving lives of those who fall ill with Ebola. Muyembe and other scientists announced that preliminary results from a trial in Congo found two drugs \u2014 made by Regeneron and the U.S. National Institutes of Health \u2014 seem to be saving lives. Researchers said more study is needed to nail down how well those two compounds work. The drugs are antibodies that block Ebola. In the trial, significantly fewer people died among those given the Regeneron drug or the NIH\u2019s, about 30%, compared to those who received another treatment. There is less danger that Ebola will spread through Goma, the capital of North Kivu province with more than 2 million inhabitants, because about 200 contacts and suspected cases have been identified and have received proper medication, said Muyembe. He said people arriving in Goma are being monitored at the city\u2019s entry points. Health officials have also vaccinated tens of thousands of people in Congo and surrounding countries in an attempt to stop the outbreak, but the virus has now continued to spread for more than a year. Response efforts have been repeatedly hampered by attacks on health workers and continuing mistrust among the affected communities; many people in the region don\u2019t believe the virus is real and choose to stay at home when they fall ill, infecting those who care for them. ___ Maliro contributed to this report from Beni, Congo. ___ Follow Africa news at https://twitter.com/AP_Africa", "output": "Ebola outbreak spreads to 3rd province in eastern Congo.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "The school said in a news release that campus and local health officials are working to track down other people who might need testing.

Electronic cigarettes and other battery-powered vaping devices mostly heat a liquid containing nicotine into a vapor that\u2019s inhaled, In recent years, they have been increasingly used to vaporize THC, the chemical that gives pot its high. The University of Michigan survey asks students in grades 8, 10 and 12 across the country about smoking, drinking and drugs. About two-thirds of this year\u2019s 42,000 participants were asked about vaping marijuana. Vaping nicotine is still more popular: about 1 in 4 high schoolers said they had done it at least once in the previous year. But vaping marijuana grew more quickly: 1 in 5 high schoolers had done it at least once the year before. About 1 in 7 high school seniors this year were considered current users of marijuana vaping \u2014 they had vaped in the month before they took the survey. That\u2019s almost doubled from 1 in 13 the year before. Overall, marijuana use \u2014 in all its forms \u2014 is holding steady. It\u2019s not clear if students are switching to vaping or continuing to use other forms as well, said Richard Miech, who oversees the survey. Daily marijuana use rose in both middle school and high school kids in 2019, and \u201cif you want to be a daily marijuana user, vaping makes it easier,\u201d he said. It\u2019s odorless and slips easily into a pocket. \u201cYou can just kind of graze on that all day,\u201d he said. The survey is in the Journal of the American Medical Association, which also published results of a different survey in 2018 that showed an increase in marijuana vaping among middle and high school students. Both have limitations: the surveys rely on what kids say, and it does not include teens who are not in school. Federal and state laws ban minors from using marijuana recreationally, and prohibits sale of vaping products to kids The Michigan survey was conducted earlier this year, before reports of a surge in cases of vaping-related lung damage, mostly in teens and young adults who used black-market THC products. Volkow said the illnesses \u201cmay scare some teenagers away\u201d from vaping marijuana. The survey also found most other forms of teen drug use are flat or declining, including alcohol, ecstasy, heroin, cocaine, and meth. An exception was LSD, which has been increasing in 10th and 12th graders. About 3.6% of high school seniors said they\u2019d dropped acid in the previous year. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

Healey Jr. likes to wage. While the other candidates campaigned for months and spent millions in the most expensive governor\u2019s race in Rhode Island history, Healey didn\u2019t enter the contest until shortly after the September primary, when he replaced the Moderate Party\u2019s original candidate, who was unable to run because of illness. Healey, who has repeatedly run for lieutenant governor with the intention of abolishing the office, and who spent the 2002 election season handing out campaign condoms with the slogan \"\"Nothing never felt so good,\"\" got 21.4 percent of the vote after mail ballots were counted in the 2014 gubernatorial election. While the major party candidates, Democrat Gina Raimondo and Republican Allan Fung, saturated the airwaves with commercials, Healey made a few campaign appearances and put up a few signs. But his performance in televised debates in October won him support from a lot of people who like his unconventional style -- or didn\u2019t much like Fung or Raimondo, who won the race. The day after the election, Healey told Providence Journal columnist Edward Fitzpatrick that he spent just $36.29 on his campaign. He made a similar claim on WPRO, where morning host Gene Valicenti congratulated him on his strong showing. \"\"Thank you. For 35, for 38 bucks, not bad,\"\" Healey said. \"\"I probably should have spent twice as much. I would have doubled my numbers and maybe be the governor.\"\" Valicenti joked that he didn't count gas money. \"\"I know,\"\" Healey responded. \"\"(But) I had to go there anyway.\"\" The Moderate Party candidate -- who also founded the Cool Moose Party -- has cited similar numbers in other venues. That prompted a reader to question the accuracy of Healey's statements. \"\"Someone had to spend money for those garish signs over I-195. And those signs weren't cheap,\"\" the reader said. Indeed, there were more than a few Healey signs throughout the state. We decided to check. Healey's most recent filing with the Rhode Island Board of Elections, for the period ending Oct. 27, 2014, shows that he raised no money and spent nothing during the previous 20 days. His previous report shows that he gave himself $35.31 and spent it all on cell phone expenses. Healey told us the amount jumps to $36.29 when you add the price of the only two purchases he made since his last financial report -- a pair of postage stamps. Filings for the Moderate Party itself show that it spent no money on Healey's race either, at least through Oct. 27. So where did the money for the signs come from? Healey said a lot of supporters downloaded the public-domain images of him and his artwork from his website \"\"so anybody could produce anything.\"\" They printed their own. In addition, a local sign maker printed up his own signs and sold them at cost. The candidate also recycled signs from his past campaigns for lieutenant governor. \"\"We just crossed out the word 'lieutenant' and gave those away,\"\" said Healey. He also painted a campaign message on the wall of a building using old black paint. He initially had trouble opening the cans of Rust-Oleum paint because the covers had rusted shut. \"\"I found that rather ironic. They should make cans that don't rust,\"\" he said. In the end, \"\"I didn't spend any money on signs. Not at all,\"\" Healey asserted. In addition, \"\"people printed up a ton of T-shirts. I don't know what people did with them. But we're creating small business in Rhode Island. We're giving people jobs.\"\" \"\"We recycled everything -- anything I could cross out the word 'lieutenant.' We recycled buttons. We had some old bumper stickers from when I ran for governor in '98. In the attic, I found a case of Cool Moose combs, which I had in '86. Yardsticks,\"\" he said. And did he have any leftover condoms? \"\"We did, but they all expired in 2003.

Carson has highlighted the offer to the prestigious military academy \u2014 allegedly made by Gen. William Westmoreland in 1969 when Carson was a\u00a0ROTC student leader in Detroit \u2014 in his books and comments throughout the years. But Carson never applied to West Point nor does Westmoreland\u2019s schedule place him in Detroit at the time Carson said he was, according to Politico. What\u2019s more, there\u2019s no such thing as a \"\"full scholarship\"\" to West Point, as everyone accepted to the five federal service academies receives free tuition in exchange for their service. When asked about discrepancy on ABC\u2019s This Week by host George Stephanopoulos, Carson said the academy itself uses the terminology. \"\"Wait a minute George, go look on the West Point website, and you\u2019ll see those specific words, \u2018full scholarship to West Point,\u2019 \"\" Carson said\u00a0Nov. 8. \"\"So even though it is, you know, given as a grant for anybody who gets in, those words are used. And if a recruiter or somebody who\u2019s trying to get you to come there or trying to get you to do that, those are the very words they will use. It\u2019s on their website.\"\" We wondered if the words really are advertised on West Point\u2019s website. We could not reach the military academy. Searching for the \"\"specific words \u2018full scholarship to West Point\u2019\"\" turned up no results on West Point\u2019s own website or on Google. The official admissions page also makes no mention of a scholarship of any kind. Instead, it simply notes that \u00a0tuition, room and board, and expenses are fully paid for those who are selected to attend West Point. The academy\u2019s diversity page, however, states that \"\"this four-year college experience is a fully funded scholarship.\"\" Carson\u2019s spokesperson told us that\u00a0West Point has referred to their benefits as a full scholarship in publications, a point Carson made in a Nov. 8 Facebook\u00a0post. He uploaded two West Point recruitment ads targeted at African-Americans that contain the word \"\"scholarship,\"\" including one from the 1960s, when he was a student. We also found examples of the words \"\"full scholarship\"\" used in publications that are linked on West Point\u2019s website, as well as some old recruiting advertisements: \u2022 A dataset from 2014: \"\"At the United States Military Academy all students receive a full scholarship, including room & board and medical- and dental-care are provided by the U.S. Army.\"\" \u2022 A prospectus from 2012: \"\"As a cadet, you are a member of the U.S. Army and receive a full scholarship and an annual salary of more than $10,000 from which you pay for your uniforms, textbooks, a laptop computer, and incidents.\"\" \u2022 An ad in a 1991 issue of Black Enterprise magazine: \"\"Each year about 1,400 young men and women take advantage of the opportunity to attend West Point on a full government scholarship, which includes tuition, room and board and medical care. \u2022 An ad that appeared in a few issues of Ebony magazine in 1990: \"\"You receive a full scholarship, earn a degree from one of the country\u2019s finest colleges, and build a foundation for a challenging career of service to the nation.\"\" The financial benefits to attending military academies have been essentially described as scholarship-like or equivalent to a scholarship by USA Today, a West Point spokesperson in Forbes, and the Naval Academy. But the term \"\"full scholarship\"\" is an inaccurate description, experts told us. The phrase typically refers to a college providing financial aid to allow a candidate to attend a college free of charge, but that doesn\u2019t really apply to West Point\u2019s across-the-board zero-tuition policy, said Antonio Buehler, a West Point alumnus who founded the admissions coaching service Abrome. \"\"No such scholarship is named, every cadet is treated the same and there is an eight-year military commitment after graduation. Hence, not free,\"\" Buehler said. The proper terminology is \"\"appointment,\"\" said Vu Tran, a graduate of the United States Air Force Academy who runs the Denver-based admissions consulting firm Service Academy Coach. But because that\u2019s not apparent from the get-go, Tran says he can\u2019t fault Carson for using the term loosely, albeit incorrectly. \"\"I can definitely see where parents and students who are beginning the process can misconstrue it to be a scholarship,\"\" he said. \"\"But for those who have gone through the admission process and through the nomination process, they would never call it a scholarship.\"\" Carson\u2019s use of the words \"\"full scholarship\"\" is even more inaccurate if he\u2019s describing his own experience, experts agreed. Tran told us it\u2019s conceivable a\u00a0ROTC commander or even a general would encourage a student to apply to West Point, touting the free tuition, but noted that anyone familiar with the process understands that that\u2019s contingent upon nomination and acceptance. \"\"(Carson) would not have been \u2018offered\u2019 the opportunity to attend West Point at no cost, like all other cadets, until he applied and received an appointment, which he never did,\"\" Buehler said. Our ruling Carson defended his use of the word scholarship in discussing his recruitment to West Point, saying, \"\"Go look on the West Point website and you\u2019ll see those specific words, \u2018full scholarship to West Point.\u2019\"\" The military academy has used the words \"\"full scholarship\"\" a few times in admissions literature and advertisements and in one place on its website. However, experts say Carson\u2019s use of the word scholarship doesn\u2019t properly explain the application and appointment process to West Point. Carson\u2019s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. That meets our definition of .

The remaining 17 percent, including eight of the 10 largest school districts in America\u2019s second most-populous state, stress abstinence, which they are required to do under a 1995 Texas law. But they also teach students about other sexual topics, including birth control. The 17-percent figure is actually a marked increase from a 2009 study, which found that 96 percent of Texas school districts taught abstinence only. The number of districts that offer no sex education rose even more dramatically, from 2 percent in the study eight years ago to a quarter of them today. A major factor in districts dropping their sex education curriculums was a 2009 decision by the Republican-controlled Texas Legislature to scrap passing a health course as a high school graduation requirement. Of the districts that still teach sex education, 31 percent of the ones in urban areas offer instruction on more than just abstinence, while only about 5 percent of rural districts do. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in 2014 ranked Texas tied with New Mexico for fourth nationwide in birth rates for mothers ages 15 to 19. Some studies have found that comprehensive sex education that includes birth control information is more effective than abstinence-only programs at reducing teen pregnancy rates. But 25 other states in addition to Texas require stressing abstinence, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion rights research organization. Eighteen states and the District of Columbia require students to be taught about contraception. The authors of the new study sent surveys as open records requests to Texas\u2019 10 largest school districts and to a sample of 148 other districts seen as representative of the rest of the state. A breakdown by student population wasn\u2019t provided, though the eight largest districts that teach more than just abstinence educate a combined 17 percent of the state\u2019s roughly 5.3 million public students. The study found that many districts not offering abstinence only lessons rely on two major sex education programs designed specifically for Texas that incorporate classroom games, discussions and role-playing to help students feel more empowered. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has been less vocal preaching abstinence than his predecessor, Rick Perry, who boasted that he knew from his personal life that it worked. Still, the Texas House approved a state budget prohibiting schools from distributing sex education materials produced by abortion providers like Planned Parenthood, which in the past helped devise such materials for some districts, including Austin\u2019s. Meanwhile, Texas\u2019 state-approved health textbooks stress abstinence and haven\u2019t been updated since 2004. Some abstinence-only classroom materials characterize using contraception as \u201chigh risk\u201d sexual behavior, while at least one school cautioned students that sexual activity can lead to suicide. State Rep. Mary Gonzalez, a Democrat from Clint, proposed legislation that would guarantee sex education programs provide accurate medical information. It has little chance of passing in the Legislature, but Gonzalez said she\u2019ll appeal to her anti-abortion colleagues, arguing that better sex education could lead to fewer terminated pregnancies. \u201cIf you\u2019re truly for limiting abortions, then here\u2019s one way to do it,\u201d Gonzalez said.", "output": "Study: Most Texas school districts have scant sex education.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "Trinity Lewis had asked Judge Sandee Bryan Marion to issue an injunction in Tarrant County district court to ensure that Cook Children\u2019s Medical Center doesn\u2019t end her daughter Tinslee Lewis\u2019 life-sustaining treatment. Texas Right to Life, an anti-abortion group that is advocating for Tinslee, said the girl\u2019s mother will appeal the judge\u2019s decision. Doctors at the Fort Worth hospital had planned to remove Tinslee from life support Nov. 10 after invoking Texas\u2019 \u201c10-day rule,\u201d which can be employed when a family disagrees with doctors who say life-sustaining treatment should be stopped. The law stipulates that if the hospital\u2019s ethics committee agrees with doctors, treatment can be withdrawn after 10 days if a new provider can\u2019t be found to take the patient. In a statement issued by Texas Right to Life, which opposes the \u201c10-day rule,\u201d Lewis said she was \u201cheartbroken\u201d over the judge\u2019s decision. \u201cI feel frustrated because anyone in that courtroom would want more time just like I do if Tinslee were their baby,\u201d she said. The hospital said in a statement Thursday that in order to keep Tinslee alive, she\u2019s on a constant stream of painkillers, sedatives and paralytics. She currently has severe sepsis, which isn\u2019t uncommon when patients require deep sedation and chemical paralysis, it said. \u201cEven with the most extraordinary measures the medical team is taking, Tinslee continues to suffer,\u201d the hospital said. Efforts to find another facility to take her have been unsuccessful. The hospital said it has reached out to more than 20 facilities. Texas Right to Life and Protect TX Fragile Kids have also been trying to find a facility to take her. Prior to Thursday\u2019s ruling, both sides agreed that if Marion denied the injunction request, the hospital would wait at least seven days before taking Tinslee off life-support. In her decision, Marion said the seven-day period would give the girl\u2019s mother time to file a notice of appeal and a motion for emergency relief with a state court of appeals. Tinslee has been at Cook Children\u2019s since her premature birth. The hospital said she has a rare heart defect and suffers from chronic lung disease and severe chronic high blood pressure. She hasn\u2019t come off a ventilator since going into respiratory arrest in early July and requires full respiratory and cardiac support. Lewis testified at a hearing last month that despite her daughter\u2019s sedation, she has a sense of the girl\u2019s likes and dislikes, describing her as \u201csassy.\u201d She said Tinslee likes getting her nails done but doesn\u2019t like having her hair brushed. \u201cI want to be the one to make the decision for her,\u201d Lewis said about removing her daughter from life support. At the hearing last month, Dr. Jay Duncan, one of Tinslee\u2019s physicians, described the girl\u2019s complex conditions and Cook Children\u2019s efforts to treat her, which have included about seven surgeries. The cardiac intensive care doctor said that for the first five months of Tinslee\u2019s life doctors had hope she might one day at least be able to go home. But Duncan said there came a point when doctors determined they had run out of surgical and clinical options, and that treatment was no longer benefiting Tinslee. Duncan said last month that the girl would likely die within half a year, and noted the hospital has made \u201cextraordinary\u201d efforts to find another facility for her. \u201cShe is in pain. Changing a diaper causes pain. Suctioning her breathing tube causes pain. Being on the ventilator causes pain,\u201d he said. Duncan said there had been \u201cmany, many\u201d conversations with Tinslee\u2019s family about her dire condition. Tarrant County Juvenile Court Judge Alex Kim issued a temporary restraining order to stop the removal of life support on Nov. 10. But Kim was removed from the case after the hospital filed a motion questioning his impartiality and saying he had bypassed case-assignment rules to designate himself as the presiding judge. After his removal, Judge Marion, who is chief justice of Texas\u2019 Fourth Court of Appeals, was assigned to hear the request for an injunction in Tarrant County district court. The case has become a rallying point for Republicans in Texas, with the attorney general stating his opposition to the \u201c10-day rule\u201d and GOP state Rep. Tan Parker saying it \u201cdoesn\u2019t fit with Texas values.\u201d The 1999 law that shields from lawsuits doctors who follow the process of going through an ethics committee was crafted by a task force that included lawmakers, attorneys, doctors and anti-abortion groups. Supporters of the law passed when George W. Bush, a Republican, was governor include the Texas Alliance for Life, the Texas Catholic Conference of Bishops and the Texas Medical Association.

All but six of the 24 acres where he used to grow rice and vegetables have slipped into the water in recent years, he said. Another farmer, Than Tun, said he had lost 15 acres of his land to erosion. While official records were not available, other villagers backed their accounts. Farmers and politicians in Chaungzon township, just outside the southern town of Moulmein, worry that erosion in the area is being exacerbated by the ships that dredge its bed for sand each night. The sand is mainly bound for Singapore, the world\u2019s biggest importer, for use in reclamation and construction projects. Both the Myanmar government and the company whose ships do the dredging in Chaungzon deny the dredging is causing the erosion. But the dispute highlights the fractious issue of sand-mining in Southeast Asia as Singapore is forced to look farther afield to slake its thirst for the mineral following bans on the trade in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia over environmental concerns. Sand mining has been blamed by scientists for damaging sensitive ecosystems around the world, accelerating coastal and riverine erosion, and exacerbating the frequency and severity of floods and droughts, according to a 2019 report by the U.N Environment Programme. Malaysia, formerly the biggest source of sand for Singapore, in 2018 introduced an outright ban on the export of sea sand, used for land reclamation, and imposed tighter controls on river sand, used mostly in construction. Cambodia made a similar move in 2017, while Indonesia banned exports to Singapore in 2007, causing a \u201csand crisis\u201d that brought building activity almost to a halt. Singapore, an island state that has grown 25 percent since its independence in 1965 thanks largely to aggressive land reclamation, has since bolstered its stockpiles, according to sand traders. Officials in Myanmar and industry sources in Singapore say the bans have prompted Singapore to seek new supplies from countries like Myanmar. Almost 1 million tonnes of sand went from Myanmar to Singapore in 2018, earning over $6 million, according to the most recent UN data on the trade. That amount is expected to have increased substantially following the Malaysia bans, according to the Myanmar government. \u201cSince the Philippines, Cambodia, and Vietnam almost completely stopped exporting sand to Singapore, the sand from Myanmar has become much more in demand,\u201d said Aye Lwin, joint secretary-general of the Myanmar Port Authority, which grants licenses for sand-mining operations. The benefits of the mining \u2013 including tax revenues for the government \u2013 outweighed the costs, he said. \u201cI believe it only causes little environmental damage,\u201d Aye Lwin said. \u201cBut it generates funds for the government.\u201d  The Singapore-registered company dredging in Chaungzon, Starhigh Asia Pacific Pte Ltd., has extracted hundreds of thousands of tonnes of sand since 2013, according to the local member of Parliament, Kyi Kyi Mya. She said at least 150,000 tonnes were extracted in 2018-2019, but did not have the exact number for other years. Starhigh dredges the sand legally through a license with the local government that does not limit the amount of sand the company can extract. Most of the sand Starhigh extracts is sent to Singapore. The company last year bid to supply sand to JTC Corporation, a Singapore government agency for infrastructure development, according to a tender on a government procurement site. Starhigh also supplied sand for a JTC reclamation project in Singapore completed in 2018, according to Starhigh\u2019s managing director, Si Thu Phyo. He said the sand for that project came from Myanmar as well as Vietnam and the Philippines. JTC referred questions from Reuters to Singapore\u2019s Ministry of National Development, which said the country imports sand on a commercial basis and that suppliers are expected to abide by laws and regulations in source countries. The Myanmar government says the environmental impact of the dredging is minimal and necessary to clear waterways of built-up sediment. In 2014, the company paid compensation to local farmers who claimed that mining too close to the shore had led to landslides, according to Kyi Kyi Mya, the MP in Chaungzon. Starhigh did not comment on any compensation paid to farmers but said \u201cwhenever it is possible, we will help locals with small landfill work at our own cost.\u201d  Si Thu Phyo, the Starhigh managing director, told Reuters that erosion was present in the area before dredging work started. \u201cDredging is always an easy target when it comes to environmental complaints,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand and are worried.\u201d  Riverbank erosion along the Salween is not an entirely new phenomenon, with factors including climate change worsening the problem by contributing to higher levels of flooding and siltation, said Vanessa Lamb, a geography lecturer at the University of Melbourne who has studied the river. She said that a lack of baseline data about the river made it difficult to track just how much sand dredging was affecting riverbank erosion. But in a 2019 research paper, Lamb said\u00a0locals blamed accelerating erosion on the rise in sand-mining. It was not possible to verify those claims from local records or old photographs. Dr Aung Naing Oo, deputy speaker of the Mon state parliament and the author of a parliamentary report on sand extraction in the region, said there was little transparency around the industry. He said that there was no consistent monitoring process and that authorities were not checking how much sand was being extracted or whether companies were taking material only from agreed sites. For now, the government says it does not have plans to end the dredging or compensate farmers for lost land. Than Zaw Oo, the farmer in Chaungzon, said he is now in debt after borrowing more than $2,600 to pay for embankments in an attempt to keep erosion at bay. \u201cI am lost and I don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sadness is just beyond words.\u201d", "output": "As Myanmar farmers lose their land, sand mining for Singapore is blamed.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "The possibility that the coronavirus spreads in a mostly stealthy mode among a population of largely young, healthy people showing no symptoms could have major implications for U.S. policy-makers, who are considering how and when to reopen the economy. It also renews questions about the extent to which U.S. testing of just the people suspected of being infected is actually capturing the spread of the virus in the United States and around the world. The Navy\u2019s testing of the entire 4,800-member crew of the aircraft carrier - which is about 94% complete - was an extraordinary move in a headline-grabbing case that has already led to the firing of the carrier\u2019s captain and the resignation of the Navy\u2019s top civilian official. Roughly 60 percent of the over 600 sailors who tested positive so far have not shown symptoms of COVID-19, the potentially lethal respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, the Navy says. The service did not speculate about how many might later develop symptoms or remain asymptomatic. \u201cWith regard to COVID-19, we\u2019re learning that stealth in the form of asymptomatic transmission is this adversary\u2019s secret power,\u201d said Rear Admiral Bruce Gillingham, surgeon general of the Navy. The figure is higher than the 25% to 50% range offered on April 5 by Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of President Donald Trump\u2019s coronavirus task force. Defense Secretary Mark Esper, speaking in a television interview on Thursday, said the number of asymptomatic cases from the carrier was \u201cdisconcerting.\u201d   \u201cIt has revealed a new dynamic of this virus: that it can be carried by normal, healthy people who have no idea whatsoever that they are carrying it,\u201d Esper told NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d morning show. Such data present challenges to the Pentagon, which is deployed around the world, sometimes in confined environments like submarines, ships and aircraft. Testing the entire military is not yet feasible, given still-limited testing capacity, officials say, and detecting enough cases without tests is impossible if most cases are asymptomatic. The U.S. coronavirus death toll - the highest in the world - surged past 31,000 on Thursday after doubling in a week. It also claimed the life of a sailor from the Theodore Roosevelt this week. Five other members of the crew are hospitalized. Still, the case of the Theodore Roosevelt offers a case study for researchers about how the virus spreads asymptomatically in a confined environment among mostly younger adults. That cohort has been somewhat underrepresented in the epidemiological data so far, said William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. \u201cThe findings are of enormous interest because the proportion of people who are asymptomatic is just simply not known,\u201d Schaffner said, when asked about the Navy\u2019s data. Vice Admiral Phillip Sawyer, a deputy chief of naval operations at the center of the Navy\u2019s coronavirus response efforts, presented the 60% figure in a call with a small group of reporters on Wednesday. But he declined to speculate about the implications. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019re proving something different,\u201d Sawyer said. \u201cI do agree that we are providing some data that some other organizations might not have.\u201d", "output": "Coronavirus clue?

The study that is starting is being very closely watched in the medical field,\u201d Patrick Nataf, head of heart surgery at Paris Bichat hospital, told BFM TV.

The longest a patient has lived with SynCardia\u2019s heart is just under four years. In September, Carmat got the green light from French authorities to test the first human implants of the device on four patients in three hospitals. Earlier this year, it won approval to proceed with human implants in Belgium, Poland, Slovenia and Saudi Arabia. The Paris patient is the first worldwide to be implanted with the device, Carmat said. The patients selected for the trials suffer from terminal heart failure and the success of the device will be judged on whether they survive with the implant for at least a month. Conviti told Reuters last month Carmat hoped to finish human trials of the heart by the end of next year and to obtain approval to market them in the EU by early 2015. The Carmat device, developed by a team of engineers from Airbus parent company EADS, weighs about 900g (around 2 lb)- nearly three times more than an average healthy human heart. It is expected to cost 140,000 to 180,000 euros in Europe. It mimics heart muscle contractions and contains sensors that adapt the blood flow to the patient\u2019s moves. It is powered by external, wearable lithium-ion batteries. Inside the heart, surfaces that come into contact with human blood are made partly from bovine tissue instead of synthetic materials such as plastic that can cause blood clots. Patients that will be implanted with Carmat\u2019s devices are more likely to be men. Heart failure affects more men than women and the sheer size of the artificial heart means it can fit in 86 percent of men but only around 20 percent of women. But Carmat says it could easily manufacture a smaller version to fit the smaller bodies of women as well as patients in India and China.

To back up that claim, House Republican Leader John Boehner sent a \"\"GOP Leader Alert\"\" that said President Barack Obama was doing that to fulfill a campaign promise. \"\"During his quest for the presidency, now-President Obama declared that everyone deserves access to reproductive health care that includes abortion, and vowed that this 'right' would be at the heart of his health care reform plan if elected president,\"\" Boehner wrote in the Sept. 10, 2009, message. There's never been any question that Obama favors abortion rights. On Jan. 22, 2008, for instance, Obama released a statement on the 35th anniversary of the  Roe vs. Wade  decision that legalized abortion that said, \"\"Throughout my career, I've been a consistent and strong supporter of reproductive justice, and have consistently had a 100 percent prochoice rating with Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America.\"\" But he has been somewhat more coy, or perhaps strategically fuzzy, about exactly where he would draw the line on federal funding for abortion in his own health care plan. His comments on abortion rights have often used the phrase \"\"reproductive care\"\" rather than abortion. We'll take a separate look at the three parts of Boehner's sentence. Did candidate Obama say that everyone deserves access to reproductive health care? Did he say that such issues are at the heart of his health care reform plan? And did his definition of \"\"reproductive health\"\" care include abortion? On the first and second questions, we think then-candidate Obama did say something that closely matches what Boehner says he did. In a July 17, 2007, appearance before the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, Obama said the following: \"\"In my mind, reproductive care is essential care. It is basic care, so it is at the center and at the heart of the plan that I propose. Essentially what we're doing is, we\u2019re going to set up a public plan that all persons and all women can access if they don\u2019t have health insurance. It will be a plan that will provide all essential services, including reproductive services, as well as mental health services and disease management services, because part of our interest is to make sure that we\u2019re putting more money into preventive care.\"\" (This one is not included in our  Obameter  database of promises, but we'll examine next week whether it should be.) The words Obama used are slightly different from the ones cited by Boehner, but we think that to say reproductive care is \"\"essential\"\" means that \"\"everyone deserves\"\" to have it. Meanwhile, inferring from Obama's language that it's a \"\"right\"\" requires a slight leap, but it's close enough that we won't quibble. So the key to whether Boehner is right comes with the third question: Does Obama's definition of \"\"reproductive health care\"\" necessarily include abortion? On this question, the evidence is suggestive but not quite a slam dunk. Abortion opponents rely on a few pieces of evidence to support the assertion that Obama believes reproductive health care includes abortion. One is a story that ran in the  Chicago Tribune  on July 18, 2007, the day after Obama's Planned Parenthood speech. In it, Washington bureau reporter Mike Dorning wrote that when Obama was asked about his proposal for expanded access to health insurance, the candidate \"\"said it would cover 'reproductive health services.' Contacted afterward, an Obama spokesman said that included abortions.\"\" Another source is a candidate questionnaire by RH Reality Check, which describes itself as \"\"an online community and publication serving individuals and organizations committed to advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights.\"\" Posted Dec. 21, 2007, the questionnaire was filled out by \"\"Sen. Barack Obama's campaign staff.\"\" The question that's most relevant to Boehner's assertion is this one:   Q: Does Sen. Obama support the Hyde amendment (which bars the use of federal funds to pay for abortions)? Under what circumstances does he believe that Medicaid should cover abortions (all pregnancies, life- or health-threatening pregnancies, pregnancies that are a result of rape or incest, extreme fetal malformation)? A: Obama does not support the Hyde amendment. He believes that the federal government should not use its dollars to intrude on a poor woman's decision whether to carry to term or to terminate her pregnancy and selectively withhold benefits because she seeks to exercise her right of reproductive choice in a manner the government disfavors. Both of these comments suggest, fairly strongly, that Obama would include access to abortion in his health care plan \u2014 but they leave a degree of doubt. While we are not aware of any pushback from the campaign once these two items were published, both statements were made by campaign staffers, not the candidate himself. On his campaign Web site, Obama did not specifically address the federal funding issue. In the \"\"women's issues\"\" section, the campaign said only that \"\"Barack Obama understands that abortion is a divisive issue, and respects those who disagree with him. However, he has been a consistent champion of reproductive choice and will make preserving women's rights under  Roe vs. Wade  a priority as president. He opposes any constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court's decision in that case.\"\" Asked for any additional evidence to back up Boehner's assertion that Obama was referring specifically to abortion, Douglas Johnson, legislative director for the National Right to Life Committee, told PolitiFact that Obama was speaking in \"\"terms of art\"\" that his Planned Parenthood audience would immediately grasp. \"\"'Reproductive health services' is one of those conventions that all of the players understand. It is not limited to abortion, but it always encompasses abortion. It is like when a prolife candidate says, 'I support strong legal protection for the right to life of unborn children.' Everyone on all sides understands that this means he thinks abortion generally should not be legal, and no doubt he also supports fetal homicide laws . . . I suppose someone could argue that since he didn't specifically mention abortion, there is the theoretical possibility that he wants to keep abortion completely unrestricted and only wants to pass fetal homicide laws. But that would be to ignore the lexicon that groups develop on these issues and the way they are understood in context.\"\" So back to Boehner's claim. He said that candidate Obama \"\"declared that everyone deserves access to reproductive health care that includes abortion, and vowed that this 'right' would be at the heart of his health care reform plan if elected president.\"\" The record shows that Obama did indeed make those statements. His message to the abortion rights group may have been deliberately fuzzy, but it's clear what he meant \u2014 and it was confirmed by the campaign to the  Tribune  reporter.

He has been pummeled by opponents in his re-election bid who say his administration\u2019s response has mishandled the crisis. Jeffries, who did not cite a potential cost, said several of the buildings on the 130-year-old campus in western Illinois would be razed to make way for \u201cstate-of-the-art facilities\u201d during the next three to five years. At another point Jeffries indicated that preliminary recommendations from task forces Rauner appointed would be delivered by March 31 with a final version due May 1. Rauner faces voters in a GOP primary election March 20. Rauner spokeswoman Rachel Bold said late Monday that plumbing replacement hasn\u2019t been ruled out and noted that Rauner\u2019s pronouncement in January included suggesting constructing a \u201cbrand-new building here that has the latest technology.\u201d The administration installed a $6.5 million water-treatment plant, adopted rigorous plumbing-fixture flushing protocols, installed filters on fixtures, and treated water with heat and chemicals, among other steps, in its effort to stop the problem. After initially appearing in 2015, Legionnaire\u2019s disease returned to the facility in 2016 and 2017. Four more cases were confirmed last month. Monday\u2019s hearing was called after the administration released an August 2016 report from Belleville-based consulting engineer BRiC Partnership suggesting steps to mitigate the problem, including replacing the underground water-distribution system and plumbing inside 15 campus buildings where the most susceptible residents live for $8 million. Jeffries said in December that plumbing replacement could cost $500 million or more; in January, she told lawmakers the price tag was $25 million to $30 million, but didn\u2019t specify the source of that estimate. She has never explained why she used estimates that at a minimum were more than four times higher than the actual number. BRiC\u2019s 2016 report, which cost $20,000, listed about a dozen ideas for a total of $17 million. The administration paid BRiC another $40,000 to update and expand its 2016 report. That update released last month indicated plumbing replacement for the entire campus would be $11 million; expanded options for the other ideas combined would cost no more than $24 million. Jeffries explained Monday that the August 2016 delivery of the BRiC report was just two months after the June completion of a $6.5 million water-treatment facility and wanted to test its effectiveness before taking any more actions. But Public Health officials had confirmed two more cases of Legionnaires\u2019 in late July, just days before BRiC\u2019s arrival on campus. ___ Contact Political Writer John O\u2019Connor at https://twitter.com/apoconnor .

This is way too early to consider costs which, we assume, would be substantial. The story says the stem cell intervention extended the rodents\u2019 lives \u201cby 10-15% compared to untreated animals.\u201d\u00a0 At another point, it said, \u201cthe mice lived longer than controls, typically several months more, an increase of about 15%.\u201d The story makes no mention of the potential harms that might arise from this approach. Since this has never been tested in humans, we have no idea what they risks are. The story needed to point this out. Theoretically, the stem cells would have to be delivered into human brains via injections, which would make the intervention incredibly risky and possibly a non-starter. In the original paper, the stem cells were injected into the hypothalamus of the mice using viruses as \u201cvectors.\u201d The researchers used lentiviruses, which are used often as vectors for research, but can be deadly in humans. Some discussion of this hurdle also was warranted. The story does a good job at explaining various aspects of the research and depicting the stages through which the research team drew its conclusions. It also is up front about this being animal research, so far untried in humans at even the earliest stages of clinical trials. Of note, the original paper mentions that this study was conducted in very few mice (total of about 20) and only in male mice. That detail would have been useful to include. One thing we wanted to point out that was problematic: The story said \u201cif a similar extension was achieved in humans, a person with a life expectancy of 80 years could live to 92.\u201d We have no idea how this may impact humans; the evidence doesn\u2019t support that kind of speculation. The story doesn\u2019t appear to commit disease mongering, though it could have pointed out that aging in and of itself is not a disease. The story does quote one source unaffiliated with the research and we didn\u2019t detect any conflicts of interest. (The paper itself notes that the authors of the study have no conflicts of interests.) The story is all about basic research that suggests an approach that one day might slow, or possibly reverse, the aging process. There are no real alternatives available now to affect the aging process beyond lifestyle choices that might be healthier and appropriate treatments for illnesses that might otherwise shorten lifespans.

The story clearly says, \u201cThe next step is to create human neural stem cells in the lab for testing.\u201d\u00a0 It also states that, \u201cResearchers at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York hope to launch clinical trials of the procedure soon, but must first produce supplies of human neural stem cells in the lab which can be implanted into volunteers.\u201d The story heralds this research as a \u201ctour de force\u201d and a \u201cbreakthrough.\u201d Yet is it accurate in a news story to call anything done in animals a \u201cbreakthrough?\u201d That word implies relevance to humans, and this is far from established in a mouse study.

One uncommon (but not unprecedented) circumstance presaging a Supreme Court battle occurred when Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia unexpectedly passed away on 13 February 2016, leaving President Barack Obama to nominate a replacement. (Although Supreme Court justices are appointed for life, over the last several decades most court vacancies have been created through the retirement or resignation of sitting justices rather than death, thereby providing Presidents with ample time to consider and nominate their replacements.) Since at the time of Antonin Scalia\u2019s death, President Obama had less than a year remaining in his final office while the Republicans held a majority of seats in the U.S. Senate, the GOP served notice that they could simply delay confirmation of whomever President Obama nominated replace to Scalia until after the upcoming presidential election in the hopes that they might regain the White House and then put forth their own nominee instead. This chain of events, naturally, prompted criticisms about one side\u2019s \u201cplaying games\u201d with the Supreme Court confirmation process and the other side\u2019s engaging in hypocrisy for objecting to something they themselves had advocated on previous occasions. This rhetorical battle was reflected in various images circulated by social media that portrayed members of both parties as opportunistic flip-floppers who justified whichever approach suited their side at the time. One such image featured quotes from Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader (and a Republican), advocating (in 2016) that Scalia\u2019s seat remain open until after the next presidential election, while stating (in 2001) that the President \u201cis entitled to tilt the judiciary in the direction that he feels appropriate\u201d: 2016: The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president. 2001: My view now is that the President won the election, no matter what the margin, and is entitled to tilt the judiciary in the direction that he feels appropriate. Verifying the accuracy and meaning of the first quote is fairly straightforward: On 13 February 2016 (the day Scalia died),\u00a0McConnell\u2019s words were widely reported   Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate should not confirm a replacement for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia until after the 2016 election \u2014 an historic rebuke of President Obama\u2019s authority and an extraordinary challenge to the practice of considering each nominee on his or her individual merits. The swiftness of McConnell\u2019s statement \u2014 coming about an hour after Scalia\u2019s death in Texas had been confirmed \u2014 stunned White House officials who had expected the Kentucky Republican to block their nominee with every tool at his disposal, but didn\u2019t imagine the combative GOP leader would issue an instant, categorical rejection of anyone Obama chose to nominate. \u201cThe American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,\u201d McConnell said, at a time when other elected officials, from Sen. Bernie Sanders to future Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer, were releasing statements offering condolences to the justice\u2019s family, which includes 26 grandchildren. The second quote stemmed from hearings held in 2001 by a Congressional Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts regarding the judicial nomination and confirmation process (for all federal judicial appointments, not just Supreme Court justices), hearings that \u201cfocused on the vital question of what role ideology should play in the selection and confirmation of judges.\u201d   Senator McConnell, as a member of the Committee on the Judiciary, averred (in part) that the role of the Senate should largely be to examine \u201cthe competence and the integrity and the fitness of a judge to be on the bench\u201d rather than a nominee\u2019s political ideology, that the Senate should \u201cdefer to the President on the question of ideology,\u201d that the President is \u201centitled for the most part to tilt the judiciary in the direction that he feels appropriate,\u201d and that he (i.e., McConnell) had accordingly approved every one of judicial nominees put forth by President Bill Clinton (a Democrat):  I first began to deal with the Senate\u2019s advise and consent role as a staffer here in 1969 and 1970 to a member of this Committee during the  Haynesworth and Carswell nominations, and subsequently wrote the only law journal article I wrote as a young man on that subject after those contentious nominations were concluded. I believed then and believe now that the appropriate role of the Senate is largely as Senator Kyl suggested, which is to judge the competence and the integrity and the fitness of a judge to be on the bench. I dutifully returned, gagging occasionally, every single one of the blue slips I received during the Clinton years positively. My view then and my view now is that the President won the election, no matter what the margin, and is entitled for the most part to tilt the judiciary in the direction that he feels appropriate. What I fear is going on with the hearing today is trying to establish a new litmus test for the Senate that has not existed in the past. I don\u2019t understand why we are seeking to do that. As Senator Sessions pointed out, and I think Senator Kyl alluded to this as well, 377 of President Clinton\u2019s nominees were approved. During 75 percent of his term, there was a Republican Senate here. During President Reagan\u2019s years, during which he had during 75 percent of his tenure in office a sympathetic Senate, only a few more were confirmed, 382. That is why the safest place to be and the sound place to be and the place where the Senate has been most of the history of our country is largely deferring to the President on the question of ideology and judging the competence and the integrity of the nominee. I doubt if the Founding Fathers were aware that there would be a Judiciary Committee. It probably never occurred to them. When they said \u201cadvise and consent,\u201d I think they were talking about the full Senate. Certainly, the Founding Fathers did not envision that there would be a bunch of co-presidents here. They did, after all, give the power to nominate to the\u00a0President. McConnell concurred with\u00a0a previous statement offered by\u00a0Jon Kyl, a Republican senator from Arizona, who said (in part): I find it interesting that the argument that a candidate\u2019s ideology should be a sufficient rationale for rejection is characterized as a bipartisan approach. I would think that bipartisanship would mean quite the opposite. Cooperation with the President on a bipartisan basis I don\u2019t think begins with a threat that we are going to reject your nominees, no matter how competent they might be, if we don\u2019t like their political ideology, as we interpret it to be. I think we should make no mistake that what is being suggested here is a significant departure from the way that nominees have traditionally been treated. Have there been exceptions? Quite assuredly so, but they prove the rule because they are exceptions to that general deference that has always been given to the President\u2019s nominees. From a bipartisan point of view, it concerns me because I do believe it puts us on a very dangerous path of confrontation and contention here within the Congress, as well as in our relationship with the President, and also, as Senator Sessions has said, creates a very bad precedent. I also found it interesting that the Chairman alluded to President Bush\u2019s campaign theme and frankly the reaction to that by his opponent, who made it clear that if President Bush were elected, he would be putting strict constructionists like Justice Thomas and Justice Scalia on the Supreme Court. That, of course, I think was a correct characterization of the tradition that a President does do that. A President has that right when he is elected, and he has been elected, by the way, even though it was a close election. President Bush is the President, and I think the Democrats who campaigned against him on the basis that he would try to appoint people that were consistent with his judicial philosophy were correct in saying that he would do that, that that would be the end result, because the Senate has always confirmed nominees more or less of the President elected, regardless of how close the election was. President Clinton, after all, never had a majority of the citizens of this country vote for him, but we gave significant deference to his nominees. My point is that for us as political figures \u2014 and this is our milieu, politics \u2014 to try to translate our political views onto a Court\u2019s job and maintain balance by our confirmations, I think, is sheer folly. Instead, we should all revert to what has traditionally been our role, judging the competence of the candidate; the qualifications, including judicial temperament, the background; and also some look at judicial philosophy. Another image featured similar \u201cflip-flopping\u201d statements from Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, a Democrat who previously served as Senate Majority Leader: The duties of the Senate are set forth in the U.S. Constitution. Nowhere in that document\u00a0does it say the Senate has a duty to give presidential appointees a vote. [19 May 2005]  We have that nasty little Constitution, which says\u00a0they are obligated to hold hearings and they are obligated to vote. [1 March 2016]  As with the McConnell image, the quotes attributed to Reid were contradictory and presumably based on whatever course of action might be politically expedient for his party rather than on a consistent (non-partisan) political position. The provenance of these statements was also not difficult to ascertain: On 1 March 2016,\u00a0Reid was quoted as follows in an article about Republican opposition to holding nomination hearings for Scalia\u2019s replacement prior to the end of President Obama\u2019s term: Before he traveled along Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House, [Senator] McConnell told House Republicans at their weekly meeting that he\u2019s standing by his promise not to hold hearing or votes on an Obama nominee. Scalia was the leading conservative voice on the bench, and an Obama replacement could give liberals a five-vote majority. The president \u201cmade it very clear\u201d in the meeting that he would consider any nominees recommended by McConnell and Grassley, according to Reid. But the GOP leaders did not offer up a list of names. Asked what leverage Democrats have to force a vote, Reid suggested they would continue to shame Republicans over their stance. \u201cWe have that nasty little Constitution, which says they are obligated to hold hearings and they are obligated to vote,\u201d he said. \u201cThey swore to uphold the Constitution. They\u2019re not doing that. They are walking away from that.\u201d (Technically, the Constitution simply states that the President \u201cshall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint \u2026 Judges of the supreme Court\u201d; that document is silent on whether the Senate is obligated to hold hearings and vote on such nominations.) Evidence of Sen. Reid\u2019s 2005 statements was\u00a0equally easy to come by: During a 19 May 2005 Senate session convened in consideration of the appointment of Priscilla Owen as a judge for the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals (which had, among other similar nominations, been blocked by filibustering Democrats): The Senate continued consideration of the nomination of Priscilla Owen as a judge for the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. She was the first of seven nominations which had been filibustered by the Democrats, the minority party. The Republicans, who held a 55-vote majority, had proposed changing the confirmation process through a ruling from the President of the Senate, upheld by a majority of Senate, that votes on judicial nominees not be subject to a filibuster. This would be a change in the Senate rules which would allow confirmation by a simple majority vote without having to invoke cloture on debate. This was popularly referred to as the \u201cnuclear option\u201d because of its potential impact on the normal procedure of business in the Senate. Debate was evenly divided by time blocks allocated to each party. During those proceedings, Senator Reid maintained the wording of the Constitution did not require that \u201cevery nominee receive a vote\u201d: The duties of the Senate are set forth in the U.S. Constitution. Nowhere in that document does it say the Senate has a duty to give Presidential nominees a vote. It says appointments shall be made with the advice and consent of the Senate. That is very different than saying every nominee receives a vote.", "output": "Images reproduce contradictory statements from U.S. senators Mitch McConnell and Harry Reid about the President's prerogative in appointing Supreme Court justices.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "In April 2018, the right-leaning Turning Point USA posted a Facebook meme which attacked Independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders for once supporting a proposal to \u201cdump nuclear waste\u201d in a \u201cpoor Latino community in Texas\u201d: In the 90\u2019s, Trump supported a bill to dump nuclear waste in Sierra Blanca, a poor Latino community in Texas where the average yearly income was $8,000. When asked if he would visit the site, he said \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d\u00a0 Oh wait! Never mind, that was Bernie Sanders! And he actually co-sponsored the bill! The meme was re-posted by the \u201cCapitalism\u201d Facebook page:  In 1997 and 1998, Sanders did indeed support a measure that gave Congressional approval to an arrangement that would have allowed the states of Maine and Vermont to transport and dispose of nuclear waste at a proposed site in the sparsely populated town of Sierra Blanca in Hudspeth County, close to the Mexican border in West Texas. As the meme suggests, Sierra Blanca was (and is) a predominantly Latino community. U.S. Census Bureau\u00a0records show that in 2000, two years after the proposal, 73 percent of the town\u2019s 533 residents identified as Hispanic or Latino, and almost all of those as Mexican. In 2016, some 69 percent of Sierra Blanca\u2019s 557 residents identified as Hispanic or Latino. In 1999, the annual per capita income of Sierra Blanca residents was $10,768, which was 45 percent lower than that of Texans at large ($19,617). In 2016, the median household income in Sierra Blanca was estimated to be $41,875 as compared to $54,727 in the state of Texas. As an Independent member of the U.S. House of Representatives for Vermont, Sanders was one of 23 co-sponsors of House Resolution 629, which called for Congress to give its consent to the Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Compact \u2014 an agreement between the states of Texas, Maine, and Vermont. Speaking on the floor of the house in October 1997, Sanders said he was in \u201cstrong support\u201d of the resolution for environmental reasons, and stressed that he personally was opposed to the use of nuclear power, but that the waste it produces had to be disposed of as safely as possible. It is worth reading a relatively extensive excerpt from his remarks\u00a0in order to get a good sense of Sanders\u2019 stated reasoning: Let me touch, for a moment, upon the environmental aspects of this issue. And let me address it from the perspective of someone who is an opponent of nuclear power, opposes the construction of nuclear power plants and if he had his way, would shut down the existing nuclear power plants as quickly and as safely as we could. One of the reasons that many of us oppose nuclear power plants is that when this technology was developed, there was not a lot of thought given as to how we dispose of the nuclear waste. But\u2026the reality, as others have already pointed out, is that the waste is here. We can\u2019t wish it away. It exists in power plants in Maine and Vermont, it exists in hospitals, it is here\u2026So the real environmental issue here is not to wish it away, but to make the judgement, the important environmental judgement as to what is the safest way of disposing of the nuclear waste that has been created. \u2026Leaving the radioactive waste at the site where it was produced \u2014 despite the fact that that site might be extremely unsafe in terms of long-term isolation of the waste, and was never intended to be a long-term depository of low-level waste\u00a0 \u2014 is horrendous environmental policy\u2026No reputable scientist of environmentalist believes that the geology of Vermont or Maine would be a good place for this waste. In the humid climate of Vermont and Maine, it is more likely that ground water will come in contact with that waste and carry off radioactive elements to the accessible environment. There is widespread scientific evidence to suggest, on the other hand, that locations in Texas \u2014 some of which receive less than 12 inches of rainfall a year, a region where the groundwater table is more than 700 feet below the surface \u2014 is a far better location for this waste. This is not a political assertion, it is a geological and environmental reality. A video clip of his comments can be viewed\u00a0here. Congress passed the resolution comfortably by 305 votes to 117, as did the Senate, by 78 votes to 15. The proposal had much stronger support among Republicans than among Democrats. GOP members of the House voted 197-26 in favor, while Democrats were more evenly split, voting 107-91 in favor. In the Senate, not a single Republican opposed H.R. 629, while 51 of them voted for it. Fifteen Democratic Senators opposed the bill, while 27 of them voted in support. At that time, five out six Senators from Texas, Vermont, and Maine were Republicans. All five of them voted in favor of the proposal. Both of Maine\u2019s Representatives voted for the disposal site, as did 10 out of the 13 Republican Congress members from Texas. In the House, the proposal had 23 co-sponsors. Eleven were Republicans, eleven were Democrats, and one was Sanders himself, an Independent. The author of the resolution was Joe Barton, a Republican from Texas. Despite Congressional approval for the agreement, authorities in Texas ultimately rejected the proposal to establish a disposal site at Sierra Blanca. In October 1998, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission voted 3-0 against issuing a permit for the construction of a nuclear waste dump there. According to the Associated Press, commission chairman Barry McBee said the disposal site could have provided a much-needed economic boost to the area, but commission members were sufficiently concerned about safety issues to deny the permit. According to a September 1998 article in the Texas Observer, a group of activists opposed to the Sierra Blanca waste site approached Sanders at an anti-nuclear weapons rally in Vermont that year:\u00a0 Sanders left the stage, which surprised no one in the small Texas delegation. Earlier, he had told them, \u201cMy position is unchanged, and you\u2019re not gonna like it.\u201d When they asked if they would visit the site in Sierra Blanca, he said, \u201cAbsolutely not. I\u2019m gonna be running for re-election in the state of Vermont.\u201d We contacted Bill Addison, a leading opponent of the Sierra Blanca proposal, who was identified in the Texas Tribune article as having attended that Springfield rally. He confirmed that he was present and corroborated the article\u2019s account of the activists\u2019 interaction with Sanders. We asked a spokesperson for Sanders whether he agrees that this exchange took place, but we did not receive a response to that specific question. Instead, the spokesperson offered a broader explanation and defense of the Senator\u2019s support of H.R. 629: The only reason Senator Sanders was ever involved is because the constitution requires Congress to approve interstate compacts. Texas Representative\u00a0Joe Barton\u00a0introduced such legislation in 1998, and twenty-three members of the Vermont, Texas and Maine congressional delegations cosponsored it. The bill\u00a0did not endorse a specific site \u2014 in fact, it did not mention Sierra Blanca at all. Nor did the bill override the local and state approval process. In the end, the Texas agency in charge of permitting ruled against the Sierra Blanca site, choosing another site in Texas instead. So, the process worked. The compact, much less the site selection were never Sen. Sanders\u2019 idea. He disagrees with the very premise of the 1980 law that led to the Texas-Vermont-Maine compact, since it put the burden of disposing of low-level waste on the states, rather the nuclear energy companies that produced much of the waste. In fact, he has long been an opponent of nuclear power precisely it produces waste for which we still have no solution (the Texas site is just for low-level contamination \u2014 there is still no plan for all of the high-level nuclear waste all across the country). Sanders\u2019 spokesperson is right to point out that the text of H.R. 629 did not mention Sierra Blanca, but the town was widely known and discussed as the proposed location of the disposal site throughout the time that Sanders and others supported the bill. For example, in April 1998 (three months before Sanders and others in the House voted in favor of H.R. 629) the late Minnesota Senator Paul Wellstone condemned the proposed Sierra Blanca site from the floor of the Senate: What has troubled me from the very beginning is that this legislation would result in the dumping of low-level radioactive waste in a small, poor, majority-Latino community in rural West Texas \u2014 a town called Sierra Blanca. The Texas legislation in 1991 identified the area where the dump will be located. The Texas Waste Authority designated the site near Sierra Blanca in 1992. A draft license was issued in 1996. Whether we like it or not, this knowledge makes us responsible for what happens to Sierra Blanca. The Turning Point USA meme is accurate in claiming that Sanders supported and co-sponsored a proposal that would have seen nuclear waste from Maine, Vermont and (principally) Texas disposed of at a site in Sierra Blanca, and that Sierra Blanca was (and still is) a predominately Latino and relatively poor community. The meme leaves out important and relevant context by failing to mention the key role that Republicans played in crafting and passing that proposal; instead, it singles out Sanders and does not offer the reader any inkling of his environmentalist rationale. Sanders stood to gain politically from supporting a plan that would remove nuclear waste from his constituency, but this does not necessarily mean he wasn\u2019t motivated by a sincere desire to dispose of the waste in a manner and location that he genuinely believed to be safer. However, whether or not you believe his stated rationale was sincere, no proper analysis of a particular politician\u2019s policy position or Congressional vote should leave out the reasons put forward by that politician. Finally, we were not able to corroborate the \u201cAbsolutely not\u201d quotation attributed to Sanders, and his spokesperson did not address our question about it.", "output": "\"Sen.
