But there are a few things in life I'd probably do differently if I had the chance. I once majored in architecture -- something I had been crazy about for as long as I could remember -- and then I suddenly had a change of heart. I made an appointment with my adviser, and told him I was no longer certain I wanted to pursue a career in architecture. \"Don't give up on your childhood dream!\" \"He's right,\" I thought. \"I should just stick it out and I shouldn't disappoint the little girl who once loved architecture.\" It was awful. I was _ , holding on to a childhood dream that had long since faded. When I talked with a friend about it a year later, he asked: \"Right now, what do you want to do with your life?\" That's when I came to the realization that dreams change over time and that you should give up the childhood dream if it's not what you want as an adult. Luckily, it wasn't too late. After some serious thought, I changed my major to journalism. It wasn't something I had always imagined myself pursuing -- but at that moment,  it was what I wanted. We grow up, and sometimes our dreams change -- and that's perfectly OK. You just need to ask yourself every once in a while, \"Is this still what I want?\" If the answer is no, move on and start chasing a new one. \n Question: Why didn't the author change her major immediately? \n Options: (A) Changing a major was uncommon (B) Her advisor forced her not to do that (C) She thought it a betrayal  of her younger self (D) She didn't want her childhood dream to fade. \n Asnwer: C", "output": "Yes", "category": "Question Answering 938.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank, four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\") and the answer to that question.

In the beginning, the games were open only to amateurs. An amateur is a person whose involvement in an activity---from sports to science or the arts---is purely for pleasure. Amateurs, whatever their contributions to a field, expect to receive no form of compensation ; professionals, in contrast, perform their work in order to earn a living. From the perspective of many athletes, however, the Olympic playing field has been far from level. Restricting the Olympics to amateurs has precluded  the participation of many who could not afford to be unpaid. Countries have always desired to send their best athletes, not their wealthiest ones, to the Olympic Games. A slender and imprecise line separates what we call \"financial support\" from \"earning money.\" Do athletes \"earn money\" if they are reimbursed  for travel expenses? What if they are paid for time lost at work or if they accept free clothing from a manufacturer or if they teach sports for a living? The runner Eric Liddell was the son of poor missionaries; in 1924 the British Olympic Committee financed his trip to the Olympics, where he won a gold and a bronze medal. College scholarships and support from the United States Olympic Committee made it possible for American track stars Jesse Owens and Wilma Rudolph and speed skater Dan Jansen to train and compete. When the Soviet Union and its allies joined the games in 1952, the definition of amateur became still muddier. Their athletes did not have to balance jobs and training because as citizens in communist regimes, their government financial support was not considered payment for jobs. In 1971 the International Olympic Committee(IOC) removed the word amateur from the rules, making it easier for athletes to find the support necessary to train and compete. In 1986 the IOC allowed professional athletes into the games. There are those who regret the disappearance of amateurism from the Olympic Games. For them the games lost something special when they became just another way for athletes to earn money. Others say that the designation of amateurism was always questionable; they argue that all competitors receive so much financial support as to make them paid professionals. Most agree, however, that the debate over what constitutes an \"amateur\" will continue for a long time. \n Question: One might infer that   _  . \n Options: (A) developing Olympic-level skills in athletes is costly (B) professional athletes are mostly interested in financial rewards (C) amateurs does not expect to earn money at the sport that is played (D) amateurs have a better attitude than professionals do \n Asnwer: C", "output": "No", "category": "Question Answering 938.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank, four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\") and the answer to that question.

Students don't do any handwriting in this class . Instead , they use palm size , or specially--designed computers. The teacher downloads texts from Internet libraries and sends them to every student's personal computer. Having computers also means that students use the Web. They can look up information on any subject they're studying from maths to social science. High school teacher Judy Herrell in Florida, US, described how her class used the Web to learn about the war in Afghanistan over one year ago. We could touch every side of the country through different sites from the forest to refugee camps, she said .\"Using a book that's three or four years old is impossible.\"And exams can go on line too. At a high school in Tennessee, US, students take tests on their own computers. The teacher records the grades on the network for everyone to see and then copies them to his own electronic grade book. A paperless classroom is a big step towards reducing the waste of paper. High school teacher Stephanie--Sorrell in Kentucky,US, said she used to give about 900 pieces of paper each week to each student. \"Think about the money and trees we could save with the computers,\"she said .But, with all this technology, there is always the risk that the machines will break down.

A new working paper finds that, March and August are the months in which divorce filings peak. For the paper, the University of Washington's Brian Serafini and Julie Brines analyzed the most recent years of divorce filings in Washington and drew their conclusion: divorce rises sharply in March and August. The result is supported by some nation-wide, anecdotal evidence. Online searches for \"divorce\" and \"child custody\"  dramatically grow early in the year, peaking in March, they point out. The authors guess that unhappily married couples schedule their divorce filings around both the winter holidays and Valentine's Day, as well as summer vacations. (More Americans vacation m July than any other month.) There are a few explanations why people might time their marital dissolutions this way, It might just be too difficult to announce a divorce around family-oriented Christmas time, especially if there are kids involved, so many couples weigh the decision to divorce around the new year and progress from there. February is a period in which couples tend to look around for representation on legal sites. And by March, they're prepared to file for divorce. But the authors think the more likely reason is that people decide their differences are irreconcilable right after a big trip. It could be that people don't want to ruin a family getaway, or that vacations are so stressful that they drive the already-dissatisfied to divorce. (\"I told you to pack your suitcase last night; now we've missed the train!\") Then there's the \"broken promise\" theory. \"6People are discontent with their marriages, they look at vacation as an opportunity to give it one last shot, and what they were hoping would happen didn't occur,\" explained Brines, an associate professor of sociology. It's not you; in other words, it's your failure to print the boarding passes. \n Question: Which of the following can support Brian and Julie's conclusion? \n Options: (A) The divorce rate rises sharply in March and August. (B) They carried out online surveys and analyzed the results. (C) More people search for key words about divorce early in the year.

A marvelous opportunity is offered here for you to experience working with these giant animals. The daily highlight is the walk from the elephant orphanage down to the river to bathe the elephants. Imaging what an amazing fun it is to watch an entire herd splashing  around and rolling in the river just feet in front of you! This opportunity is available through a programme designed for visitors and volunteers to work in the world-famous government-run elephant orphanage in Pinnawela, Sri Lanka. The orphanage is regarded as one of the largest centers of its kind in the world, with one of the most successful captive breeding  programmes for Asian elephants. Pinnawela Orphanage is situated in the hills of central Sri Lanka. It was established in 1975 by the Sir Lanka Wildlife Department. The orphanage's 24 acres  are a home for the many baby elephants found in the jungle without their mothers. In most of these cases the mothers had either died or been killed. Baby elephants cared for by the orphanage are released into the wild when they reach a certain age. The volunteers' working hours are quite short so there is plenty of time to sightsee and explore. The volunteer work consists mainly of the day-to-day aspects of running the orphanage, rather than more specialized research-based work. The volunteers' main duties are cleaning the elephant homes in the morning (hard, muddy work!) and bathing some of the smaller elephants. Some elephants are overly large or have not been tamed or trained to a satisfactory level. However there are still enough opportunities to have full hands-on contact safely. While the mahouts are bathing the larger elephants, you will have a chance to relax by the river, chat with the mahouts and watch the elephants play and interact with humans and each other. It is an  ly beautiful sight. Being around these serene animals in such a beautiful setting can have a very calming effect!

This refers to the degree to which we feel ourselves the masters of our lives, contrary to the degree to which we see ourselves as _ to things outside our control. Another way to look at this is to ask how much we see ourselves able to change and act, to choose the course of our lives and relationships. Some have drawn a parallel between the personal responsibility in North American settings and the view itself. The North American view is vast, with large spaces of unpopulated land. The frontier attitude of \"King\" of the wilderness, and the expansiveness of the land reaching huge distances, may relate to generally high levels of confidence in the ability to shape and choose our destinies. In this expansive land, many children grow up with a heroic sense of life, where ideas are big, and hope springs forever. When they experience temporary failures, they are encouraged to redouble their efforts, to \"Try, try again.\" Action, efficiency, and achievement are valued and expected. Free will is respected in laws and enforced by courts. Now consider places in the world with much smaller land, whose history reflects wars and tough struggles: Northern Ireland, Mexico, Israel, Palestine. In these places, destiny's role is more important in human life. In Mexico, there is a history of hard life, fighting over land, and loss of homes. Mexicans are more likely to see struggles as part of their life and unavoidable. Their passive attitude is expressed in their way of responding to failure or an accident by saying \"ni modo\" (\"no way\" or \"tough lick\"), meaning that the failure was destined. This variable is important to understanding cultural conflicts. If someone believing in free will crosses paths with someone more passive, miscommunication is likely. The first person may expect action and responsibility. Failing to see it, he may conclude that the second is lazy, not cooperative, or dishonest. The second person will expect respect for the natural order of things. Failing to see it, he may conclude that the first is forcible, rude, or big headed in his ideas of what can be accomplished or changed. \n Question: The author thinks that one's character is partly determined by   _  . \n Options: (A) physical senses (B) general attitude (C) financial background (D) geographic characteristics \n Asnwer: B", "output": "No", "category": "Question Answering 938.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank, four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\") and the answer to that question.

One of the best ways to practice your English is to speak to a foreigner. You may ask, \"Is it okay to try to talk to foreigners I see in the street?\" The answer is yes and no, but probably no! If you see a foreigner who looks lost, it is polite to ask him, \"May I help you?\" But, otherwise, you should probably let them get on with their business. Situations, however, do exist where it is quite all right to talk to foreigners. If a foreigner enters your school, classroom, office, shop or restaurant, for instance, feel free to ask him (for example): -- What is your name? -- Where do you come from? -- What do you think of Beijing? -- How long will you stay in Beijing? There are also situations where it's okay to talk to foreigners in public places. If you see a foreigner alone in a restaurant, bar or coffee shop, it may be appropriate to ask him or her: -- Is this seat free? -- Do you mind if I talk to you in English? You can probably help them if they are new in China and if they are alone, you may be able to make them feel more welcome. After a few such questions, you should know whether this person wants to talk to you or not. If they ask you similar questions, or if they give long, informative answers, you're in luck. If not, then give them their privacy. Talking to strangers is fun if you choose the right time and place. \n Question: It is the best way to practice your spoken English with   _  . \n Options: (A) Japanese (B) Americans (C) our classmates (D) French people \n Asnwer: B", "output": "Yes", "category": "Question Answering 938.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank, four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\") and the answer to that question.

It's probably the first time that you'll be totally responsible for your own schedule. What if you intend to go to college but just don't feel ready to start yet-for whatever reason-and you don't want to take on a full-time job after graduation? You might want to take a year off to pause and regroup. This practice is common in some countries, like the United Kingdom, where it's called a \" _ \". Taking time off doesn't mean you should ignore the idea of applying to college. In fact, you may want to consider making your college plans before you become involved in other things, especially if you'll be travelling. Apply to schools and make your choice, then ask for a deferred admission. Rachel took a year off and worked in New York City between college and medical school. She says that she had to be extremely well organized about planning for medical school so she didn't miss any of her deadlines. \"Not only did I have to apply to schools and make plans to take my MCAT exams, I also had to make all my living arrangements and other plans for my year off!\" Even if you decide not to apply to college, it can be a great idea to take a year to do something you may not have an opportunity to do again. Lots of volunteer organizations would welcome your time and energy and would provide you with a wonderful learning experience. If you take a year off you will learn some great life skills-like living on a tight budget! If you take a year off you'll pay your way while you are traveling or doing volunteer work. \n Question: What's the best title of the passage? \n Options: (A) Taking Time Off (B) Disadvantages of a \"Gap Year\" (C) Plans after Graduation (D) How to Apply to College \n Asnwer: D", "output": "No", "category": "Question Answering 938.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank, four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\") and the answer to that question.

It is unique in that it is a sport where able and disabled persons, and people as young as 5 years and as old as 80 years of age can participate alongside each other. It is a sport that involves more than one person, and is a wonderful family activity that gathers members together for a day of fun at a favorite waterway. Anyone who has put on water skis can attest to its health benefits--it is a sport that demands and develops strength, agility and endurance. The sport includes several disciplines  including slalom, tricks, cable, jump, ski racing, kneeboard, wakeboard, and barefoot, with each of these practiced for either recreational or competitive enjoyment. Safety Tips for Water-Skiers Don't take unnecessary risks while water-skiing. The following tips will help you safely enjoy this thrilling sport: ALWAYS have an observer in the boat. This is a legal requirement in many states. The boat driver cannot watch the skier and operate the boat safely at the same time. ALWAYS wear a Coast Guard approved Personal Flotation Device (PFD) designed for water skiing. Ski belts are NOT recommended. Your approved PFD will help keep you afloat. NEVER ski in rough water. High waves or a choppy sea will prevent the tow boat from maintaining a steady course and speed. NEVER ski after dark. It is dangerous AND illegal. Any boat traveling fast enough to tow a skier is traveling too fast to navigate safely at night. NEVER water-ski while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Such activity is extremely dangerous because of the impairment to your judgment and ability to respond. A recent study conducted with expert skiers who were purposely drunk indicated that even their ability to ski was dramatically reduced. Use hand signals between the skier and observer. Agree before you start what each signal means so there is no confusion at a critical moment. \n Question: Who can accompany you to go water skiing? \n Options: (A) A pupil in a primary school.

It's not easy to explain why one person is intelligent and another is not, or why one is cooperative and another is competitive. Social scientists are, of course, extremely interested in these types of question. They want to explain why we possess certain characteristics and exhibit certain behaviors. There are no clear answers yet, but two distinct schools of thought on the matter have developed. As one might expect, the two approaches are very different from each other, and there is a great deal of debate between _ of each theory. The argument is often conveniently referred to as nature vs. nurture. Those who support the \"nature\" side of the conflict believe that our personalities and behavior patterns are largely determined by biological and genetic factors. That our environment has little, if anything, to do with our abilities, characteristics and behavior is central to this theory. Taken to an extreme, this theory maintains that our behavior is predetermined to such a great degree that we are almost completely governed by our instincts . Proponents of the \"nurture\" theory, or, as they are often called, behaviorists, claim that our environment is more important than our biologically based instincts in determining how we will act. Behaviorists see humans as beings whose behavior is almost completely shaped by their surroundings. Their view of the human being is quite mechanistic; they maintain that, like machines, humans respond to environmental stimuli (something that helps sb./ sth. to develop better and more quickly)as the basis of their behavior. The social and political connections of these two theories are significant. In the United States, for example, blacks often score below whites on standardized intelligent test. This leads some \"nature\" proponents to conclude that blacks are genetically worse than whites. Behaviorists, in contrast, say that the differences in scores are due to the fact that blacks are often robbed of many of the educational and other environmental advantages  that whites enjoy, and that, as a result ,they do not develop the same responses that whites do. Neither of these theories can yet fully explain human behavior. In fact, it is quite likely that the key to our behavior lies somewhere between these two extremes. That the argument will continue for a long time is certain. \n Question: The author is mainly concerned about solving the problem  _  . \n Options: (A) why our personalities and behaviors differ (B) what makes different stages of intelligence (C) how social scientists form different theories (D) what causes the \"nature/ nurture\" argument \n Asnwer: D", "output": "No", "category": "Question Answering 938.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank, four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\") and the answer to that question.

Over the last 30 years, the number of weather-related disasters has increased quickly, and the disasters have also affected more people and caused more economic loss. However, much of this could be avoided through disaster risk reduction(DRR). A meeting, held in Sendai, Japan last month, opened one day after Cyclone Pam(Pam)hit Vanuatu, which struck the islands with winds of up to 340km/h and destroyed the island nation. The speech by the President of Vanuatu was given shortly after that. He begged the international community for support and stronger commitment  to helping them manage climate and disaster risks. In the face of disasters, it is always the developing countries that suffer most. Damage in these countries is often worse and unluckily, there is limited money and technique to prevent these disasters. In fact, we have seen Asian countries-especially those that have suffered a lot in disasters can't pay the price. Great loss Asia has suffered comes to a total of almost $ 53 billon yearly over the past 20 years. At the same time, studies have shown once again that proper prevention saves lives and damage. With this in mind, people at the Sendai meeting were able to come up with new agreements that effective ways of disaster risk reduction will be carried out in the coming years for those who easily get damaged in disasters. \n Question: We can know from the passage that  _  . \n Options: (A) The Sendai meeting was held one day after a cyclone hit Vanuatu (B) Vanuatu was terribly destroyed by an earthquake (C) The president of Vanuatu begged his country to prevent the disaster (D) Vanuatu is a small island in Japan \n Asnwer: A", "output": "Yes", "category": "Question Answering 938.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank, four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\") and the answer to that question.

We each have just twenty-four hours in a day. Time is not our problems , but what we do with the limited time we have is the issue. Many people spend their days on dozens of activities , but achieve very little because they aren't concentrating on right things. The Pareto Principle, also known as the 80:20 Rule shows us that typically eighty per cent of unfocused effort generates only twenty percent of the results. The remaining eighty per cent of the results are achieved with only twenty percent of the effort . To effectively manage your time, you need to change where you are spending your time. We all have the same amount of time every day. How you spend your time is how you spend your life. Here are time management strategies, which may be helpful. Learn to say no Politely say no should become a habit. Saying no frees up time for the things that are most important. Make a \"to-do\" list    List the tasks that need to be done in order of their importance. Save other less important things for when you have time. Minimize interruption Plan ahead. Think through projects. Look for ways to  _ interruptions. For example, close your door, don't answer the phone or work in a different space.

We forget about all the benefits that we bring to our children when we work - and I'm not talking about the obvious financial benefits, although these of course shouldn't be taken for granted.

It can be a cruel and competitive world out there. Seeking interests, including business, outside of your  kids, can give you that extra idea that you need not care for your kids with attention.

Just off the historic center, Roncs bar is a pub that also hosts live music.  It has the atmosphere of a student party in an old building that might soon be knocked down. Roncs is owned by Hungary's best-known heavy metal rock band, Tankcsapda. Sometimes referred to as the \"Hungarian Metallica\", the band has taken a type of music that is famous worldwide and-through lyrics, album covers, and an annual New Year's party and concert-made it all about their home city. It's perhaps fitting that Tankcsapda should be seen as ambassadors for Debrecen-the city sometimes needs loud heavy metal rock music to get noticed. \"Foreigners think that Hungary is Budapest and there's nothing else,\" is a familiar saying on Debrecen's[:streets. Debrecen has, at times, been more important than the current seat of power, with locals claiming it takes over in times of trouble. That doesn't quite add up. Debrecen survived an attack from the Mongols in the 13th century, the Black Death, 150 years of struggle against the Ottomans and numerous conflicts, and yet it[:has still only briefly been the country's capital twice. This happened for the first time after a short-lived revolution in 1849, and for a second time at the end of World War II. Today, Debrecen may not be well known to tourists, but that only adds to the charm of this relaxed city. It's a small place; the historical center is sized for strolling   and regular cafe stops. There's also a view of Debrecen's mix of architectural styles, a result of the frequent large fires that back in the 19th century led the city's students to form one of Europe's first-ever fire brigades  .

In fact, you should watch what your hands do very carefully. In Arab countries, it is impolite when you eat with your left hand, so don't do it! In all the cultures it is impolite to speak when you are eating. In Ukraine you should not start eating first; you should wait for all the others to start eating with you. You also have to say \"please\" and \"thank you\" every time you ask for and get something. If you don't like some food, don't make faces and don't say: \"Yuk!

Before that, the only transportation was by ferries, which were slow and could be dangerous in winter. The construction of a bridge over the EastRiver had been discussed since the early 19th century, but the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861 _ all consideration of the project. When the war ended in 1865, the bridge became an important issue once more. In 1867, the New York State passed an act setting up the New York Bridge Company for the purpose of constructing a bridge between Manhattan Island and Brooklyn. John Augustus Roebling was chosen to design the bridge. Born in Germany in 1806, he held aggressive views as a student and was listed by the German police as a dangerous figure. He emigrated to America in 1830 to escape political discrimination. Roebling proposed a bridge with a span of 1,500 feet (465 m), with two towers in the East River serving as the main piers.

It is estimated  that over 35 million Americans have physical, mental, or other disabilities. About half of these disabilities are \"developmental\", i.e., they occur before the individual's twenty-second birthday, often from genetic conditions, and are severe enough to affect three or more areas of development, such as mobility, communication, employment, etc. Most other disabilities are considered \"adventitious\", i.e., accidental or caused by outside forces. Prior to the 20th century, only a small percentage of people with disabilities survived for long. Medical treatment for these disabilities was unavailable. Advancements in medicine and social services have created a climate in which people with disabilities can expect to have such basic needs as food, shelter, and medical treatment. Unfortunately, these basics are often not available. Civil liberties such as the right to vote, marry, get an education, and gain employment have historically been denied on the basis of disability. In recent decades, the disability rights movement has been organized to fight against these infringements(;)of civil rights. Congress responded by passing major legislation recognizing people with disabilities as a protected class under civil rights statutes. Still today, people with disabilities must fight to live their lives independently. It is estimated that more than half of qualified Americans with disabilities are unemployed, and a majority of those who do work are underemployed. About two-thirds live at or below the official poverty level. Significant barriers, especially in transportation and public awareness, prevent disabled people from taking part in society. For example, while no longer prohibited by law from marrying, a person with no access to transportation is effectively excluded from community and social activities which might lead to the development of long-term relationships.

Grain was the first domesticated crop that started that farming process. The oldest proven records of brewing are about 6,000 years old and refer to the Sumerians. Sumeria lay between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers including Southern Mesopotamia. It is said that the Sumerians discovered the fermentation   process by chance. No one knows today exactly how this occurred, but it could be that a piece of bread or grain became wet and a short time later, it began to ferment. The Sumerians were able to repeat this process and are assumed to be the first civilized culture to brew beer. They had discovered a \"divine drink\" which certainly was a gift from the gods. The word beer comes from the Latin word bibere, meaning \"to drink\", and the Spanish word cerveza originates from the Greek goddess of agriculture, Ceres. A vitamin-rich porridge, used daily, beer is reported to have increased health and longevity and reduced disease and malnutrition  . The self-medicating properties of alcohol-rich beer also eased the tensions and stresses of daily living in a hostile world. The use of yeast   was not yet known at that time. The success of the fermentation process was left to chance, as the brewers unknowingly relied on yeast particles in the air. Considerable scientific research took place in breweries   in the 19th century. A famous work from 1876 by Louis Pasteur was Studies Concerning Beer where he revealed his knowledge of micro-organisms. By establishing that yeast is a living microorganism, Pasteur opened the gates for accurately controlling the conversion   of sugar to alcohol. Another discovery in beer brewing was the work of Christian Hansen, a Danish scientist, who successfully isolated a single yeast cell and induced it to reproduce on an artificial culture medium. With the resulting yeast multiplication   methods, the purity of the fermenting process has been improved. \n Question: According to the passage, who was the first to brew beer? \n Options: (A) The Greeks.

For an answer,I checked with Tim Flannery,author of The Weather Makers:How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth.In his book,he had challenged readers to make deep cuts in personal emission to keep the world from reaching extremely important _ ,such as the melting  of the ice sheets in Greenland or West Antarctica.\"To stay below that point,we need to reduce CO2emission by 80 percent,\"he said. Good advice,I thought.I'd opened our bedroom windows to let in the wind.We'd gotten so used to keeping our air-conditioning going around the clock.I'd almost forgotten the windows even opened.We should not let this happen again.It's time for us to change our habits if necessary. \n Question: Why did the author and his wife try a new diet? \n Options: (A) To take special kinds of food.

Economists, who generally believe that supply tends to meet demand, have long thought about this question. Even in good times, i.e. not now, there are people who can't find work. And even in bad times, i.e. now, there are job openings. With over 14 million people out of work and looking for a job, you would think every available job would be filled. But that's not the case. Not now and not ever. On Monday, the Nobel Prize committee awarded the prize for economics to the three scholars who have done the most to explain this phenomenon. Two of the winners are Americans, Peter Diamond of MIT and Dale Mortensen of Northwestern. The third winner is Christopher Pissarides, who teaches at the London School of Economics and was born on Cyprus. Like most of economics, what they have found about why the jobless and ready-employers don't find each other seems obvious. You have to find out there is job opening you are interested in. Employers need to get resumes  . It takes a while for both employers and employees to make the decision that this is what they want. And these guys came up with a frame-work to study the problem of why people stay unemployed longer than they should and what can be done about it. So what would today's Nobel Prize winners do to solve the current problem of the unemployed? And does the awarding of the prize contribute to the politicians' lowering joblessness? Speaking from his north London home, Pissarides told The Associated Press the announcement came as \"a complete surprise\" though his work had already helped shape thinking on both sides of the Atlantic. For example, the New Deal for Young People, a British government policy aimed at getting 18-24-year-olds back on the job market after long periods of unemployment, \"is very much based on our work,\" he said. \"One of the key things we found is that it is important to make sure that people do not stay unemployed too long so they don't lose their feel for the labor force,\" Pissarides told reporters in London. \"The ways of dealing with this need not be expensive training - it could be as simple as providing work experience.\" \n Question: According to the writer, which is true about finding jobs? \n Options: (A) It is always difficult to find a job.

Death of a Salesman was created in 1949 by Arthur Miller, who  used it to reveal   the weakness of the \"American Dream\" .The main character, Willy Loman, believes wholeheartedly in American capitalism, and desires to \"succeed\" but his own greed  _ him in the end.Death of a Salesman's first performance was a huge hit on Broadway, where it shocked the American theatre world, and strengthened the 33-year-old Miller's status as a master of American theatre.The play won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, New York Drama Critics' Circle, and the Tony Award for Best Play.The New York Times praised Death of a Salesman as a milestone of 20th century theatre.In 1999, Death of a Salesman received another Tony Award for Best Revival, and the then 83-year-old Miller was given the National Medal of Arts. The 1983 version of Death of a Salesman was directed personally by Arthur Miller on a visit to China, with Beijing director and actor Ying Ruocheng as the main character of Willy Loman.On May 7, 1983, the play was performed for the first time at the Capital Theatre, and the first series of performances lasted until August 18, with over 50 performances, some of which filled the house, and all of which had great influence. When it was first performed here, China didn't have \"salesman\" , so the actors had to use their imagination to represent the characters and American society, and the audiences weren't entirely sure about some information.For example, they couldn't understand what \"fixed payments\" were, or why, if Willy was a lower-class member of American society, his family had a house, car, refrigerator, and television.But this didn't stop the play from becoming a widely-known page in Beijing's theatre history. \n Question: What would be the best title for the passage? \n Options: (A) Death of a Salesman Returns to Beijing (B) Arthur Miller--a master of American theatre (C) Willy Loman--winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Drama (D) Death of a Salesman--a milestone of 20th century theatre \n Asnwer: A", "output": "Yes", "category": "Question Answering 938.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank, four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\") and the answer to that question.

In all , automobiles use up some 70 billion gallons of gas a year. That comes out to be four-and-a-half million barrels a day. The importance of saving gas, then, cannot be stressed too much. Let's say, the fuel used by each car could be cut back just 15 percent. This could be done by making fewer trips each day. It could be done by keeping the automobiles in good shape. It could be done through better driving habits. If these were done, the nation's use of fuel would fall by close to two-thirds of a million barrels per day. Everyone can help to save gas. One way is to ride buses. Some could walk to work. Others could ride their bikes. Another way is to share a ride. People could share cars. About one-third of all cars are used for going to and from work. You can go shopping with a friend from time to time. If two people use a car instead of two, they all save. Driving stress   would be less, too, with fewer cars on the road. The savings on gas around the nation would come to more than one-half million barrels a day. Still another way to save is by cutting out trips one does not need to take. Can you find one car trip per week that could be done by telephone? Can you combine trips? If each car travelled 10 miles less each week, they could save three-and-a-half billion gallons of gas a year. This comes to nearly 5 percent of the total passenger cars demand for gas. The way people drive decides how much fuel they save. Careful drivers may get 20 percent more miles per gallon than ordinary drivers. They obey the 55-mile-per-hour speed limit.

He developed into a world statesman who acted as a kind of conscience to leaders around the globe. Fate initially seemed not to have provided him with a stage on which to achieve more than modest local success. In the first phase of decolonization, Singapore emerged as a part of Malaya. It was cut loose because of tensions between Singapore's largely Chinese population and the Malay majority and, above all, to teach the city a lesson of dependency, _  But great men become such through visions beyond material calculations. Lee challenged conventional wisdom by opting for statehood. The choice reflected a deep faith in the virtues of his people. He asserted that a city located on a sandbar with no economic resource to draw upon, and whose major industry as a colonial naval base had disappeared, could nevertheless thrive and achieve international reputation by building on its principal asset : the intelligence, industry and dedication of its people. A great leader takes his or her society from where it is to where it has never been ---- indeed, where it as yet cannot imagine being. By insisting on quality education, by suppressing corruption and by basing governance on merit. Lee and his colleagues raised the annual per capita income of their population from $500 at the time of independence in 1965 to roughly $55,000 today. In a generation, Singapore became an international financial center., the leading intellectual metropolis of Southeast Asia, the location of the region's major hospitals and a favored site for conferences on international affairs. It did so by adhering to an extraordinary pragmatism: by opening careers to the best talents and encouraging them to adopt the best practices from all over the world.. Superior performance was one component of that achievement. Superior leadership was even more important. As the decades went by, it was moving ---- and inspirational ---- to see Lee., the mayor of a medium-size city, become a mentor of global strategic order. The great tragedy of Lee's life was that his beloved wife was felled by a stroke that left her a prisoner in her body, unable to communicate or receive communication. Through all that time, Lee sat by her bedside in the evening reading to her. He had faith that she understood despite the evidence to the contrary. Perhaps this was Lee Kuan Yew's role in his era.

Our everyday speech is made up in large part of words like probably, many, soon, great, little. What do these words mean?Such verbal expression is not necessarily to be criticized. Indeed, it has a value just because it allows us to express judgments when a precise quantitative statement is out of the question. We have been trying to pin down by experiments what people mean by these expressions in specific contexts, and how the meanings change with age. For instance, a subject is told \"There are many trees in the park\" and is asked to say what number the word many mean to him. Or a child is invited to take \"some\" sweets from a bowl and we then count how many he has taken. We compare the number he takes when he is alone with the number when one or more other children are present and are to take some sweets after him, or with the number he takes when told to give \"some\" sweets to another child. First, we find that the number depends, of course, on the items involved. To most people some friends means about five, while some trees means about twenty. However, unrelated areas sometimes show parallel values. For instance, the language of probability seems to mean about the same thing in predictions about the weather and about politics: the expression \"is certain to\" (rain, or be elected) signifies to the average person about a 70 percent chance; \"is likely to\", about a 60 percent chance; \"probably will\" about 55 percent. Secondly, the size of the population of items influences the value assigned to an expression. Thus, if we tell a subject to take \"a few\" or \" a lot of\" glass balls from a box, he will take more if the box contains a large number of glass balls than if it has a small number. But not proportionately more: if we increase the number of glass balls eight times, the subject takes only half as large a percentage of the total. Thirdly, there is a marked change with age. Among children between six and fourteen years old, the older the child, the fewer glass balls he will take. But the difference between a lot and a few widens with age. This age effect is so consistent that it might be used as a test of intelligence. \n Question: What's the right attitude towards the words like probably, many, soon? \n Options: (A) They are inaccurate and we should avoid them. (B) They are necessary since we cannot be always precise. (C) They should be criticized because there are too many of them.

We kept what we already had, but stopped bringing any more in. because it had coated our lives with toys, and useless stuff. Sometimes I worried about jobs sent overseas, but price triumphed over virtue at our house. We couldn't resist what China was selling. But on that dark Monday last year, an unease feeling washed over me as I sat on the sofa. It wasn't until then that I noticed a fact: China was taking over the place. It stared back at me from the empty screen of the television. I spied it in the pile of tennis shoes by the door. It glowed in the lights on the Christmas tree and watched me in the eyes of a doll lying on the floor, I slipped off the couch and sorted gifts into two piles: China and non-China. The count came to China, 25, the world, 14. Christmas, I realized, had become a holiday made by the Chinese. Suddenly I wanted China out. I persuaded my husband, and on Jan. 1 st, we started a-year-long household embargo on Chinese imports. The idea wasn't to punish China. And we didn't fool ourselves into thinking because we wanted to measure how far it had pushed in. We wanted to know what it would take in time, money, and worry to kick our China habit! In the spring, our 4-year-old son started a campaign to support \"China things\". \"It's too long without China,\" he cried. He kept at me all day. I have discovered for myself that China doesn't control every aspect of our daily lives, but if you take a close look at the underside of boxes in the toy department, I promise it will give you pause. \"When we can buy China things again? Let's never stop.\" My son said. After a year without China I can tell you this: You can still live without it, but it's getting costlier by the day. And a decade from now I may not be brave enough to try it again. \n Question: The best title for the text could be   _  . \n Options: (A) China Free Living: A Trouble One (B) A Year without \"Made in China\" (C) Why I Choose \"Made in China\" (D) \"Made in China\": Good or Bad \n Asnwer: C", "output": "No", "category": "Question Answering 938.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank, four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\") and the answer to that question.

Juno is a Belgian Malinois . The dog was beautiful but was given up by its owners, as they did not want to take on the responsibility. Lucas, a little boy, had a strange illness, a condition that stops the body's ability to process enzymes .As his life continues, he will lose the ability to speak and his physical and mental abilities will degrade till he is left in a vegetative state. The average life expectancy for the patients is 15 years. Chester, the boy's father, wanted his child to enjoy his life on earth as much as possible and looked into getting a service dog for the child. However, Lucas wasn't a good candidate due to his deteriorating abilities, not to mention the $15,000 cost of the animal. Not terrified by all of this, Chester looked into adopting a dog for his son. He found Juno on a website and drove two hours to meet her. Chester had worked with the breed  in the police force and was familiar with how to train them. He put in patience and hard work, and trained Juno while allowing her to become accustomed to Lucas. Now, not only will Juno not leave Lucas' side, she is also helping with his illness. Chester said, \"She has the ability to notice his neurological changes. Now she reminds us when Lucas is about to have a seizure  or if his oxygen levels drop really low. She has saved him several times.\" Companion animals are beautiful things and they establish a bond that can't be described without experiences.

Other people have such unusual hobbies that no one else can share them. Sometimes they try to do something better, faster or longer than anyone else in order to have their names included in the Guinness Book of World Records. A lady in Massachusetts may have the world's easiest hobby; she let her hair grow. Diane Witt has not cut her hair for twelve years. It is now eight feet (2.44 meters) long, and she will soon set a new world record and her name will be placed in the Guinness Book.

A teacher in California typed for over 162 hours, and a lady from Iowa spend six years typing the numbers from one to one million. Probably the cleanest people in the world are two young women from England who stayed in the shower for over ninety-eight hours; but a man in Oregon was more than twice as clean after taking a shower that lasted two hundred hours.

The technique, described in the journal   Nature, uses a thermal camera   to detect the sudden shift of blood flow in the face. The system performed as a traditional polygraph  , the scientists report. Pushed by technological advances and with fresh interest since Sept.11, the discovery is part of the development in the scientific study of detection. Although the lie remains a mysterious phenomenon, researchers in recent years have found a number of new methods that might take the place of the polygraph, from brain scans, to slight changes in eye movement, to sparks of electrical activity that signal a person has seen a victim or a crime scene before. The new finding says, when a person tells a lie, there is a sudden change of blood to the area around the eyes. Although the change is not ordinary visible, the blood warms the skin, causing bands of color1 to appear through a camera sensitive to heat.  One advantage of the camera can provide answers quickly, and doesn't require a highly trained expert to operate it or explain its results. In theory, this new technology could be used anywhere large numbers of people need to be quickly screened. But some scientists say the technology would need to be improved before it is ready for use, for it is possible that there are other reactions that cause a sudden change in blood flow in the face and there is also the danger that people will learn to fool the machine, the same way they try to fool polygraph examiners by controlling their breathing or taking drugs to relax themselves. \n Question: Compared with a traditional polygraph, the new tool's progress lies in the fact that   _  . \n Options: (A) it is moveable (B) it is easier to operate (C) it gives correct conclusion (D) it can only be used in public places. \n Asnwer: D", "output": "No", "category": "Question Answering 938.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank, four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\") and the answer to that question.

In reality, art crimes are no less interesting and exciting. According to The New York Times, over the past 15 years, Glafira Rosales fooled two local commercial art galleries into buying 63 false works of art for more than $30 million.She passed off fake paintings as works by 20th century modernist masters such as American artists Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock.But in fact, these so called \"newly discovered works\" were all produced by a single man, a Chinese immigrant named Qian Peishen. The art world was shocked by Rosales' deception.But to the public, it was amusing and most satisfying to see wealthy people get tricked. So what decides the value of a piece of art? Is it beauty? Is it the artist's talent and craftsmanship? Or is it just because the artist is famous? We should take beauty out. If the buyers were buying paintings only for their beauty, they'll be content displaying good fakes on their walls. They wouldn't be so upset when a forgery is exposed. The art market claims that great artists are inimitable, and that this inimitability justifies the absurd price of their works. We can't deny that most famous artists are good at what they do, but forgers like Qian show that their works are imitable.Otherwise, the difference between the original and the copycats would be obvious and Rosales would not be able to fool anyone. According to an article in the Economist, expensive paintings are what economists call positional goods. They are valuable because other people can't have them. With other goods, a higher price reduces demand.But art turns down the laws of economics. \"When the goods that is really being purchased is evidence that the buyer has paid a lot, price increases cause demand to boom,\" explained the article. That's why scarcity and authenticity are so important in the art market. Artists sometimes forget this.Demien Hirst, the British pop artist, is famous for his spot paintings. But they dropped in value when it became clear that they had been produced in quantities so vast that nobody knew how many were out there.The art market lost faith in these paintings because no one could be sure which of them were authentic and which were fake. \n Question: Who is amused and satisfied to see the rich buy forged works of art? \n Options: (A) The public.

Like a lot of people who want to get through a checkout line, my thoughts were on speed, nothing more. The line I was standing in wasn't moving as quickly as I wanted, and I glanced toward the cashier. There stood a man in his seventies. Of average build, he wore glasses and a nice smile. I thought, \"Well, he's an old guy and it probably takes him a little longer to get the chores done.\" For the next few minutes I watched him. He greeted every customer before he began scanning the items they were purchasing. Sure, his words were the usual, \"How's it going?\" But he did something different--he actually listened to people. Then he would respond to what they had said and engage them in brief conversation. I thought it was strange, but I guess I had grown accustomed to people asking me how I was doing simply out of a robotic conversational habit. After a while, you don't give any thought to the question and just mumble something back. I could say, \"I just found out I have six months to live,'' and someone would reply, \"Have a great day!'' This old cashier had my attention. He seemed genuine  about wanting to know how people were feeling. And after giving them the change, the old cashier looked the customers in the eyes. \"I sure want to thank you for shopping here today, ''he told them. \"You will have a great day.

In his book The Natural History of Selbourne (1786), the naturalist Gilbert White tells how he _ removed one egg a day from a kind of bird Plover's nest, and how the mother laid another egg each day to make up for the missing one. He notes that other kinds of birds ignore the loss of a single egg, but if more than one egg has been removed, they will give up their nests. It has also been noted that a certain type of bees always provides five--never four, never six--caterpillars   for each of their eggs so that their young have something to eat when the eggs have hatched out. Research has also shown that both mice and pigeons can be taught to distinguish between odd   and even   numbers of food pieces. These have led some people to think that creatures can actually count. They also point to dogs that have been taught to respond to questions about numbers with the correct number of barks. Animals respond to quantities only when they are connected to survive as in the case of the eggs, or survive as in the case of food. They can \"count\" only when the objects are present and only when the numbers involved are small--no more than seven or eight. In lab experiments, animals which are trained to count one kind of objects were unable to count any other type. What interests them are the objects, not the numbers. Animals' achievements simply are not equal to evidence of counting.

Thanks to modern technology, we have been able to increase greatly the efficiency of our work force. New machines and new methods have helped cut down time and expense while increasing overall output. This has meant more production and a higher standard of living. For most of us in America, modern technology is thought of as the reason why we can have cars and television sets. However, technology has also increased the amount of food available to us, by means of modern farming machinery and animal breeding techniques, and has extended our life span via  medical technology. Will mankind continue to live longer and have a higher quality of life? In large measure the answer depends on technology and our ability to use it widely. If we keep making progress as we have over the past fifty years, the answer is definitely yes. The advancement of technology depends upon research and development, and the latest statistics  show that the United States is continuing to pump billions of dollars annually  into such efforts. So while we are running out of some scarce resources  we may well find technological substitutes for many of them through our research programs. Therefore, in the final analysis the three major factors of production(land, labor and capital) are all influenced by technology. When we need new skills, on techniques in medicine, people will start developing new technology to meet those needs. As equipment proves to be slow or inefficient, new machines will be invented.
