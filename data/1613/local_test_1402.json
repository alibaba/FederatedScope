Years later, Thomas is a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department. Two angels fall to Earth: one, Simon, enters Thomas' home and warns him of coming events, before disappearing. The second, Uziel, a lieutenant of the angel Gabriel, is killed in an altercation with Simon. Investigating the disturbance, Thomas finds in Simon's apartment the obituary of a recently deceased Korean War veteran named Colonel Arnold Hawthorne and the theology thesis about angels which Thomas himself wrote in seminary. Meanwhile, in Chimney Rock, Arizona, Simon finds the dead veteran awaiting burial and sucks the evil soul out of the body.The medical examiner informs Thomas that Uziel's body is like nothing he has seen before: it has no eyes, no signs of bone growth, hermaphroditism, and the same blood chemistry as an aborted fetus. Among the personal effects found on the body is an ancient, hand-written Bible, which includes an extra chapter of the Book of Revelation that describes a second war in heaven and prophecy that a \"dark soul\" will be found on Earth and used as a weapon.Unknown to Thomas, Gabriel arrives on Earth. Needing a human helper, Gabriel catches Jerry, a suicide, in the moment of his death and keeps him in a state of limbo. Unhappily dominated by Gabriel, Jerry retrieves Uziel's belongings from the police station while Gabriel destroys Uziel's body in the morgue. After finding Hawthorne's obituary, Gabriel and Jerry head for Chimney Rock. Before Gabriel arrives, at the local reservation school Simon hides Hawthorne's soul in a little Native American girl, Mary, who immediately falls ill and is taken care of by her teacher, Katherine.After finding Uziel's burnt body, all evidence of its oddity now lost, Thomas hurries to Chimney Rock. When Gabriel realizes Hawthorne's soul is missing, he confronts Simon. Gabriel says Hawthorne's soul will tip the balance to whichever side possesses it. Should the rebellious angels win, Heaven will become like Hell with earth in its thrall. Simon refuses to reveal its location, and Gabriel kills him, ripping out his heart. Mary shows signs of possession by the evil soul; she suddenly recounts an incident from Hawthorne's harrowing war experiences in first-person perspective. Meanwhile, Thomas examines Simon's remains and questions Katherine. In Hawthorne's home, he finds evidence of war crimes. Thomas visits a church to reflect and is shaken by a verbal confrontation with Gabriel. He is beginning to understand the nature of the jealous angels who hate humans because God loves them most.At school, Katherine finds Gabriel questioning the children. After he leaves, she rushes to Mary's home and finds Thomas there. As Mary's condition worsens, Katherine takes Thomas to an abandoned mine where she had seen Gabriel. Inside, they find angelic script and experience together a terrible vision of the angelic war. They rush back to Mary's home, only to find Gabriel and Jerry there. Thomas kills Jerry, who thanks him for the release. Katherine stops Gabriel temporarily when her wild gunshot misses him and blows up Mary's trailer home. The three protagonists flee to a Native American site where Mary can be exorcised. In a hospital ICU ward, Gabriel recruits a new unwilling assistant, Rachel, just as she dies of a terminal illness. He needs her because he doesn't know how to drive.That night, Lucifer confronts Katherine and tells her that \"other angels\" have taken up this war against mankind, and since then, no human souls have been able to enter Heaven. He knows of Gabriel's plot to use Hawthorne's soul to overthrow the obedient angels, and he knows that if Gabriel wins, under his influence Heaven will ultimately devolve into another Hell. That's unwanted competition. The next day, Lucifer appears to Thomas and advises him to use Gabriel's lack of faith against him. Gabriel arrives and attempts to disrupt the exorcism ritual. Thomas kills Rachel, and he and Katherine fight Gabriel.Lucifer appears first encouraging the tribe to complete the exorcism. Then he confronts Gabriel telling him that his war is based upon arrogance, which is evil, making it Lucifer's territory. Gabriel taunts Lucifer about his past when he fell from grace; Lucifer tells Gabriel he needs to go home and rips out his heart. Simultaneously Mary expels out Hawthorne's soul, a rancid cloud of evil. The \"enemy ghost\" starts to attack the people but a bright light from Heaven immediately destroys it. With the threat to his evil kingdom eliminated, Lucifer tells Thomas and Katherine to \"come home\" with him. They staunchly refuse. \"I have my soul...and my faith,\" declares Thomas. Lucifer drags Gabriel to Hell. As morning comes, Thomas comments on the nature of faith and what it means to truly be human.", "output": "Question: Who shows signs of possession?, Answer: Mary shows signs of being possessed., Question: Who blew up Mary's trailer home?, Answer: Katherine., Question: Who killed Jerry?, Answer: Thomas., Question: Why do the angels hate humans?, Answer: The angels hate humans because God loves them the most., Question: Who does Lucifer tell to \"come home\" with him?, Answer: Thomas and Katherine, Question: Is Thomas Dagget able to keep his faith?, Answer: no, Question: Is Thomas Dagget Lutheran or Catholic?, Answer: Catholic, Question: Who's soul is missing?, Answer: Hawthorne's soul is missing and Gabriel is the one who discovers it., Question: What career path does Thomas Dagget eventually choose?, Answer: a detective with the Los Angeles police department, Question: Who appears to Thomas?, Answer: Lucifer, Question: Whom did Katherine find at school questioning the children?, Answer: Gabriel., Question: The medical examiner says Uziel's body has the same blood chemistry as what?, Answer: Aborted fetus, Question: why does Gabriel need a new assistant?, Answer: He doesn't know how to drive, Question: Who does Simon kill in an altercation?, Answer: Uziel, Question: What did Katherine and Thomas find in the abandoned mine?, Answer: Angelic script., Question: What kind of a student is Thomas Dagget?, Answer: a seminary student, Question: Who wrote the theology thesis Simon finds?, Answer: Thomas., Question: After Gabriel leaves, where did Katherine rush off to?, Answer: Mary's house., Question: What is happening to Hawthornes soul?, Answer: His soul will tip the balance to whichever side possesses it., Question: Whose soul does Mary expel?, Answer: Hawthorne's, Question: What is found on Uziel's body?, Answer: Bible, Question: What does Garbriel want to use in the war?, Answer: Hawthorne's soul, Question: Lucifer tells Gabriel his war is based upon what?, Answer: Arrogance, Question: Does Thomas know Gabriel's arrival?, Answer: No, Question: What is Gabriel's plot?, Answer: To use Hawthorne's soul to overthrow the obidient angels, Question: Who kills Jerry?, Answer: Thomas, Question: Who is at war with mankind?, Answer: Angels, Question: Where do Katherine and Thomas see the vision of the angelic war?, Answer: in a mine, Question: Where does Thomas go to reflect?, Answer: Church, Question: What does Lucicer advise Thomas to do?, Answer: Use Gabriel's lack of faith against him, Question: Who has a verbal confrontation at a church?, Answer: Thomas and Gabriel have a verbal confrontation at a church., Question: Who does Thomas kill?, Answer: Rachel, Question: Who drags Gabriel to Hell?, Answer: Lucifer, Question: What does Gabriel rip from Simon?, Answer: Heart, Question: Who kills Rachel?, Answer: Thomas, Question: What does Lucifer tell Katherine?, Answer: Other angels have taken up this war against mankind, Question: What does Lucifer tell Gabriel his war is based upon?, Answer: Arrogance, Question: Which angel enters Thoma's home?, Answer: Simon, Question: Who's body is found before heading to Chimney Rock?, Answer: Thomas finds Uziel's burnt body and races to Chimney Rock., Question: What does Lucifer first appear encouraging the tribe to complete?, Answer: Exorcism, Question: What does Thomas see a vision of a war between?, Answer: Angels., Question: Where did Katherine take Thomas to?, Answer: An abandoned mine., Question: Who does Lucifer drag to Hell?, Answer: Gabriel, Question: Who do Thomas and Katherine fight?, Answer: Gabriel, Question: Is Uziel killed?, Answer: yes, Question: Where does Thomas hurry to after finding Uziel's body?, Answer: Chimney Rock, Question: Who does Lucifer confront?, Answer: Katherine, Question: Who keeps Jerry in a state of limbo?, Answer: Gabriel, Question: A bright light from where destroys the \"enemy ghost\"?, Answer: Heaven", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

She then murders a man by slicing through his femoral artery and then throwing him off the roof of the club. The following day she attends a ceremony where she watches Danni Rodgers, a nurse she had been mentoring, graduate. She then approaches her and meets Danni's mother and stepfather Larry Cook. Despite this joyful moment and all of her preparation, Danni is ill prepared for her first true day of nursing duty and is berated by Dr. Morris for her inability to respond quickly to an emergency situation. Abby views the situation with disgust, as she knows that Dr. Morris is a sadist that enjoys harassing new nurses.Abby is further irritated when Danni chooses to call her paramedic boyfriend Steve for support rather than approaching Abby herself. She's pleased when Danni's call to Steve ends badly due to a fight the couple had had previously that night over Danni's refusal to move in with him. She explains her actions to Abby by saying that she is unwilling to trust her stepfather enough to leave him alone with her mother. This distrust is later justified when Abby and Danni witness her stepfather having an affair while the two women are on their way to go drinking at a nightclub. Danni is upset at the encounter, which makes her more willing to drink later that night. However unbeknownst to her Abby spikes her drink with drugs, which enables Abby to get Danni to have sex with both her and random strangers. The next day Danni wakes to find herself in Abby's apartment and leaves despite Abby's entreaties for Danni to skip work and spend the day with her. After she leaves, Abby downloads several photos that she had taken from the previous night before leaving to see a psychiatrist, which is revealed to be Larry.Abby seduces Larry by saying that she's addicted to men, alluding to her past history with her father. He gives her his phone number to contact him anytime she wishes, which seems to confirm Abby's suspicions that Larry is a cheater. She later approaches him while he's leaving his office and convinces him to give her a ride, which enables her to murder him by paralyzing him in his car with vecuronium bromide and putting it in reverse, which causes him to get into a car accident. After hearing of her stepfather's death Danni seeks solace from Abby, only for Abby to grow angry when Danni says that she's going to move in with her boyfriend. Abby comments that she hopes that Larry's genitals were cut off in the car crash, only for Danni to reveal that she had never told Abby how her stepfather had died and quickly leave. This infuriates Abby, who decides that instead of seeking to help Danni, she will now hurt her. She accomplishes this by slowly convincing Detective John Rogan that Danni is mentally unstable and obsessed with Abby.The next day, Abby runs into Rachel Adams, a new human resources employee that remarks that Abby greatly resembles a girl she knew that was sent to a mental institution. Abby invites Rachel out for drinks and takes the opportunity to harass Danni by calling her via Skype and showing Danni a video of Abby injecting chemicals into Rachel. Danni tries to go to the police, only for Detective Rogan to dismiss her claims as evidence of her trying to hurt Abby because the other woman didn't return her affections. He uses the photographs Abby took as proof to this effect, which Steve sees as a result of Danni calling him to the police station for support. This prompts an argument between the two and Steve leaves in a fit of anger. Danni tries to approach Dr. Morris for help, only for him to use this as an opportunity to blackmail Abby into having sex with him. Abby initially pretends to agree to this arrangement but soon shows that it was only a way for her to get him alone so she could dismember and murder him. That same night Abby also knocks out Rachel and drags her away to her death.Danni goes to the mental institution that Rachel had referred to, seeking answers about what is going on. There, she learns about Sarah Price, a little girl who killed her father after witnessing him not only having an affair but also severely beating her mother for coming to his office unannounced. Danni also discovers that Sarah was taken in by one of the nurses at the institution, a woman named Abigail Russell. Danni then realizes that Abby is Sarah and has since taken the name of her caretaker. Danni then tries to call Rachel to warn her about Abby, only to find that Rachel's phone is in her car. She then receives a call from Abby, who implies that she will kill Steve in the same manner as Rachel.Danni rushes to the hospital, where she and Abby begin to fight. The staff initially tries to intervene, only for Abby to set off on a killing spree and lock herself into a lab. Danni and Steve finally manage to get inside, only for Abby (who had hidden in one of the patients' beds) to stab Steve in the neck and run off. Abby rushes home to grab some essentials but is confronted by Detective Rogan, who tries to arrest her. Noticing that her neighbor Jared is viewing the situation, Abby pretends that Rogan is trying to rob her. Her neighbor then comes outside and hits the detective over the head with a bat, killing him instantly. Her neighbor is horrified to discover that Rogan is a cop, but Abby convinces him to hide the body, saying that Rogan was corrupt and that Jared would be treated badly since he is now a cop killer.Abby, having fled, is shown to have assumed a new identity, that of human resources employee Rachel Owen.", "output": "Question: Before throwing a man off the roof of the club, how does Abby murder him?, Answer: Slicing through femoral artery, Question: What does Abby narrate that her \"job\" is?, Answer: Murder cheating men, Question: Which detective dismisses Danni's claims?, Answer: Detective Rogan, Question: What prompted Abby to kill Larry?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Who works in human resources?, Answer: Rachel Adams, Question: From whom does Danni receive a phone call from?, Answer: Abby, Question: Where is Abby at as the film opens?, Answer: Night club, Question: What does Abby know know Dr. Morris enjoys?, Answer: Harassing new nurses, Question: Who is Larry?, Answer: Psychiatrist, Question: Does Danni try to go to the police?, Answer: Yes, Question: What is the name of the psychiatrist that Abby leaves to see?, Answer: Larry, Question: Who harasses Danni by calling her via Skype?, Answer: Abby, Question: Where does Abby lock herself after her killing spree?, Answer: A lab, Question: Who is Danni berated by?, Answer: Dr. Morris, Question: What does Abby explain her job is?, Answer: Murder cheating men, Question: What made Danni suspicious of Abby?, Answer: Abby shouldn't have known how Larry died as Danni never shared that info with her., Question: What does Dr. Rogan do when Danni asks him for help?, Answer: Tries to blackmail Abby into having sex with him, Question: What was the plot twist?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Who invites Rachel out for drinks?, Answer: Abby, Question: What does Steve do for a living?, Answer: Paramedic, Question: Why did Danni go to the mental insitution?, Answer: Danni went to the mental institution to seek answers about what was going on, Question: To whom does Danni try to report Abby?, Answer: Detective Rogan, Question: Who is rushed to the hospital?, Answer: Danni., Question: Who is Steve to Danni?, Answer: Boyfriend, Question: Who spikes Danni's drink?, Answer: Abby, Question: Who is the new human resources employee?, Answer: Rachel Adams, Question: Who tries to arrest Abby?, Answer: Detective Rogan., Question: Who runs into Rachel Adams?, Answer: Abby, Question: Who does Danni call to warn about Abby??, Answer: Rachel, Question: What does Abbey pretend is happening to her while her neighbor Jared watches?, Answer: She is being robbed by Detective Rogan, Question: Who does Danni fight with at the hospital?, Answer: Abby., Question: What is Abby's new identity?, Answer: Rachel Owen, Question: What does Abby download?, Answer: Photos, Question: What does Abby spike?, Answer: Drink, Question: What profession does Steve have?, Answer: Paramedic, Question: Who berates Danni on her first day of work as a nurse?, Answer: Dr. Morris, Question: What is the name of Danni's stepfather?, Answer: Larry Cook, Question: Who locks herself in a lab?, Answer: Abby., Question: What substance was used to paralyze Karry?, Answer: vecuronium bromide, Question: Who took in Sarah Price?, Answer: Sarah Price was taken in by Abigail Russell, Question: Who is having the affair?, Answer: Stepfather, Question: What place did Rachel refer Danni to?, Answer: A mental institution, Question: Who did Sarah Price kill?, Answer: Her father, Question: Whose name did Sarah take?, Answer: Abigail Russell, Question: Who stabs Steve in the neck?, Answer: Abby., Question: Whose phone does Abby take?, Answer: Rachel, Question: What is the detective's name?, Answer: Rogan., Question: What artery does Abby slice on a man, before throwing him off the roof?, Answer: Femoral, Question: Who is Abbey confronted by when she rushes home?, Answer: Detective Rogan", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

The men take the train, securing a group of hostages, whom they isolate in one car of the train, then disconnect this car from the rest of the train.Meanwhile, Lieutenant Zachary Garber (Walter Matthau), a cynical and curmudgeonly yet light-hearted New York City Transit Authority police lieutenant, begins his day by leading four visiting Tokyo Metro directors on a tour of New York's subway command-center. This is interrupted by Blue's radio announcement to the command center that \"your train has been taken.\" Blue (Robert Shaw), the British-accented leader of the hijackers, tells Garber they are demanding a ransom of one million dollars, to be delivered to them within one hour; otherwise they will kill one passenger per minute, starting when the hour has passed.Garber, the sarcastic Lieutenant Rico Patrone (Jerry Stiller), and other transit workers cooperate while trying to guess how the criminals intend to escape the subway tunnel and get away. Various clues soon surface for Garber to figure out, first with his hearing Blue's very distinctive English accent over the radio. It later turns out that Blue was a ruthless British mercenary, and Green (Martin Balsam) is a former transit worker who from time to time sneezes over the radio and is heard by Garber, who responds by saying \"Gesundheit.\" Garber also learns that one of the hostages is an undercover police officer.The mayor finally agrees to pay the ransom at the urging of his deputy mayor. The police dispatch a squad car carrying the ransom money. When the car is wrecked in a collision, Garber daringly bluffs to buy some time, telling the takers that the money already has been delivered to the 28th Street Station and only the walk down the tunnel is delaying it. A reluctant Blue agrees to the delay.A police motorcycle completes the trip from the scene of the collision to the subway station and two unarmed officers are sent down the track on foot to deliver the money to the hijackers. With the money finally in hand, the hijackers demand that electric power be restored to the subway line, and that all signals in the path of the train be turned green from 28th Street to the South Ferry station, both of these being necessary for the car to move. Having overridden the subway car's dead-man's switch, which would otherwise ensure its stopping unless someone remained at the throttle, the hijackers get off the train and set it in motion. As the train starts to move, the undercover officer also jumps off the train and hides between the rails. The car begins to travel faster and faster, since no one is controlling its speed.Outside the tunnel, Garber and Inspector Daniels are convinced that the runaway train is a diversion and that the hijackers must have left the train.The hijackers divide the ransom money, discard their disguises, and start their escape into the tunnel's emergency exit; however, Grey refuses to leave his gun behind as agreed and is shot dead by Blue. The undercover officer, still hiding in the tracks, manages to kill Brown with one shot. Green escapes onto the street.Garber arrives after Green has gotten away and, drawing on Blue, orders him to surrender just as Blue is about to shoot the undercover officer. Blue asks Garber if the death penalty is available in the state of New York anymore. Told that it is not, Blue responds, \"Pity\", then promptly electrocutes himself by stepping onto the third rail while a horrified Garber watches.Entering the South Ferry Loop, the runaway car finally encounters a red signal. The car's emergency brakes are tripped and it grinds to a halt; the remaining hostages are all safe.Green, the only hijacker to escape, has left as a clue only Garber's surmise that one of the hijackers must be an ex-motorman of the New York Transit Authority (owing to the hijackers' knowledge of the car's operation). With the dead three all identified, Garber realizes that the hijacker still at large must be the former transit employee. Garber and Patrone, working their way through a list of former motormen \"discharged for cause\" (and, by implication, disgruntled), pay a visit to Harold Longman. Longman, known to the audience as Mr. Green, is shown rolling in the packs of ransom money on the bed in his seedy efficiency apartment when Garber and Patrone knock on his door. He hides the money quickly, then opens to the officers and bluffs his way through their questioning. The officers find Longman's alibi weak, but start out the door, until Longman sneezes and Garber says \"Gesundheit.\" Garber then re-opens the door, the expression on his face in the door opening (the film's final frame) telling the audience that he knows he has just found the final hijacker.", "output": "Question: Do the hostages survive?, Answer: some, Question: what is zachary garber's profession?, Answer: Police Lt., Question: Who doe Grey get in a stand-off with?, Answer: Blue, Question: how does blue die?, Answer: Blue electrocutes himself by stepping onto the third rail., Question: Where does the runaway train finally stop?, Answer: South Ferry Loop, Question: Who agrees to pay ransom?, Answer: Garber, Question: Who does Garber and Patrone pay a visit to?, Answer: Harold Longman, Question: Who kills Brown?, Answer: Mr Blue, Question: What kind of accent does Blue have?, Answer: British, Question: Who decides to confront the hijacker himself?, Answer: Garber, Question: Where does electric power have to be restored?, Answer: To make the train car move, Question: who does garber conclude the remaining hijacker must be?, Answer: A disgruntled transit worker named Blue., Question: Who tells the hijacker the money has been delivered?, Answer: Garber, Question: who has a cold?, Answer: Green has a severe cold., Question: who kills the conductor?, Answer: Blue kills the conductor., Question: Who is the sarcastic lieutenant?, Answer: Rico Patrone, Question: Who plays Rico Patrone?, Answer: Jerry Stiller, Question: What does Grey do?, Answer: Refuses to leave his gun behind., Question: WHAT IS GARBER'S FIRST DEMAND AFTER RECEIVING THE MOENY?, Answer: To walk down the tunnel., Question: Who gave Garber the demands?, Answer: Blue, Question: in what city does the movie take place?, Answer: New York City, Question: Who does Jerry Stiller play?, Answer: Lieutenant Rico Patrone, Question: Who has an English accent?, Answer: blue, Question: WHAT IS BLUE'S SECOND DEMAND?, Answer: That electric power be restored to the subway line, Question: Who jumps off the train and hides?, Answer: The undercover officer, Question: Where does the runaway car stop?, Answer: south ferry station, Question: Who wins the stand off with Grey and Blue?, Answer: Blue, Question: Who kills Grey?, Answer: Blue, Question: Who plays Grey?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Who must be cleared from the tunnel?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: What must all the signals on the path be set to?, Answer: green, Question: Who do they take hostage in addition to passengers?, Answer: an undercover police officer, Question: Who is the leader of the hijackers?, Answer: Mr. Blue, Question: WHO JUMPS OFF THE TRAIN AND HIDES?, Answer: the undercover officer, Question: What is safety device requiring a motorman to continually press down on the throttle or else the train will stop?, Answer: dead-man's switch", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

He later meets a homeless Vietnam veteran, John Bubber, tells him about the rescue at the crash site and gives him his remaining shoe. When a television station offers $1 million to the \"Angel of Flight 104\", Bernie cannot claim the reward, due to his arrest while fencing credit cards he stole from the people he rescued. Bubber, however, uses the single shoe to take credit for the act. Bernie tries to tell people that Bubber is a fake, but the media has sensationalized the heroic Bubber, and everyone wants to believe in him rather than Bernie.TV reporter Gale Gayley, one of the crash survivors, considers herself to be in Bubber's debt and soon grooms his public image. He turns out to be a decent person, using his notoriety and reward money to help the homeless and sick children. She finds herself falling in love with him even though she has questions about his authenticity, and he finds himself in an ethical dilemma since his lies are inspirational to countless people. Meanwhile, Bernie continues to aggravate ex-wife Evelyn and fails to bond with his son, who is now enamored with the \"hero\" Bubber. Bernie begins to feel that if his son is going to idolize anyone, perhaps Bubber is the better choice.A detective tells Gale her credit cards were recovered during Bernie's arrest. Gale and her cameraman, Chucky, break into Bernie's apartment with the help of the landlord, Winston. While searching for evidence to incriminate Bernie, Gale finds a stolen Silver Microphone Award that she won in New York City, the night before the crash. Bernie arrives only to be confronted by Gale, who concludes that Bubber stole her purse in a moment of weakness during the rescue, sold it to Bernie, and accuses Bernie of attempting to now blackmail Bubber. They are interrupted by Winston, who says Bubber is on television, about to jump from a high-rise skyscraper. Gale rushes there and brings Bernie along, threatening to have Bernie prosecuted if Bubber leaps to his death. In addition, she demands Bernie apologize for the attempted blackmail. Bernie's wife and son rush there as well, with Evelyn reminiscing how Bernie is selfish and cynical, but always becomes a great human being in a crisis.When they arrive, Bernie goes out on the ledge, hatching a scheme to milk the media attention for all its worth. Ultimately, he convinces Bubber that the world needs a hero, and that Bubber is clearly the right guy for the job, though he does negotiate a discreet share of the $1 million. When Bernie slips off the ledge, Bubber grabs him and pulls him to safety, a (true) hero once more. When she sees Bernie's face with dirt on it, as on the night of the crash, Gale realizes it was Bernie who saved her. She confronts him \"off the record\" with her supposition, but Bernie insists that Bubber was the hero. As she leaves, however, she thanks him for saving her life; Bernie finally replies, \"You're welcome.\" Gale tells Bernie to tell his son the truth.

He heads to New York City hoping to succeed as a male prostitute for women. Initially unsuccessful, he succeeds in bedding a well-to-do middle-aged New Yorker (Sylvia Miles), but Joe ends up giving her money.Joe then meets Enrico Salvatore \"Ratso\" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), a street con man with a limp who takes $20 from Joe by offering to introduce him to a known pimp (John McGiver). Joe flees the encounter in pursuit of Ratso. Joe spends his days wandering the city and sitting in his hotel room. Soon broke, he is locked out of his hotel room and most of his belongings are impounded.He tries to make money by agreeing to receive oral sex from a young man (Bob Balaban) in a movie theater. When Joe learns that the young man has no money, Joe threatens him and asks for his watch, but eventually lets him go. The following day, Joe spots Ratso and angrily shakes him down. Ratso offers to share the apartment in which he is squatting in a condemned building. Joe accepts reluctantly, and they begin a \"business relationship\" as hustlers. As they develop a bond, Ratso's health, which has never been good, grows steadily worse.Joe's story is told through flashbacks. His grandmother raises him after his mother abandons him, and his grandmother abuses him. He also has a tragic relationship with Annie, a local girl. Ratso's backstory comes through stories he tells Joe. His father was an illiterate Italian immigrant shoe-shiner, who worked in a subway station. He developed a bad back, and \"coughed his lungs out from breathin' in that wax all day\". Ratso learned shining from his father but won't stoop so low as to do so. He dreams of moving one day to Miami.An unusual couple approach Joe and Ratso in a diner and hand Joe a flyer, inviting him to a party. They enter a Warhol-esque party scene (with Warhol superstars in cameos). Joe smokes a joint, thinking it's a normal cigarette and, after taking a pill someone offered, begins to hallucinate. He leaves the party with a socialite (Brenda Vaccaro), who agrees to pay $20 for spending the night with him, but Joe cannot perform. They play scribbage together and Joe shows his limited academic prowess. She teasingly suggests that Joe may be gay and he is suddenly able to perform.In the morning, the socialite sets up her friend as Joe's next customer and it appears that his career is on its way. When Joe returns home, Ratso is bedridden and feverish. Ratso refuses medical help and begs Joe to put him on a bus to Florida. Desperate, Joe picks up a man in an amusement arcade (Barnard Hughes), and when things go wrong, robs the man when he tries to pay with a religious medallion instead of cash. With the stolen money, Joe buys bus tickets. On the journey, Ratso's frail physical condition further deteriorates. At a rest stop, Joe buys new clothing for Ratso and himself, discarding his cowboy outfit. As they near Miami, Joe talks of getting a regular job, only to realize Ratso has died. The driver tells Joe there is nothing else to do but continue on to Miami.

He converces schizophrenically with himself via tape recordings of his own voice. He is also being hounded by Randy (Al Cliver), a shady loan shark whom he owes money to after accruing bad gambling debts.Lester picks up a certain Maggie MacDonald (Sasha Darwin), an obnoxious, hysterical, mustached, sexually frustrated alcoholic, whom he invites over at his house for dinner. His attempt to poison her is thwarted because she is already so drunk when she arrives at his place that she spills her glass of wine onto the floor. On the next attempt, she giddily mixed up his glass of wine with hers. He finally loses patience on the third try when she swallows the poisoned glassful, only to vomit before it can take effect. As Maggie excuses herself to the bathroom to clean up, he attacks her with a wooden stick. Her scalp splits apart and she runs screaming from the bathroom with blood streaming down her face. He chases her down the corridor bashing her head repeatedly, causing skin to rip away from her face, and a single bloodshot eyeball to roll out of her right eye socket onto the floor. Playing dead for a few seconds, Maggie rises when Parson's back is turned and makes another mad dash for the front door, but is rounded up and punched unconscious. Furious and exhausted, the killer shoves her head into an oven and switches it on, leaving her slumped with her flesh slowly melting off her face. Dead at last, Parson shoves Maggie's body into the trunk of his Mercedes. But he has to chop off the corpse's feet to get the body to fit right.When Parson ditches the body at a construction site, he is observed by a local tramp (Marco Di Stefano), who proceeds to attempt to blackmail Parson. Not to be deterred, he follows the derelict as he leaves. Catching up with him on a long stretch of country road, Parson puts his foot on the gas peddle and pursues the terrified man, eventually crunching the vehicle under him. The cars wheels roll backwards over the mangled body. The next day, when Parson sees on the TV that the tramp survived long enough to give the police a description of his attacker. Parson decides to change his image by shaving off his beard and wearing contact lenses in place of his eyeglasses.Parsons next victim is Alice Shogun (Ria De Simone), another crazed middle-aged woman who sings opera during sex. The weary killer strangles her to death with one of her stockings. Placing the body in the front seat of his car, Parson drives away, only to get pulled over by a motorcycle policeman and gets a speeding ticket. But the policeman does not notice that the woman with Parson is dead.Taking Alice's jewelry with him, he tries pawning it only to discover that is all fake. He tries to meet a horse fixer at a local racing stables for a tip about putting a bet on a horse, but the person never shows up. When more TV announcements give further descriptions of the mysterious killer, Parson is forced to chance his image again by dying the color of his black hair into brown, and wearing horn-rimmed, tinted eyeglasses.Sitting morosely at home, Parson responds to an unlikely invitation to \"come on over\" from Virginia (Zora Ulla Kesler), a similarly bored, lonely, wealthy, but far younger woman than his previous victims, when she dials his phone number by accident. However, the otherwise desirable Virginia is revealed to have a large and unattractive blemish on her upper lip. Even though she seems eager for intimacy, he is repulsed by her ugly scar. After Parson rings up another bad gambling debt to Randy, he decides to kill Virginia to steal whatever money and jewelry she has on her and flee the country.The following evening, Parson meets Virginia in her apartment suite for dinner. When he is about to kill her, she shoots him the chest after discovering the truth about him after seeing another TV broadcast of the latest description of the mysterious lady killer.

He is an earnest employee liked by his colleagues and is secretly in love and secretly even wanted to marry with Seo Yoon-hee (Son Ye-jin), a restaurant manager.The owner of the complex, Mr. Jo decides to hold a \"White Christmas\" party for tenants and VIPs on Christmas Eve, with helicopters circling above with huge lights attached below them, sprinkling snow onto the party. Dae-ho has promised to spend the day at an amusement park with his daughter Ha-na, but has to cancel when he is needed at the party. However, the building has faulty water sprinklers due to frozen pipes, but Mr. Cha, the Tower Sky's safety section head, is more concerned for the party than any possible architectural errors within the building, despite warnings from his fellow employers about these errors.One example of their warnings is when cook Young-cheol (Jeon Bae-soo) accidentally leaves a stove on for too long and causes a minor fire. Young-cheo is in love with a receptionist within the building named Min-jung, and even sneaks out of the kitchen while on duty to make her an ice cream.Meanwhile, Lee Seon-woo (Do Ji-han) is a rookie fireman entering the Yeouido Fire Station. When he gets accepted, he learns that many of the firefighters get more breaks than actual firefighting. In a prank to fool Seon-woo, the other firefighters ring the fire alarm for the squad to assemble while he takes a shower, causing him to appear in front of his entire team naked, much to the other firefighters' and even his own pleasure as they put his helmet on him for the first time.That evening, while the party is in full swing, and while Young-cheo proposes a rose to Min-jung in an elevator, huge gusts of wind cause one of the helicopters to lose control and the attached lights crash into the glass bridge connecting the two Tower Sky buildings and into a side of one of the buildings. Another one of the helicopters then crashes into the building, causing the helicopter to leak fuel and the building catches fire. Shards of glass fall onto the partygoers below, which include Mr. Yoon (Song Jae-ho) and his friend Mrs. Jung (Lee Joo-shil), while another one of the huge lights falls and crashes onto a bus on the street.At one point, while evacuating, some people, including a cowardly security guard, board an elevator despite warnings not to use it, as the security guard rejects Yoon-hee and Ha-na from entering just as they are about to board. While traveling down, an explosion occurs below the elevator, which stops it in its path. This literally fries the people inside while melting their shoes until the elevator explodes, killing everyone in it.Dae-ho moves quickly to save Ha-na, Yoon-hee and his colleagues as they try to find a way to escape. At the same time, firefighters, led by Captain Kang Young-ki (Sol Kyung-gu), as well as Seon-woo, arrive to fight to bring the blaze under control, helping Dae-ho in the process. Together they fight to save the lives of everyone.While Yoon-hee, Ha-na, Young-cheol, Ming-jung and the others take refuge in the building's Chinese restaurant, the firefighters decide to contain the blaze at its origin: the 63rd floor, where the helicopter crashed. Despite containing the fire on that floor, it spreads further within the building.Just when all seems hopeless, Young-ki sacrifices his own life to save not only Seon-woo, but for all people in the future, as he detonates a bomb to demolish the building, in order to prevent it from being damaged any further.", "output": "Question: In what district is the Tower Sky complex?, Answer: Yeouido., Question: How does Young-ki demolish the building?, Answer: Detonates a bomb., Question: Who is the owner of the complex?, Answer: Mr. Jo., Question: What ignites to start the fire?, Answer: Helicopter fuel., Question: Who is Lee Dae-ho (Kim Sang-kyung) in love with?, Answer: Seo Yoon-hee (Son Ye-jin), Question: Where does Lee Seon-woo (Do Ji-han)?, Answer: Yeouido Fire Station, Question: Who decides to hold a White Christmas\" party?, Answer: Mr. Jo, Question: Why are helicopters circling the tower?, Answer: To sprinkle snow., Question: Who is Young-cheol (Jeon Bae-soo) in love with?, Answer: Min-jung, Question: What is the condition of the tower's sprinkler system??, Answer: Faulty due to frozen water.", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

The person whom he is shown thus teaching is one Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn), a young woman with a horrendous Cockney accent who is selling flowers on the street. After overhearing this, Eliza finds her way to the professor's house and offers to pay for speech lessons, so that she can work in a flower shop. Pickering is intrigued and wagers that Higgins cannot back up his claim; Higgins takes Eliza on free of charge as a challenge to his skills.Eliza's father, Alfred P. Doolittle (Stanley Holloway), a dustman, arrives three days later, ostensibly to protect his daughter's virtue, but in reality simply to extract some money from Higgins, and is bought off with \u00a35. Higgins is impressed by the man's genuineness, natural gift for language and especially his brazen lack of morals (Doolittle explains, \"Can't afford 'em!\").Eliza goes through many forms of speech training, such as speaking with marbles in her mouth and trying to recite the sentence \"In Hertford, Hereford, Hampshire, hurricanes hardly ever happen\" without dropping the 'h', and to say \"The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain\" rather than \"The rine in spine sties minely in the pline\". At first, she makes no progress (due to Higgins's harsh approach to teaching), but just as she, Higgins, and Pickering are exhausted and about to give up, Higgins softens his attitude and gives an eloquent speech about the beauty and history behind the English language. Eliza tries one more time and finally \"gets it\"; she instantly begins to speak with an impeccable upper class accent.Higgins takes her on her first public appearance to Ascot Racecourse, where she makes a good impression with her stilted, but genteel manners, only to shock everyone by a sudden and vulgar lapse into Cockney; \"C'mon Dover, move your bloomin' arse!\". Higgins, who dislikes the pretentiousness of the upper class, partly conceals a grin behind his hand, as if to say \"I wish I had said that!\"The bet is won when Eliza successfully poses as a mysterious lady of patently noble rank at an embassy ball, despite the unexpected presence of a Hungarian phonetics expert trained by Higgins. Higgins's callous treatment of Eliza afterwards, especially his indifference to her future prospects, leads her to walk out on him, leaving him mystified by her ingratitude. When she is gone however, he comes to the horrified realization that he has \"grown accustomed to her face.\" Putting aside his resentment about the intrusion on his life and toward women in general, Higgins finds Eliza the next day and attempts to talk her into coming back to him. During a testy exchange, Higgins's ego gets the better of him, and his former student rejects him.Higgins makes his way home, stubbornly predicting that Eliza will be ruined without him and come crawling back. However, his bravado collapses and he is reduced to playing old phonograph recordings of her voice lessons.

They plan to prove Gloria's theory that cannibalism is a myth. The trio encounter Mike and his partner Joe. Joe is badly wounded; Mike explains that they were attacked by cannibals. During the night, Gloria goes missing and Rudy finds a native village while looking for her.Due to Joe's injuries, the travelers decide to stay in the nearly deserted village. Mike seduces the naive Pat. In a cocaine-fueled rage, he encourages Pat to kill a native girl. She is unable to do it, so Mike kills the girl himself. In his dying moments, Joe reveals that he and Mike were responsible for the cannibals' aggression. They came to the region to exploit the natives for emeralds and cocaine, taking advantage of their trust in white men. One day, while high on cocaine, Mike brutally tortured and killed their native guide in full view of the tribe. A badly charred body, previously believed to be that of a different guide, is actually this native. Mike kidnapped a native girl to lead them out of the jungle, but the outsiders were followed and attacked.Following the latest murder, the natives hunt the outsiders. Joe dies of his wounds, and his body is found and cannibalized by the natives in full view of Rudy and Gloria, who are hiding from the natives. Mike and Pat abandon the others, but all are captured by the natives and forced into a cage. The prisoners are forced to watch Mike as he is tortured and beaten. The natives transport their prisoners to another village, but Rudy manages to escape. He is caught in a booby trap in the jungle, and his bleeding wounds attract piranhas. The natives shoot him with a poisoned dart, and he dies instantly.Pat and Gloria are put in a hole in the ground. Mike is placed in a separate cage. A native man, whom Pat had saved from Mike's aggression, lowers a rope into the hole so the women can escape. Mike digs his way out of the cage, chases the man away and cuts the rope, preventing the women from escaping. Mike flees into the jungle, where he tries to attract the attention of a search and rescue plane, but he is recaptured. The natives sever one of his hands and drag him back to the village. The search plane lands, but the natives tell the rescuers that the outsiders' canoe capsized in the river and they were eaten by crocodiles.After the search team leaves, Pat is bound and stripped and the natives run hooks through her breasts. Gloria is forced to watch as she slowly bleeds to death. Mike's head is locked in a crude apparatus and the top of his skull is removed so that the natives can eat his living brain. During the night, the sympathetic native returns and frees Gloria. He guides her through the jungle, but falls victim to one of the natives' booby traps. Gloria eventually encounters a pair of trappers, who take her to safety. Instead of telling the true story, she recounts the natives' lie about the others being eaten by crocodiles.Gloria, deeply disturbed by her experiences, returns to civilization.

Kobayashi's plane malfunctions and is forced to land near Iwato Island, an uninhabited strip of rocks formed by volcanic eruptions. Tsukioka then looks for Kobayashi and finds him safe, with only a wrist sprain. While talking, the two men hear some strange sounds and find two monsters fighting. Tsukioka immediately recognizes one of the monsters to be Godzilla. The two monsters then fall off a cliff, into the ocean.Tsukioka and Kobayashi report to the authorities in Osaka, and find out that the other monster Godzilla was fighting is Anguirus. A group of scientists with the two pilots research Anguirus in a book written by a Polish scientist. Godzilla and Anguirus lived around the same time millions of years ago, and there was an intense rivalry between the two monsters.Archaeologist Kyohei Yamane, who experienced Godzilla's attack in 1954, is also present at the meeting, and shows a film (composed of clips from the 1954 film) of the original Godzilla attacking Tokyo. He confirms that this Godzilla is a second member of the same species, and that it and Anguirus were probably brought back to life by the same hydrogen bomb tests that awoke the original Godzilla. Yamane states that there is no way to kill Godzilla, and that Daisuke Serizawa, the inventor of the Oxygen Destroyer, had died and burned the formula. Yamane, though, suggests that the military should use flares on Godzilla to attract the monster away from the shore as Godzilla becomes angry when it sees lights because the hydrogen bomb's bright explosion had awakened and mutated it.Godzilla arrives on the shore of Osaka. While a blackout of all city lights is enforced, JASDF jets are sent to shoot flares from their planes to lead Godzilla away from the shore. Godzilla sees the flames, and, as Yamane predicted, starts to leave.Meanwhile, a prison truck transports dangerous criminals to another part of the country. All of the criminals, using body language, convey to each other that the cover of darkness caused by the city's blackout provides a great opportunity to escape from prison. The prisoners beat up the two policemen guarding them inside the truck, and run away. A few of them find a gasoline truck, and use it to escape. The truck crashes into an industrial building and starts a massive fire.The fire, much brighter than the planes' flares, attracts Godzilla back to the shore of Osaka. A few minutes later, Anguirus swims to shore and attacks Godzilla. The two creatures fight an intense battle, while destroying several buildings, including the tuna cannery that Tsukioka and Kobayashi work for. In the course of the battle, the criminals are drowned in the subway when it is flooded by the thrashing of the two monsters. Godzilla finally bites Anguirus's neck, and throws it upside down into a moat near Osaka Castle. Godzilla then fires its atomic ray at Anguirus, burning it to death in the ruins of the famed castle.Kobayashi is transferred to a Hokkaido plant. During a company party, Tsukioka and Hidemi, who came to visit, and Kobayashi are notified that Godzilla destroyed one of the company fishing boats. The military and Tsukioka begin a massive search for Godzilla. Tsukioka spots Godzilla swimming to the shore of a small, icy island. He notifies the cannery, and Kobayashi takes off in his plane to switch shifts with Tsukioka.Kobayashi dives his plane towards Godzilla to distract it from walking back into the ocean. Tsukioka, who has transferred to the air force, travels on a jet with an old friend. They drop bombs on Godzilla but are unsuccessful. Godzilla then wades towards shore. Kobayashi dives towards Godzilla again but Godzilla fires its atomic ray on Kobayashi's plane. The plane then crashes on an icy mountain, killing Kobayashi.Tsukioka is devastated but realizes that the military can shoot missiles at the mountain, and bury Godzilla in an avalanche, thereby freezing it to death. The jets fire their missiles, and bury Godzilla in snow and ice up to its midsection.The jets return to base to reload, and Tsukioka is authorized to fly in his own jet. The jets return to the icy island, only to find that Godzilla is digging its way out of the previous avalanche. They fire a fresh round of missiles at the mountain, triggering a new avalanche, burying Godzilla up to its neck. Tsukioka then fires his own missiles, burying Godzilla completely, thereby finishing the job. The men return home and receive the homage of a grateful nation, and Tsukioka and the woman he loves are at last able to go forward with their lives in peace.", "output": "Question: Who drops bombs on Godzilla ?, Answer: Tsukioka with an old friend., Question: Which archaeologist experienced Godzilla's attack in 1954?, Answer: Kyohei Yamane, Question: What are the names of the two Pilots ?, Answer: Shoichi Tsukioka and Koji Kobayashi., Question: Who is Godzilla's rival?, Answer: Anguirus, Question: Who was able to bury Godzilla completely?, Answer: Tsukioka, Question: Where does Kobayashi dive his plane towards ?, Answer: Godzilla., Question: What awakened and mutated Godzilla?, Answer: Hydrogen bomb's bright explosion, Question: What do the JASDF jets shoot at Godzilla?, Answer: Flares., Question: Who report to the authorities in Osaka?, Answer: Tsukioka and Kobayashi, Question: What happens during a company party ?, Answer: Godzilla destroys one of the company fishing boats., Question: Which town was attacked by Godzilla in 1954?, Answer: Tokyo, Question: What attracted Godzilla back to Osaka?, Answer: The fire, Question: Who beat up the two policemen?, Answer: the prisoners, Question: Where is Kobayashi transferred to ?, Answer: Hokkaido plant., Question: How does the military hope to kill Godzilla?, Answer: Freezing it to death, Question: Who is hunting for schools of fish ?, Answer: Two pilots., Question: Where are the criminals drowned?, Answer: the subway, Question: Where was Godzilla digging out of?, Answer: The avalanche, Question: Who attacks Godzilla on shore?, Answer: Anguirus, Question: Why did the jets return to base?, Answer: They needed to reload, Question: What transports dangerous criminals?, Answer: a prison truck", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Their parents give their support to the union, but Veer suddenly starts getting visions of events that he can't remember ever happening to him &amp; finds that he is an expert in fighting techniques no pehelwaan, including his father, have ever seen before. Nobody has any explanation for these facts. one day, as the Chief Minister (Anjan Srivastav) is giving a speech at a certain function in his village, Veer suddenly spots a sniper trying to aim at the CM. Veer lunges to save the CM, only to find that the sniper and the building are both missing. Veer grows restless, but nobody notices that the CM has grown restless on seeing Veer. Some days later, at Veer's wedding, some goons attack the party and try to kill Veer. Veer kills them single-handedly. Convinced that everyone is hiding something important from him, he demands answers. The Thakur relents and tells him that he is neither Veer nor their son.The real Veer (Arbaaz Khan) was a soldier who died in the line of duty. After immersing his ashes, he found the bullet-ridden body of an unknown man. When he realized that this man had no memories of his past, he told him that he is Veer &amp; concoct a past for him, because they feel the need to have a son. Veer decides to go on a quest to find his real identity. He goes to Mumbai to find that both police and goons are baying for his blood. He meets a teenager who calls him Ali bhaiyya (brother), but the teenager dies while trying to save Ali from an assassin. The hero does not see the face of the assassin, but assumes that his name is Ali. He gets visions of a girl (Sushmita Sen) whom he has never seen.The mystery starts unwinding when he meets a guy named Inder (Inder Kumar). As Ali starts getting his past memories, it is confirmed that his name is indeed Ali. Ali &amp; the teenager were orphaned brothers, while Inder was Ali's friend. An old man named Rahim Chacha (Alok Nath) was their guardian. The mysterious girl Ali saw was Mehak, his love. Ali and Inder had won medals for shooting during many contests, although Ali was always the better. The marksmanship skills is noticed by the Joint Commissioner of Mumbai Crime Branch, Arvind Raj (Mukesh Rishi), who makes a proposal to them: masquerade as goons of a gang, kill goons of their rival gang &amp; trick both the gangs to destroy each other in gang wars. Ali refuses flatly, but after some goons kill Rahim Chacha, Ali &amp; Inder decide to take the offer.Mehak gives both the guys portable video recorders, so that they can prove their innocence if anything goes wrong. Soon, the Inspector takes them to the Chief Minister (Sadashiv Amrapurkar) &amp; his aide (Anjan Srivastav). They plan to enact an attack on the CM, making the opposition look dirty in eyes of people &amp; garnering sympathy votes for CM. However, when Ali is trying to fake the shooting, somebody really kills the CM. The police start chasing Ali, thinking him to be the killer &amp; Ali flees.After recovering his memory, Ali realizes that the CM's aide took advantage of the plan to become CM himself. Meanwhile, Ali learns that Inder made Mehak his fiancee to save her from harassment. Ali tries to tell the truth to the Inspector, but realizes that nobody believes him. In an attack when Ali goes aboard a local, the remaining memories come to him. He remembers boarding the train same way on the day of assassination where Inder met him &amp; confessed to killing the CM. Thereafter, Inder shot Ali to hide the truth &amp; threw his body in a river. Suddenly, the Inspector confronts him, Ali convinces the Inspector by telling the truth.Ali goes to Mehak &amp; tells her everything.

Inder and Ali has a hand-to-hand fight. Ali demands Inder an explanation for his actions.Inder reveals that he was always second best with Ali around &amp; that even Mehak, whom he secretly loved, chose Ali over him. Also, Ali always got money &amp; fame more easily than Inder. Inder reveals that he had sent the goons to kill Rahim Chacha, thus manipulating Ali to take the offer. Also, when Ali came back to Bombay, Inder saw him. Inder was the sniper whom Ali's brother saw.Ali kills Inder in combat and afterwards broadcasts Inder's tape over the cable TV network, thus freeing himself from his charges &amp; putting the present CM in the dock.

We are then bought to a house party. Jake (Alec) proposes a toast to his friends' anniversary (Ted & Ally). The four talk momentarily about their son's graduation, and then Alec's young wife (he divorced Jane, played by Meryl Streep, 10 years ago) walks towards them. Jane seemed shock the way Agness approaches the group and the lack of clothing she had on. Jane leaves as Agness walk towards Jake; they exchange a few words of meeting up in New York at a hotel. Jane and Ally, to much dismay talked about Jane's divorce as they walk towards the door and how Ally didn't seem to feel comfortable around the sight of Agness. As Jane closes the gate, Jake turns around just in time to take a glimpse of Jane, letting us know that he still has feelings for her, although they've been divorced ten years.We then follow up to Jane's middle child, Gabby (Zoe Kazan) who is moving out of the house. The oldest daughter, Lauren (Caitlin Fitzgerald), and her fiancee Harley (John Krasinski) assist Gabby as Jane arrives home. Although reluctant to let Gabby move out of the house, she agrees. Lauren teases her mother, saying she must be lonely and afraid to sleep alone. Jane denies that, saying \"One of you is always moving out\". Harley: \"They just grow up so freaking fast.\" Lauren: \"Mom, you should get a dog.\" The couple leaves and Jane walks into her kitchen, and reminisces about the many memories with all her children at home with her, now all grown up.The following day, at her bakery, Jane's friend Peter brings along another architect (Steve Martin) to show blueprints to remodel parts of her house. They talk briefly before she remembers she has an appointment with a doctor. As she leaves the office, the elevator stops on the Fertility Center floor and Jake walks in.That night, Jane and her friends enjoy laughs over dinner. They recommend Jane should find a date, rather be semi-miserable at home. The next day, at New York, Jane's family all meet up with Luke, the youngest son, one last night before graduation. They book a hotel (mentioned earlier at the house party). The kids leave to a party, leaving Jane in the hotel. Again, Jane gets in an elevator, this time with a random couple hugging and kissing. She decides to go to the bar and grab a drink. Coincidentally, Jake is there and they talk. He tells her that he is \"flying it low\" because Pedro has a stomach flu, so he is free for the night. Jane asks when was the last time they were together, he says 1999. Next thing they're having a good time on the dance floor and they go back to the hotel room. They do their thing and Jane felt horrible; drunk and half realizing she had just slept with her ex-husband. Jake says \"This is amazing, we just had a great time\" as Jane is leaning on the toilet, throwing up and regretting it. During the graduation, the whole family is together and the kids were excited to see their father Jake, despite the divorce. At lunch, the family is having dinner and Jake flirts with Jane, and proposes a toast to Jane, however the family thought it was suppose to be to Luke's academic success. They take it and drink. Gabby properly finishes the toast to Luke.Adam (Steve Martin) drives his Audi to Jane's house to talk about the project of modeling her home. In his car, he is listening to a CD, lecturing on divorces. He sees Jane jogging, calls her and she apologizes for almost forgetting the appointment. She gets in the car and hears the audio and Adam, embarrassingly tries to turn it off. As he finishes talking about the blueprint, Jake arrives in his Porsche. They introduce each other and Adam leaves. Jake goes inside for \"coffee\", which actually turns out to be more flirting and another sex affair. Once again, Jake is happy and Jane is dismayed for being a \"mistress\" (all in a fun, comedic way). He claims fate brought them together again and that he is a walking clich\u00e9, father to a kid in kindergarten, but they're all grown up. That night, Jane's three closest friends talk over wine. They all notice Jane is acting differently, more energetic. She tells them she's been having sex and having an affair with Agness's husband, Jake. The four ladies all get excited and accepted the fact that Jane is having an affair with Jake. They all hate Agness, and one observes \"Karma is a b-tch\").Her energetic passion moves along to the bakery. She tells her bakers to make the breakfast menu more lively. SHe then receives a phone call from Adam, whose waiting at her house for another appointment. He set up a chunk of land with different color tapes and a ladder acting as stairs to the second floor. All this is just a preview of how Adam is going to fix the house. She receives a call from Jake, but doesn't answer it. That night at Jake's house, we see him leaving a message for Jane to pick up her phone. He is in the bathroom with the water running, to prevent Agness from hearing. Pedro, being a nosy brat, asks Jake why he was \"showering\" with his clothes on. Agness comes in and Pedro snitches, but Jake leaves without getting caught. He drives over to Jane's house. Meanwhile, Adam is having dinner at her house. They talk and Jake spies on them through the kitchen window, then accidentally falls. As Adam leaves, Jake knocks on the door and says, \"Oh Em Gee <omg>, I thought he'd never leave.\" He grabs her and flirts. Jane says \"it's Nine o'clock, shouldn't your wife be concern?\" He reaches for her delicious dish and goes to the bathroom. He is sitting next to the bathtub eating her lavender ice cream, while she baths. He takes out marijuana and asks if she remembers the old days, when they would smoke and get high. But that night, Jane tells Jake she has changed, but he insists and puts the marijuana in the sink's cabinet, saying one day they will smoke it together for old times sake.The next morning, Jane meets her psychiatrist, Dr. Alan. She asks if an affair is okay. He sees her condition of affair as a good way to reconnecting with Jake, so suggests she continues. That night she arranges a candle-lit dinner in hopes of being back with Jake as a family, which Jake agrees happily over the phone. He was at the fertility center when she called. They meet up in the same hotel the same afternoon, to Harley's surprise while having lunch with Lauren. He kisses her, trying to distract her from noticing Jane and Jake getting into the elevator and kissing as the doors close. In the room, Jake faints and a doctor goes up as Harley sees this as well. Jake tells the doctor he is taking \"Flomax\" to reduce constant urination. In return, it decreases his semen. (He tells the doctor due to to his decrease in semen, it isn't good for his wife, which Jane thinks is the reason for the fertility center, but actually Jake was saying it to her. Both the doctor and Jane were surprised, but Jane agrees to follow the story and says she prefers lots of semen, all in which the doctor said \"wow\" as if it was a competitive matter to please a women.)That night, Jane prepares the special dinner for Jake, making his favorite dishes and picking a nice dress. Jake at home, anxious to leave the house, grabs his phone and walks to the bathroom. Agness notices the phone and grows suspicious, preventing him from calling Jane. She tells him to put Pedro back in his bed, and takes off her shirt, saying she is ovulating, compensating the dinner arrangement which Jake had thought was able to attend, since Agness was going to a party, but canceled due to ovulation.Jane drinks a glass wine walking around with the food getting cold and she waits for Jake, unknowingly of the situation. Jake seemed distressed as he sets Pedro in his bed and puts his hand on the boy's chest. At this moment, Jake feels torn apart from two different families. He goes over to Jane's house the next morning, hoping for forgiveness, but Jane ignores him as if he wasn't there. The kids are happy to see him and ask if Jane will be coming to the party with dad. She says \"No, I have another date with Adam.\" to much of Jake's surprise, so he leaves the house since he couldnt stay over because of Agness.Adam and Jane's relationship grows stronger. They have dinner together and one night, she takes him to her bakery to make croissants. They flirt and eventually Adam was going to ask if he could kiss her, but she already kissed him. Afterwards, Adam drives her to Luke's party and before they arrive, Jane takes the marijuana that was supposedly meant for Jake and her to smoke, decided to smoke it with Adam. He was hesitant at first, but let in. Luke's friend walks by and asks, \"Who brought the reefer?\", unknowingly Jane and Adam were smoking behind the shrubs. They go inside and dance/laugh. Adam sees Jake at a table, glaring at him with Jane, enviously. He walks over and asks if he can talk with Jane for a second. Jake takes her to the bathroom and confess his love for her. He realizes she was high and she admittedly said she smoked the reefer with Adam instead. Jake gets annoyed because it was meant for him and Jane, but he takes it from her just as Harley opens the door and sees them together, again this time, but smoking the reefer. Harley was going to leave them two alone, but Jane intervened and asks him to take a pull, which at first he didn't want to, but took a big pull. The three walk out and Adam is dancing with Agness, and Jake dances with Jane, which Agness sees and gets emotional and a bit upset, now that the secrets revealed. She sees Jake happily dance and smile affectionately at Jane. Jake was just about to kiss Jane, but she turns away and tells him that it's over and stop this affair immediately. She walks towards Adam. Jake sees Jane smile happily as she approaches Steve and feels sad, as Agness is across the room staring at him, which he doesn't notice.The following morning, everybody is drunk. Harley is wearing female pajamas, Luke forgot what happened last night. Gabby yawns, just as she asks, \"What is dad doing outside?\" Jane walks out and Jake approaches her. He told her that he left Agness that night, for good. He really loves Jane and wants to live here again, since he has no where to go. The kids come out to see whats going on and sees the truth that although the parents are divorced, Jake wants to be back again. Luke wants Dad to stay for the night, which Jane didnt allow but the kids really want dad back home so she allows him to stay. That night, Jake is at the dinner table devouring the delicious food Jane made. The kids stare at him with smiles. Jane however, isnt at the dinner table, but upstairs video-chatting with Adam over the computer. Jake decides to run upstairs, as she's in the bathroom. He takes his clothes off and lays on the bed. The computer is on the bed, which Jake doesnt realize Adam is watching. But both Adam and Jane went to the bathroom, so Jake adjusts the computer as Jane walks out and screams, Adam comes back and sees Jake's private area and yells all different kinds of things. Jake surprised gets off the bed and turns around to pick up his clothes, only to moon at the computer (Adam). The kids run to the room and asks whats going on. Jake confesses that he left Agness for their mother. They have been meeting secretly since New York, and having an affair. The kids, shocked asks Jane if this is correct, which she agrees to. Gabby asks if they're going to be back together, which Jake says yes they will, but Jane strictly says, \"No, we're not going to be together again.\" Adam hears this and immediately turns off this computer, which Jane sees. The kids, all upset and emotional deprived, leaves the house. Jake, astonished and rejected packs his bags and drives off. That night Jane sleeps outside the pool area, staring at the full moon, realizing the mess she has gotten into- an affair with Jake and a growing relationship with Adam, it's complicated.The following morning, Jane arrives at Adam's office and apologizes. Adam tells her that her divorce isn't officially over. He sees the love that Jake is expressing towards her is real. He continues to say that, it's best if he discontinues to meet with Jane, incase of getting into a serious relationship. He wants to resolve this situation simply by leaving her and allowing her divorce with Jake to heal. Jane asks if he will continue with remodeling her kitchen, but he says he might let Peter fill in the job instead. She becomes speechless and walks out. She drives home and sees Jake sitting on a swing outside her house. She sits down with him and they talk. Jake says he loves her and doesn't regret a second chance. Jane smiles and says the same. It starts to rain, but we just see the rain hitting the swing they were sitting on. The camera then focuses on a group of men outside, huddle under a tent discussing the project. Jane walks outside in hopes of seeing Adam, but doesn't. However, he pops out from the crowd and tells her, \"Its a lucky day to construct in the rain.\" She smiles and asks the group if they want coffee. They all walk inside the house as Adam walks with her and asks if she has any of those double fudge chocolate cakes in her house. She laughs, saying \"You love that stuff, don't you?\" The credits roll.", "output": "Question: In which city did Luke attend college?, Answer: New York, Question: What is the name of Jane and Jake's son?, Answer: Pedro, Question: Who plays Harley?, Answer: John krasinski, Question: Who had a divorce?, Answer: Jane and Jake, Question: who is cheating on jane?, Answer: Jake, Question: How many childrens have jane?, Answer: four, Question: What do Jane and Jake make at the bakery?, Answer: santa barbara, Question: Adam falls in love with whom?, Answer: Jane, Question: what is the name of jane' son?, Answer: Luke, Question: who is jane?, Answer: Jake's ex wife, Question: how many daughters have jane?, Answer: Two, Question: What is Jane's profession?, Answer: bakery in Santa Barbara, California, Question: who is architech?, Answer: Adam played by Steve Martin, Question: which places have jane's bakery?, Answer: <No Answer>", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

A stranger, Dr. Harry Blair (Brian Aherne), calls and confides to the bridegroom some information about his bride's past. Flashback level 1. Harry's account opensHarry, a psychiatrist, meets and marries Nancy in 1938. One day a stranger, Norman Clyde (Robert Mitchum), comes to his office and asks him to persuade Nancy to go to the District Attorney and give evidence to reprieve an innocent man due to be executed within 24 hours. He explains why. Flashback level 2. Norman's account opensNorman, an artist, first meets Nancy 3 years earlier. He wins an award partly through the influence of Nancy, who is secretary to Andrew Bonner (Ricardo Cortez), a patron of the arts. A romance starts between Norman and Nancy, until he finds in her handbag a bracelet which had been stolen from Bonner's house while they were guests there. He faces Nancy with her crime. She confesses, and tearfully confesses why she stole the bracelet. Flashback level 3. Nancy's account Ten year old Nancy (Sharyn Moffett) lives with her mother, Mrs Monks (Helene Thimig), who works as housekeeper to Mrs Willis (Katherine Emery). Nancy and Mrs Willis' daughter Karen (Gloria Donovan) are close friends, but Nancy is excluded from Karen's birthday party by social snobbery. In compensation Karen gives Nancy a locket which her mother has just given her. When she finds out, Mrs Willis takes it away from Nancy, whose mother seeks to comfort her by telling her that if she wants things badly enough, some day she will have them. The locket then goes missing. Mrs Willis assumes that Nancy has stolen it back, even when the locket is found entangled in the dress Karen had been wearing. Mrs Willis bullies Nancy into a confession that she stole the locket. Nancy is distressed, and knocks down a musical cigarette box, which starts to play Au Clair de la Lune. Return to flashback level 2. Norman's account closesNancy concludes her story and tells Norman that she has never stolen anything in her life before. Norman applies some amateur psychology, tells her that she carries no blame for the locket incident, and accepts her assurance that she will never steal again. They become engaged. One evening during a party at the Bonners he goes upstairs, suspecting that Nancy might be up there with Bonner. He hears a shot, and sees Nancy leaving Bonner's bedroom, in which Bonner lies dead. Nancy says that Bonner was dead when she entered the room. She persuades Norman that it would be best for them both to tell the police that they were downstairs all evening. Norman agrees. A footman, Myron Dexter (David Thursby), goes on trial for Bonner's murder. Nancy knows that the prosecution's version of events is not true, as she did not see Dexter upstairs when he was alleged to be, but against Norman's wishes she refuses to testify to that effect. When the footman is convicted, Norman and Nancy part company. Return to flashback level 1.

Harry does not believe Norman's story, but invites Norman to call on him that evening and confront Nancy face to face. Harry goes home and tells Nancy what has transpired. She laughs it off, and says that Norman believed wrongly that she was having an affair with Bonner, and is now mad with jealousy. When Norman arrives she acts with innocent sympathy for his delusions. Harry believes her, and Norman leaves.The following day Norman calls on Harry again at his office, and says that Dexter has been executed, but his conscience is clear, and it is now on Harry's conscience. Norman then leaps through the skyscraper window to his death.Harry and Nancy travel to England. When the war starts they undertake medical work during the blitz. Nancy obtains an invitation for them to spend a weekend at a country home of Lord and Lady Wyndham (Henry Stephenson and Lilian Fontaine). As they are leaving they are informed that Lady Wyndham's diamond necklace cannot be found. Harry says nothing, but is torn by suspicion that it is hidden in Nancy's handbag. When they get home Nancy tips her handbag out to find the door keys. There is no necklace there. Harry is mortified, and confesses to Nancy that he had harboured suspicions of her. Nancy takes no offence, and acts with complete innocence.That night their lodgings are bombed. Searching through the rubble Harry finds a box of jewellery, including the stolen necklace. He confronts Nancy with it, and she denies all knowledge. As he looks into her eyes, he realises that she is schizophrenic. The discovery unhinges him, and Nancy has him committed to a mental institution.Return to the present day (1946)Harry tells John that Nancy divorced him and assumed the name Patton. After five years he has now been released. He saw Nancy's photograph in a newspaper announcement of the wedding, and came immediately to apprise John of her past. John does not believe him, and sends for Nancy. She is not at all put out at the sight of Harry, and says that she once worked with him. She laughingly denies ever having married him. Harry makes no further attempt to convince John, but says \"I remember what Clyde said of me, He's going to make all the mistakes I did.\" After Harry has left, Nancy tells John that he cracked up as a result of the war. As Nancy prepares to walk down the aisle we see her future mother-in-law for the first time. It is the same Mrs Willis that her mother used to work for. Mrs Willis fastens a locket around Nancy's neck, the very locket that was the subject of the childhood incident. Mrs Willis tells Nancy that it is a family heirloom, worn by generations of Willis brides. Karen would have had it, but she has since died. \"I'm sure Karen would want you to have it,\" Mrs Willis says. Nancy accidentally knocks down the same musical cigarette box that she had those many years ago, and it begins to play Au Clair de la Lune. As she starts to walk slowly down the aisle, memories of her past acts begin to surface, and she becomes more and more distressed as realisation dawns of what she has done. She collapses, and is taken away in an ambulance, having regressed into childhood, perhaps never to recover.", "output": "Question: What was the bride-to-be accused of as a child?, Answer: Stealing a locket", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

However, Brooks lives a secret life as a serial killer, known as the \"Thumbprint Killer\". Brooks has abstained from murder for the past two years by attending twelve-step meetings for addicts, to try and cope with his \"killing addiction\". He feels the compulsion to kill rising again, however, as his id, Marshall (William Hurt), becomes more insistent. Brooks gives in to his addiction and kills a young couple while they are having sex in their house and, as part of his psychopathology, leaves each of the victims' bloody thumbprints on a lampshade. Brooks follows his meticulous modus operandi, including fastidious preparation, cleaning up the crime scene, even locking the doors before departing, and burning the clothes he was wearing during the killings. Marshall then realizes that the couple's curtains were open, facing an apartment building.Brooks' daughter Jane (Danielle Panabaker) unexpectedly arrives home, having dropped out of college in Palo Alto, California. She visits Brooks at work and mentions that she would like to get a job with his company. The same day, a man calling himself \"Mister Smith\" (Dane Cook) turns up at Brooks' work and blackmails him with photographs of Brooks at the most recent murder. Smith demands that Brooks take him along on a murder, to which Brooks reluctantly agrees.Brooks' wife, Emma (Marg Helgenberger), reveals that Jane dropped out of college because she is pregnant. The Brookses are then visited by detectives from Palo Alto who want to interview Jane about a murder committed in her former dorm building. Marshall and Brooks realize that Jane committed the murder and consider letting her go to jail to \"save her\" from becoming like them. Eventually, however, Brooks uses an alternate identity, flies to Palo Alto, and commits a similar murder to make it appear as if a serial killer is loose, thereby exonerating Jane.Brooks researches the background of the police officer chasing the Thumbprint Killer, Detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore), and discovers she's in the middle of an agonizing divorce from Jesse Vialo (Jason Lewis). Brooks decides that Vialo and his lawyer, Sheila (Reiko Aylesworth), will be Smith's first \"victims\". At the scene of the Vialo murder, Smith wets his pants in a fit of panic, leaving his DNA for the police to discover later.While driving away from the scene, Smith pulls a gun on Brooks, which Brooks and Marshall had predicted would happen. Brooks explains to Smith that he knows he can't stop killing, and so plans to commit suicide to spare his family the shame of his being caught. Brooks takes Smith to a cemetery he owns, and explains that they will find an open grave. Smith will shoot Brooks and then cover him with just enough dirt to mask the body. The next day, a casket will be lowered into the grave and covered, and Brooks' body will never be discovered.Smith attempts to shoot Brooks, but Brooks reveals that, at some point prior, he had broken into Smith's apartment and bent the firing pin on Smith's pistol, rendering it inoperable on the off-chance that Brooks would change his mind. Brooks' brush with death makes him realize he wants to live to see his grandchild, and he turns on his would-be murderer, slitting Smith's throat with a shovel and hiding his body in the open grave. With Smith's urine providing the only DNA evidence of the Thumbprint Killer at a murder scene, Brooks will remain undetected. Smith is named as the Thumbprint Killer and Brooks returns to his normal life.Knowing he is in the clear, Brooks calls Detective Atwood, whom he has come to admire, to ask her why she is a police officer. She replies that her wealthy father had wanted a boy, and she wanted to succeed in spite of him. Atwood is unable to trace the call before Brooks hangs up, but she is puzzled as she realises Smith was not the voice on the line and that they may have fingered the wrong guy.

Having grown up an orphan, Uxbal has no family other than his brother Tito, who works in the construction business. Uxbal earns a living by procuring work for illegal immigrants and managing a group of Chinese women producing forged designer goods along with the African street vendors who are selling them. He is able to talk to the dead and is sometimes paid to pass on messages from the recently deceased at wakes and funerals. When he is diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer leaving him with only a few months to live, his world progressively falls apart.Uxbal initially begins chemotherapy, but he later ends the treatment at the advice of his friend and traditional healer Bea. She also gives him two black stones which she asks him to give his children before he dies. The group of Africans are brutally arrested by the police despite Uxbal's regular bribes because of their involvement with drugs. When his friend Ekweme faces deportation to Senegal, Uxbal offers Ekweme's wife Ige and their baby son a room in his apartment. Meanwhile, an attempt at reconciliation with Marambra fails when Uxbal realizes she cannot be trusted to raise his children. Tito brokers a deal to put the Chinese to work at a construction site. However, almost all of them die while asleep in the basement of their sweatshop due to malfunctioning gas heaters installed by Uxbal. An attempt by a human trafficker to dump the bodies into the sea fails when they are washed up on the shore shortly after.As Uxbal's health continues to deteriorate, he is plagued with guilt that he is responsible for the death of the immigrants. As his death draws nearer, he realizes that there will be nobody to take care of Ana and Mateo once he is gone. He entrusts the remainder of his savings to Ige, asking her to stay with the children after his death. She accepts his request but later decides to use the money to pay for her return to Africa. She changes her mind at the last minute, however, and returns to the apartment. Knowing that Ige will take care of his children, Uxbal lies down next to Ana and dies after having passed on to her a diamond ring which his father had once given to his mother.

Beau is clearly smitten by her, and it is later revealed that the two have been having an affair, even though Kelly is married to James (McGraw). Kelly is checked out of rehab a month early by James, who wants her to go on a three-city tour to restore her image. She agrees on the condition that Beau becomes her opening act, but James has already made plans to see Chiles Stanton (Meester), a beauty queen with potential to become a rising singer, perform that night in hopes that she will be Kelly's opener instead.On the night of Chiles' performance, it is revealed that Beau has been acquainted with her before and doesn't want her on the tour, dismissing her as a \"Country Barbie\". Chiles' performance nearly falls apart as she gets stage fright and can't sing; however, Beau steps in and begins to sing \"Friends in Low Places\". The two sing the song together, and it gives Chiles the courage to continue on her own. James is impressed by Beau's performance, and offers the opening act to both Beau and Chiles. He suggests to Beau that he and Chiles could make quite the duo, but Beau disagrees. Nevertheless, Beau agrees to go on the tour because he cares so much about Kelly.The first show is a disaster: before going on, Kelly receives an anonymous package containing a bloody baby doll with a note reading \"Baby Killer,\" referring to the baby Kelly miscarried when she fell off the stage in Dallas during her last concert before she went into rehab. At that concert, she was five months pregnant and was found to have a blood alcohol level of 0.19 when she was in the hospital for the injuries related to the fall. Kelly falls apart, starts drinking, and almost refuses to go on. However, she is coerced into going on stage by James. She begins to sing \"Country Strong\" but breaks down on stage. She attempts to try another song, \"A Fighter\", but breaks down again and is led off stage by her husband, ending the show. They tell the media at a press conference that they had to cancel the show due to food poisoning and head off to the next show.Beau ends his relationship with Kelly, and begins to spend more time with Chiles, whose fame has been increasing as the tour progresses. Both Chiles and Beau form a bond and Beau lets go of his earlier hostilities towards her. She even finishes the chorus to his song \"Give in to Me\".Later, Beau confronts James about Kelly's worsening condition. James insists that Kelly may get better, and says that he can't let her go out with a failure. Beau disagrees and subtly admits their affair. Enraged, James punches him in the jaw and leaves the room.Before the next show in Austin, Kelly gets drunk and is unable to go on stage. Beau and Chiles still do their opening act, and it is then that they perform \"Give in to Me\" for the first time together. JJ, Kelly's agent, nearly cancels the tour but is dissuaded by Kelly's offer of sex. Beau witnesses this and becomes frustrated with Kelly. That same night, Chiles and Beau have sex, and Beau confesses to Chiles that he likes her.In Dallas, Beau gives Chiles a pair of star-shaped earrings she had said she always wanted and asks her to move with him to California. Chiles immediately says yes, but changes her mind and asks him for time to consider the offer.The two perform and Kelly comes out, this time sober and ready, and performs her entire set for the first time. Kelly is seen performing \"Country Strong\", \"Shake That Thing\", and \"Coming Home\". After the concert, James and JJ immediately begin making plans for Kelly's future. That night, Kelly commits suicide by overdosing on prescription medication. She leaves a letter to Beau, echoing his earlier words that \"Love and fame can't live in the same place.\" In the letter, she gives him the advice to choose \"love\". Beau takes her advice, and after Kelly's funeral, he moves to California.Later on, Beau is seen singing in a bar in California, and he sees Chiles walk in, wearing the earrings he gave her.

While she is developing the online romance between her mother and fake Ben, and preventing her mother and the real Ben from meeting in person, she finds herself drawn to a cute, artistic boy in her class, Adam (Ben Feldman), but is unwilling to get close to anyone due to her history of being uprooted and having to say goodbye so often.As the charade continues, and as Holly spends more time with Ben while picking his brain for romance tips, she slowly begins to see qualities in Ben which make her believe he is her mother's 'perfect man.' Unfortunately there is no way her mother can ever meet the real Ben without Holly's plan being exposed. Holly asks help from Adam to disguise as Ben in the telephone and break up with Jean. But he fails, as he is revealed to be harboring feelings for Holly as well, in effect telling Holly's mother the opposite of what is planned.Next day at school, Adam admits his feelings for Holly by kissing her. That night, Lenny (Mike O'Malley), a man who is infatuated with Jean, proposes to her and she replies with a 'maybe'. Holly, in an act of desperation, then disguises herself as Ben's secretary and arranges a meeting between Ben and her mom. Next day, when Holly mistakenly thinks Ben is marrying someone else, she disrupts the wedding to tell Ben he should be with her mother, not knowing he was there because the bride is his dear friend and he was catering the wedding. A disappointed Ben follows her out and she admits the full story. Holly then goes to the meeting place and admits the whole ruse to Jean, who seems to take it terribly. Days pass by and Holly and her mom maintain a cold relationship, and Holly is offended by her interpretation of Adam's drawing of \"Princess Holly.\" Holly begs Jean for them to move again. Her mother is humiliated and wants to stay, but Holly tells her to leave this once for Holly. She says that she always has to move for her mom. Her mom can't argue with that so they start to pack. Adam, for what he thinks is the last time, goes to Holly's home and gives Holly's mom his drawing, commenting that the drawing has another side, which turns out to be Adam telling Holly that he'll always be there for her.Touched, Jean logs onto the internet using Holly's screen name and talks to Adam. Adam, thinking it's Holly, says that her mom is setting a bad example, getting up and leaving when things get bad. Jean is deeply moved by this and decides to stay, finding a new job and trying to rebuild her life without running away. She also apologizes to her daughter and tells her to look at the other side of the drawing, making Holly happy.Meanwhile Ben is inspired by what Holly told him about her mother, and with Holly's help, Jean and Ben finally meet and Jean finds her 'perfect man' at last. Holly is on the road to her perfect man as well since she has some stability in her life and finally opens up and admits her feelings for Adam. At the end, Adam and Holly go to their first school dance together.", "output": "Question: What does Holly send to her mother?, Answer: Orchids and other gifts and love notes., Question: Whose screen name does Jean use to log onto the Internet?, Answer: Holly, Question: Who does Holly ask to help her with her plan?, Answer: Adam, Question: What was Ben catering?, Answer: A wedding, Question: What does Holly name the secret admirer?, Answer: Ben, Question: Who does Adam say is setting a bad example for Holly?, Answer: Jean, Question: Who give Holly romantic advice?, Answer: Ben, Question: Who does Adam admit his feelings to?, Answer: Holly, Question: Who does Holly fall for?, Answer: Adam, Question: Who is the real Ben?, Answer: Amy's uncle, Question: Who does Holly beg to move?, Answer: Jean, Question: What is the relationship between Jean and Holly?, Answer: mother and daughter, Question: Who orders flowers for a woman?, Answer: Amy's (Vanessa Lengies) uncle Ben, Question: Who does Lenny propose to?, Answer: Jean, Question: What does Holly pick Ben's brain for tips on?, Answer: Romance, Question: Whose secretary does Holly dress up as?, Answer: Ben's., Question: What does Adam tell Holly?, Answer: He'll always be there for her, Question: What inspires Ben?, Answer: Holly's story about her mother, Question: What is the name Jean's daughter?, Answer: Holly, Question: What happens at the end?, Answer: Adam and Holly go to their first school dance together, Question: Who does Holly disguise herself as?, Answer: Ben's secretary, Question: Who does Adam have feelings for?, Answer: Holly, Question: Who invents a secret admirer for Jean?, Answer: Holly", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

She attempts to bite Harker, but Dracula [Christopher Lee] intervenes. The next morning, Harker finds marks on his neck and knows he must act fast. He hides his diary at a crossroads, goes to the crypt, stakes the woman vampire, but Dracula wakes up. Days later Van Helsing [Peter Cushing] arrives at Klausenberg Inn; asking after Harker. The innkeeper's wife Inga [Barbara Archer] gives him Harker's dairy. Van Helsing goes to Dracula's castle where he sees a funeral coach leaving. He finds Harker lying in a coffin and stakes him.Weeks later, in Karlstadt, Van Helsing informs Arthur [Michael Gough] and Mina [Melissa Stribbing] Holmwood of Harker's death. Harker's fiancee, Lucy Holmwood [Carol Marsh], is ill and is being treated for anemia by Dr Seward [Charles Lloyd Pack]. When alone, Lucy opens her window and lets in Dracula. Mina seeks advice from Van Helsing who examines Lucy, sees marks on her neck, and instructs Mina not to open windows and to use garlic, but the maid Gerda [Olga Dickie] removes the garlic and opens the windows. The next morning, Lucy is dead. Van Helsing gives Harker's diary to Arthur to read.That evening, policemen bring home the maid's child Tania [Janine Faye] who reports seeing Lucy. Later that night, Van Helsing and Arthur go to Lucy's tomb. Van Helsing suggests that this is Dracula's revenge for the woman Harker staked. Van Helsing and Arthur go to the douane at Ingstadt to see where Dracula's coffin was bound (49 Frederichstrasse in Karlstadt). Meanwhile Mina gets a note to meet \"Arthur\" at 49 Frederichstrasse.

Jean Preston ('Patricia Morison' (qv)) heads an expedition to find her missing fiancee, Greg Jones. There are political parades on the streets and general unrest, but she is a brave girl, and she is escorted to the hotel where Greg last stayed, by her future father-in-law Colonel Jones ('John Miljan' (qv)) and an enthomologist Professor ('Wilson Benge' (qv)) slightly earing-impaired. An Indian girl in hiding listens to her talk with the hotel's concierge, then she disappears, only to reappear at Jean's room as soon the girl unpacks. Tundra ('Vida Aldana' (qv)) tells her name, and her story: her husband had been part of an expedition into the jungle a month before, and they had been attacked by a tiger, and two men had died. Mysteriously, she says that her husband refuses to speak for himself about the event because it was too dangerous.Meanwhile, from the hotel's veranda over a park, the two men are enjoying sportive events promoted by the government to calm down the people: separated by a low wall, two elephants engage in a tug-of-war under the instruction of their handlers.As Jean had shown her generosity with Tundra, the girl came back with her husband, Moya ('Hassam Kayyam' (qv)), and he promptly identifies the photo of the missing man, and starts to tell the itinerary they had taken. There is a hand holding a Luger from behind the baywindow's curtain, then a shot, and then Moya is dead. A mysterious man tells the reception desk there has been was a murder in room 207, and advises him to call the police at once. At the same minute. a man - Wayne Monroe ('Keith Richards' (qv)) - rushes into the hotel, and then the girl's room. He is with the party, and the way he holds Jean's arms may indicate that he has some protective feelings for her. They all decide to escape before the police inquest starts and the violence in the streets gets worse, so that their search for the missing Greg does not suffer a delay. They take an hydroplane to Kybo, Africa, as that was the last place Moya had mentioned before dying.The older men occupy themselves playing chess on a river boat, while Wayne complains about the tiresome wildlife views and the improbable results of their mission. Jean shows her determination to be strong.At Kybo, the Commissioner ('Jack George' (qv)) recruits Gary Lambert ('Robert Lowery' (qv)) as a guide for the expedition, but the sharp-shooter is reluctant to accept, as he considers that women are nuisances in a jungle safari. As they talk, Jean, forwarned by the Colonel about the young man's ideas about women, makes a surprise appearance at the target range, and puts 10 out of 10 bullets on the targets - thus winning the guide's attention.She's also able to convince Gabby ('J. Edward Bromberg' (qv)), a cook and a funny poet, to accompany them.Gary and Gabby take the expedition to an uncharted territory. Before starting the safari, they enjoy a folk dance played on the river bank by a group of male natives - some of whom then pose for the camera, showing peculiar apendages under their chins. By riverboat again, the expedition reaches \"the great falls of Africa\".Gary meets a Native Chief ('Darby Jones' (qv) in order to get forty men to carry their luggage, but the chief wants to show them some music and folk dance first. The Professor needs eye-glasses - but his eyes are keen on a beautiful native girl seating under a tree shade. They go the local market, to buy provisions. A couple of bags are conspicuously marked with the swastica cross.The local head-boy enslisted to carry supplies says the men are scared of voodoo, and further explains that the white woman - meaning Jean - is like the queen of the amazons, she-devils. At night, a fire-dance is done to dispell the men's fear of the white amazons - supposedly the only survivors of a safari twenty years ago, in which all men were killed. The children girls survived and came to dominate an isolated tribe.A gold coin is brought to them by a native, and Jean recognizes it as a gift she had given to her boyfriend; therefore, her hope of finding him alive is incenced. In the evening, Gary is attacked by a lion, wrestles with it, and after Wayne scares the lion way with a torch, Jean tends to his wounds. Gary tells her the lion had a collar around his neck - which is not usual with lions in the jungle. Gary suspects the killings may be about some ivory trafficking, and Jean starts to have tender feelings for him.Next morning, Wayne is found dead with an arrow through his back. Gary analyses a footprint and says that it was made to look like a native's, but that he thinks it was made by a white man used to wear shoes, and therefore one of the white people in the group should be the murderer. Shortly after, the lion attacks and mangles Bambo, the black boy that had brought them the gold coin, and the only who knew the location of the amazons. The men arrive too late to save Bambo's life, but put a bullet in the lion, who escapes and goes to his handler. The lion is petted by Zita, the Amazon Queen ('Amira Moustafa' (qv)) stops her love talk with Greg Jones ('Bruce Edwards' (qv)). Without his knowledge, she sends a message to the expedition, accepting to receive three, but only three of them. She is preparing them a reception with her blonde handmaid Suqi ('Cay Forester' (qv)).There are four men and the woman, and Gary - who seems to have taken the lead since Wayne's death - declares that he is in, followed by the Colonel, and Jean. Gary refuses to accept her in the smaller party, under the pretext that it may be dangerous, but she imposes her presence anyway.At last, the three arrive at the presence of the queen - who's got rid of Greg for the day - who puts it straight for them in simple words: no foreigner can be on her lands, she would have spared the lives of the other expeditionaries if she had known of their coming, and the man she saved is no prisoner, he's there on his own will. Jean counters that's well, so they can hear it from his own lips. \"Certainly, come with me!\" Zita offers, leading the way into her modest but solid house. Suqi brings in some refreshments, and Zita serves them the drinks along with her life history, and a couple of lies about Greg's absence. Then, alone with Jean, she tells her further that Greg is in love with her. Jean hears that stoically.Next, Gary manages to have a talk with Zita alone, too, and tells her that she does look like a friendly person, but that he actually came there to hear from her the name of the leader of the organization behind the ilegal ivory traffick. Zita seems about to reveal it, when Gabby makes a surprise appearance in the queen's house, preceded by his Luger. He is in command of the male natives, makes the men his prisoners, and orders them to be escorted outside.While Gabby stays with the women alone, Greg arrives at the head of a native force, and they fight Gabby's warriors. Greg enters the queen's house just in time to fight Gabby hand to hand just when he was about to kill the two women. Gabby had thrown a spear at Zita's belly, but missed by an inch, and also failed his sword thrust at Jean's head... After a long fistfight, the two men come apart and Gabby finally pulls his gun on Greg. Sugi, the queen's handmaid, shoots Gabby with a curare arrow, and he slides down to the floor, dying, and repeating the last verses of his poem about the men and women roles on earth.The Commissioner arrives late in the evening at the head of the soldiers, and so next morning he is presiding a double marriage: Gary and Zita, and Greg and Jean.

The killers, three women, preparing to leave, the leader of the three finds an air-hostess still alive, but after examining her eyes, she breaks the hostess' neck and the women jump out of the plane, allowing it to crash. In Berlin, a young criminal, Lena, lurks near a cash dispenser. Just as her victim has used the machine she pickpockets his credit card, but moments later her mark is arrested by the police. She flees, but a police officer, Tom, chases after her and eventually catches up with her on a bridge. After a short conversation, he tries to arrest her, but Lena hits him in the face, kicks him between the legs and jumps off the bridge onto a passing boat.Later that evening, Lena goes to a nightclub, which is run by Louise. Inside the club, Louise dances with Lena and offers her a drink. When Lena goes to the bathroom, Louise follows and bites her. The terrified Lena runs home. When she awakes in the morning, the sun burns her, forcing her to stay inside. That night, Lena returns to the club to confront Louise about what has happened. She meets Louise's two companions, the stoic Charlotte and the cheerful Nora. On Charlotte's suggestion, the women sell Lena to some Russian pimps to force her to accept her new state of being (the word \"vampire\" is never mentioned in the film). Lena attacks one of the mobsters as the tries to rape her, but she is shot by another pimp wielding a shotgun. The women enter the compound, killing the criminals, then set them ablaze, but fail to notice one mobster hiding in fear. Before leaving, Nora steals one of the mobster's Lamborghini. Coincidentally, Tom is assigned to investigate the murders, and he discovers a hidden video camera, which has recorded the attack, and, although the women cannot be filmed, the video does show the surviving criminal.When Lena awakes at the hotel, Louise gives her a glass of what appears to be blood. As Lena drinks, she feels her strength return. Louise bathes Lena and tells her the story of how she was changed. 280 years ago at a masked ball. At first she hated her maker, but grew to love her after traveling throughout Europe and getting to know all the benefits of the immortal life. After her maker was killed by sunlight, Louise wanted to commit suicide to join her, but instead began searching for a new companion. As Lena bathes, her short hair grows and returns to its natural color, her piercing falls out and she loses all bruises and wounds (including a tattoo on her belly).Lena spends a night shopping, partying and having fun with the women who give her the stolen Lamborghini. As they shop, Lena notices that Charlotte longingly staring at a pair of baby shoes, and shows other signs of depression and self-harm, including burning her own eyeball (which immediately heals) during dinner at an expensive restaurant. As the night comes to an end, the women return to their hotel to perform their morning ritual: allowing the first rays of sun burn their skin but retreating inside before any lasting harm can be done. Charlotte stays outside longer than the others, but retreats before catching fire. Louise kisses Lena, which startles and confuses Lena who bites Louise's lip, before she interrupts herself and begins cursing her hastiness.The next night when Lena returns home to pick up some belonings, she is meet by Tom, who used a file on Lena to find her home address. The two have coffee and talk, but when Lena suddenly sees Louise approaching, she uses her Lamborghini to retreat to the nightclub. She finds Charlotte in a private room where Charlotte tells Lena that she was a silent movie actress in the 1920s and that she had a husband and daughter. Louise enters the room and asks Lena why she is acting different. Lena lies that she misses the sun, so Louise takes the girls to Tropical Islands Resort that has artificial sunlight allowing them to have a pool party \"in the sun\". Two night watchmen find the girls and ask how they managed to get inside. Nora convinces the men to join them in the pool where she quickly kills off one of them, but the other tries to escape. Charlotte kills this man in a sadistic manner, slicing his throat with a piece of paper which causes him to die slowly and painfully. Lena flees the scene in terror.Tom and his partner, Lummer, interrogate the surviving mobster who says that the devil killed his friends and stole his Lamborghini. As van Gogh describes it Tom realizes that the stolen car is the car he saw Lena drive. The SEK (German SWAT unit) is invades the hotel. Charlotte stays to stall them while Lena, Louise &amp; Nora make their escape in special cars with tinted windows to protect them from sunlight. The police are slaughtered by Charlotte, but Tom manages to shoot Charlotte before she attacks him, causing her to fall out the window. Lena and Louise manage to get her inside their car. Nora's car crashes into another car and is thrown into sunlight and dies. The roof of the other car is ripped off by a roadblock and Louise crash into a subway to escape the scourging sunlight.The three remaining women hide at the abandoned Teufelsberg (The Devil's Mountain) where Louise has kept cash and prepare to flee to Russia. Before leaving, Charlotte demands to see her elderly daughter. At the retirement home Charlotte sings a lullaby to her dying daughter whom in her last moments recognizes her mother but thinks her mother is an Angel being the exact age to help her cross over upsetting Charlotte. With a whole day before their departure to Russia the girls return to their hideout to perform their morning ritual. As the sun rises, Charlotte locks Lena and Louise inside and allows the sun to kill her.Lena goes to Tom to say good bye and forces him to shoot her and the wound heals in front of his eyes to show her true nature. Lena begins to cry while Tom holds her and they fall asleep. Lummer, who has suspected Tom of having some involvement with the women since the hotel attack, has the SEK incarcerate them. Louise goes to the watchmen while they're in the shower and kills them (a deleted scene shows director Dennis Gansel playing one of the policemen getting killed). Louise ask Lena through an intercom how she would manage to live with a man destined to die, herself knowing the pain of losing a loved one. Louise kidnaps Tom and Lena follows her. At Teufelsberg, Louise wants Lena to tell her, \"I love you\". Lena does so and Louise says that that's the most beautiful lie she's ever heard and shoots Tom. Louise and Lena have a fight and Lena throws Louise into the sunlight, where she dies with a peaceful smile. Lena runs to Tom and wants to bite him, but stops, kisses him and begins to cry.At the end the SEK arrives with Lummer. Lena and Tom are gone with no trace other than Louise's gun. Lummer looks outside and sees something the other policemen and the audience don't.

Their younger sister Kalyani was raised in their home town by their father Manickampillai. In 1942, during World War II, her marriage is arranged with a writer named Thangappan, and the brothers plan to visit Madurai to attend the wedding. Due to war conditions and bombardment of Burmese ports by Japan, the shipping company offers only one ticket and Gunasekaran, the youngest brother, takes it and leaves for Tamil Nadu. The ship however fails to reach on time due to the dangers of the war, and Kalyani's marriage takes place without any of her brothers present.Kalyani becomes pregnant. But on the day she delivers her child, Thangappan dies in an accident and Manickampillai dies of shock, leaving Kalyani and her child destitute. Her house gets auctioned off, and she makes her living by selling food on the streets. Gunasekaran, after being stranded at sea for several months, finally arrives in Tamil Nadu at Madras. However, while watching a dance performance, he is robbed of all his belongings after being intoxicated. Reduced to poverty, he becomes enraged at the status of the once glorious Tamil Nadu, and fakes insanity by indulging in numerous tricks to make a living. Gunasekaran finally comes across his destitute sister at Madurai, having learned of their father's death and her poverty. He continues to play insane and does not reveal his true identity to her due to his poverty, but hovers around her. Kalyani is irritated by the stranger's behaviour, unaware that he is her brother.Kalyani is nearly molested by a vagabond named Venu, but is saved by Gunasekaran. She later leaves Madurai and arrives at Tiruchi, where she obtains work as a maid of blackmarketeer Narayana Pillai, who also tries to molest her. She is, however, saved by his wife Kantha, and leaves the job. While searching for his sister, Gunasekaran reaches Tiruchi and comes across Vimala, a wealthy woman, to whom he explains the miserable status of him and his sister in the society. After resting in her house for a while, he silently leaves to continue searching for Kalyani.Meanwhile, as Japanese shelling intensifies in Burma, Chandrasekaran and Gnanasekaran decide to return to India. Chandrasekaran, accompanied by his wife Saraswati, reaches Tiruchi safely and becomes a judge, but Gnanasekaran is lost in the journey and loses a leg in the shelling before arriving in India. He begs for a living, forms an association for beggars and tries to reform them. Kalyani reaches Chandrasekaran's palatial house seeking food, but Chandrasekaran throws her out without recognising her. She later arrives at a temple seeking help, but the pujari (priest) also tries to molest her. Frustrated with life and unable to feed her child, Kalyani throws it into a river and attempts suicide, but is soon arrested for killing the child and brought for trial.At the court, Kalyani defends her act of infanticide with the judge being Chandrasekaran, who after hearing her tragic story realises she is his sister, and faints. Gunasekaran is also brought to the court for having attacked the priest who tried to molest his sister. During his trial, Gunasekaran explains the misfortunes which has befallen him and his family, and justifies his actions. Gunasekaran's valiant defence in court awakens everyone on the evils of the society. As the trial proceeds, Vimala arrives and produces Kalyani's child, which was revealed to have safely fallen in her boat instead of the river. Kalyani and Gunasekaran are pardoned and acquitted by the court, and are finally reunited with Chandrasekaran. Gnanasekaran, while collecting donations for his association of beggars, also joins them unexpectedly.

Margaret (Posey) is the polar opposite, and serves as a catalyst to help Iris become more assertive. Paula (Kudrow) eagerly awaits post-work happy hours and the chance to flirt with attractive men. Jane (Ubach) is engaged to marry a jerk who is already cheating on her. Margaret hopes to become a permanent employee as an assistant to Mr. Lasky (Bob Balaban), but her dreams are thwarted when he suddenly dies. The four temps form a camaraderie which assists them in getting through their boring and tedius days at work.A series of thefts occur in the office and suspicion falls on the temps, particularly Margaret. When Iris finds a plastic monkey inside Margaret's desk that she had thought was stolen, Iris loses faith in Margaret and believes that she is the office thief. Margaret suggests a one-day strike from work due to mistreatment and being under appreciated as temps, and her friends halfheartedly agree to join her, but on the appointed day Margaret is the only one who does not come to work. As a result, the company's officious head of human resources (Debra Jo Rupp) fires Margaret, and management micromanages the remaining three temps. Iris, Paula and Jane's friendship comes to an end as result of the stress, ending the camaraderie among the temporary workers, and eventually they all go their separate ways. Paula is upset when she learns of Jane's wedding from a newspaper announcement, to which she was not invited, and leaves to work in another department.It is later discovered that another employee (a rich girl who was hired as a permanent employee after her first day) was the thief and that Margaret simply had a similar toy in her desk.

While making love in the woods they are discovered by three young local guys with rifles and a jar of self-made alcohol, which they force-sell to them. They seem to be the bad guys but as we will see, they're not. They also meet a middle-aged, rather conservatively dressed woman with a little wooden cart on a forest trail, who sends them on the Timber Falls trail, claiming that would be the most rewarding of all. She also asks them if they are married, which they are not (remember this for later). Next person they meet is a park ranger, who reassures them of the beauty of the Timber Falls trail. This happens shortly after Sheryl forces Mike to get rid of their handgun. He throws the bullets in a little creek.They arrive at a beautiful lake where they set up their tent and make love in the night. Somebody is watching them from outside the tent.The next morning Sheryl takes a swim in the lake and is abducted by a strange looking figure. Mike awakes and can only find Sheryl's necklace in the water.After meeting two of the three guys again and having a fight with them suspecting them of taking Sheryl, Mike gets caught in a bear trap and passes out.He awakes in a farmhouse and is taken care of by the woman they met earlier, called Ida. He gets suspicious after a while and asks her to call park service, which she declines. Soon the real scheme becomes clear: It is all a trap set up by Ida and the park ranger Clyde, who are in fact a couple who live there, desperately trying to get a child, but all their attempts so far have failed because the fetuses die in the womb. They want a (married!) couple so the husband can get his wife pregnant in their basement dungeon and, after nine months, they hopefully have their baby (the young couple would instantly get killed afterwards, of course). All their dead fetuses (10 or 12!) are on display in the dungeon in large jars with name plates attached.Now we get fully introduced to the strange beauty of the dungeon underneath the farmhouse: a crazy and distorted catholic shrine with a big crucified Jesus with a blinking X-mas light chain around him and many candles. Sheryl is strapped to a gynecologist's chair and while trying to rescue her, Mike gets caught and is chained to the ceiling of an adjacent torture chamber by a grotesquely disfigured man (he took Sheryl from the lake), later identified as Ida's brother Deacon, who got severely burned in the face in an \"accident\" years ago, constantly exposing his teeth. He doesn't talk since his vocal chords were also destroyed. His favorite weapon is a double blade sickle.After a surreal \"wedding\" with Clyde serving as a priest (\"The child must be conceived in wedlock\", they state, being totally deranged fundamentalist catholics), Mike and Sheryl are then left alone to have sex and Mike is supposed to get her pregnant, which he refuses. Mike is then tortured by Deacon with a whip and alcohol. Later, as he still refuses, cussing and calling them sick perverts, he gets burned with a red-hot branding iron but still refuses. Sheryl gets her pinky finger hacked off because since he refuses, she's the one to get tortured. Sheryl also reveals she's already two months pregnant, making the \"wedding\" useless since the child was conceived \"in sin\".The other park rangers get alerted when a report comes in regarding the missing couple. The three young locals also get suspicious and try to rescue Mike and Sheryl but all die violent and gory deaths.In the end Ida gets decapitated, Clyde gets his throat cut with a scalpel, Deacon gets burned alive and Mike and Sheryl have lived through their ordeal.One year later, back home, they put their cute baby to sleep, Mike still walking with a cane, when the camera pans to the window....and we see Deacon's double blade sickle emerge outside.

Thery are given new cars and meet with the criminal Carter Verone's henchmen, and Monica introduces them to Carter (Cole Hauser).

In preparation for the attack, a group of Baltic paratroopers are assigned to penetrate enemy lines and ascertain the position of enemy reserves. At headquarters, the troopers meet Kostyuk, the commander of the operation, and marvel as he shrewdly interrogates a German prisoner. After Kostyuk introduces them to their guide, Lisa Elenko, the soldiers parachute into a factory near Lubovonov, which the Germans are using as divisional headquarters. The Russians capture their objective, but in the raid, the factory is severly bombed and collapses. In its subterranean cellar, only Lisa, Alexei Kulkov, one of the paratroopers, and seven German soldiers survive. After taking the Germans prisoner, Alexei finds a German officer's revolver among their possessions and determines to unmask the officer hiding among the enlisted men. Above ground, in the ruins, Alexei's dog claws at the rubble while the sole surviving Russian taps a message to those below. When Alexei responds in code and instructs the Russian to report that a German officer has been captured, the Germans scoff at Alexei's claim until he silences them by showing them the revolver. As Alexei interrogates the Germans, the dog and the Russian steal through the night across enemy lines. When the Russian is killed by German bullets, Alexei's dog continues his trek to headquarters. Meanwhile, in the cellar, Alexei questions Mueller, a professor in civilian life, who begins to rant about an anti-German book that he has written. When Alexei becomes mesmerized by Mueller's diatribe, the Germans attack. Although Lisa and Alexei fend off their attackers, Lisa is stabbed in the assault. In retaliation, Alexei announces that he intends to kill the Germans, one by one, until he finds their commander. After ordering the sergeant behind a wall, Alexei knocks him out and then fires his gun, causing the Germans to believe that he has killed him. As Alexei confronts his next victim, the man defiantly proclaims that he is Major Ernemann. When the sound of tanks rumble above ground, the major taunts Alexei with images of imminent defeat and suggests that if he is so certain of Russian victory, he should have no qualms about exchanging invasion plans. Alexei, determined to elicit the location of the concentration of German forces, offers to trade information with the major. After the major pinpoints the site of the German tank division, Alexei shows him the Russian crossing point in the river. In exchange for the name of the village in which the German troops are to assemble, Alexei tells the major about the underwater bridge. Lisa, shocked by Alexei's revelation, urges him to kill the Germans before they can use the information. Alexei rejects Lisa's advice, claiming that he must first ascertain whether the major has told the truth. As the bridge nears completion, Alexei's dog reaches headquarters and then leads the troops across the bridge to his trapped master. Meanwhile, in the cellar, Alexei pretends to fall asleep and one of the Germans awakens him and offers to be his ally. Alexei then hands the German a rifle and drifts off to sleep. Later he is awakened by the sound of digging. When the major charges toward their rescuers, shouting the Russian plan of attack, Alexei shoots him. Thinking that the German army is breaking into the cellar, Alexei is about to pull the pin in his grenade when he sees his dog and the Russian army burst through the rubble. After Lisa is carried out on a stretcher, Alexei turns over his prisoners and reports the details of the German invasion plan. Taking the rifle from the German's hands, Alexei reveals that it holds no bullets and then collapses from fatigue.", "output": "Question: Who is planning to strike?, Answer: Workers, Students and Polyticians, Question: Who kills the eighth German solider?, Answer: Alexei Kulkov, Question: What two countries are involved in this movie?, Answer: Germany and Russia, Question: What time of day does the secret construction take place?, Answer: Night, Question: Who tells the truth, Kulkov or von Sturmer?, Answer: Kulkov, Question: Who is secretly constructing a bridge?, Answer: Russian engineers, Question: who hears german voice?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Who woke up Kulkov?, Answer: one of the germans, Question: Where are Germany and the Soviet Union gathering forces and supplies?, Answer: Lubovonov, Question: What must Kulkov do by himself?, Answer: unmask the officer hiding among the prisoners, Question: How does Kulkov's comrade communicate with him?, Answer: By tapping a code, Question: Why is the bridge being constructed?, Answer: Russian tanks plan to launch a counter-attack, Question: Who knocks out the German, then fired one round?, Answer: Alexei Kulkov, Question: What are the Soviets secretly building?, Answer: Bridge, Question: Where is the bridge being built to avoid detection?, Answer: Under cover of darkness, Question: What year does the movie take place?, Answer: 1942, Question: Where is Elenko stabbed?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Who is the partisan guide?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Kulkov finds a pistol and what other item that convinces him one of the prisoners is an officer in disguise?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Does von Sturmer believe Kulkov?, Answer: Not until he reveals the secret of the underwater bridge in an argument, Question: Where is the bridge being constructed?, Answer: beneath a river facing German lines, Question: What is the highest rank of the prisoners?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Who is Nazi Germany joining forces with?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: What was the full name of the Major played by Harro Meller?, Answer: Major Erich von Sturmer, Question: who launched their offensive?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: How many Germans were taken to the basement?, Answer: <No Answer>", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (March 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)While in Central City, Louisiana, orphans Andi (Emma Roberts) and Bruce (Jake T. Austin) manage to sell a rock in a box to a pawn shop to buy food for their dog, Friday (played by a dog named Cosmo), a Jack Russell Terrier. However, they are quickly caught and marched off to the police station, where their social worker, Bernie Wilkins (Don Cheadle) picks them up and takes them back to their foster parents, Lois and Carl Scudder (Lisa Kudrow and Kevin Dillon, respectively), who appear not to care for either Andi or Bruce. When the two demand to know where their foster children have been, Bernie covers for them, telling them that it was his fault they were late. Despite his sympathies towards the two siblings, he warns them that they are playing a dangerous game by deliberately getting into trouble in order to escape Carl and Lois, since they could get fostered separately, something that both orphans are desperate to avoid. During Bernie's visit, Friday returns home and Bruce quickly bustles Bernie out of the door, since Friday's presence is to be kept secret.The next morning, Andi and Bruce are horrified to find that Friday has snuck inside and is dangerously close to Lois discovering him. After a close call, Andi and Bruce rush Friday back to their bedroom, where Friday promptly goes looking for food again, only to be caught by Animal Control. Sick with worry, Andi and Bruce go into a local pet shop to ask if anybody has seen him; there, they meet Dave, (Johnny Simmons) and Heather, (Kyla Pratt) who advise them to check the Pound. Upon learning that Friday is indeed in the Pound but they cannot claim him unless their parents are there, Andi pays for Friday's return instead and suggests to Bruce that they find Friday a new home, since he deserves a real home with a real family. Whilst walking home, they find a gang of youths having stolen a ghetto-blaster radio, only to flee before the police arrive. Andi and Bruce try to outrun the police (the same two who had caught them earlier) and manage to hide in a nearby abandoned hotel formerly known as \"Hotel Francis Duke\". Whilst looking for Friday, who had curiously begun to explore the hotel, they find a tiny Boston Terrier and an English Mastiff, whom they later name Georgia and Lenny, respectively. Confident that the three dogs are getting along, Andi and Bruce leave Friday at the hotel for the night.The next morning, Andi and Bruce quickly return to the hotel to feed the dogs and to stop Lenny from getting caught due to howling because of lack of the city's view, with Andi warning her younger brother to not get too attached to the two stray dogs after naming them. Whilst Bruce stays at the hotel to keep the dogs quiet and creates a machine that allows them to play 'Fetch' whenever they like, Andi heads to the pet shop to get some food for the strays, claiming that her parents rescue dogs, prompting Dave to ask her to take in three more dogs - Shep: a Border Collie with herding issues, Romeo: a shy Chinese Crested Dog seeking romance, and Cooper: a British Bulldog with the ability to chew through anything (including a license plate) - who nobody seems to want to adopt since they aren't puppies anymore. Andi begrudgingly agrees. Upon arriving at the hotel, Dave and Heather immediately agree to help the two siblings out. With six dogs to now look after, the friends set about trying to get the hotel in a decent enough state to suit the dogs' needs, including building running machines, automatic feeders, modified lavatories, and a car simulator. Whilst they're working, a local boy named Mark offers his assistance. When Bruce brings in another dog: a Beauceron he found scrounging for food in a junkyard and which he named Henry, the group finally decides to set out and rescue more stray dogs from dog catchers, abusive owners, abandonment, certain death, former poor homes, bad conditions, and other types of bad situations. Soon, more strays begin to occupy the hotel. One of them, a white French Poodle, becomes Romeo's new love interest and is therefore named Juliet afterwards.Back at the Scudder's household, Bernie eagerly tells them of a couple of new foster parents he's found for Andi and Bruce. However, their new foster parents live 3 hours away so, the two turn the offer down in order to continue looking after the dogs, much to Bernie's bewilderment. Whilst thinking over her decision, Dave invites Andi to a party and she happily accepts; Mark, meanwhile, makes various efforts to gain Heather's attention. Whilst everyone else is at the party, Bruce is caught stealing a hairdryer from Lois and is immediately interrogated by Lois and Carl; meanwhile, Andi bumps into an old acquaintance named Jason, who accidentally notifies everyone that Andi is an orphan living with the Scudders in the same building his grandmother lives in. After an accident with some Punch, Andi leaves in shame and embarrassment and Dave follows her. Bruce manages to escape his house, only to find the hotel in a bad state due to an automatic feeder malfunction and a dogfight over a bone, then, Andi arrives; Lois and Carl follow him and the police are called. Andi and Bruce round up the dogs and hide in a darkened room, but after one dog howls due to barely any light in the room, the dogs are quickly caught and sent to the Pound, while Bruce and Andi are taken away by officers Mike and Jeff. When Lois and Carl refuse to take Andi and Bruce back, Bernie has no choice but to send them to separate foster homes.With all of the dogs to be put down the next day, Friday manages to escape his captivity and rushes over to find Dave, Heather, and Mark, who in turn find Andi. They all hurry over to find Bruce. Meanwhile, Bernie decides to look around the hotel, where he finds a Beagle named Harley who managed to avoid being caught the previous night, and marvels at the creations Bruce made, thus, begins to see why the kids loved doing what they did so much. Andi and Bruce manage to break into the Pound and release the dogs, where Bruce entices the horde of dogs to follow Dave's van through the city with sausages to a city limit where they can't be harmed while Mark stays behind to fight and hold off one of the dog catchers, who was trying to take Heather away to jail when he spotted her helping the siblings with their plan to rescue the dogs. The strange event attracts the attention of everyone in the city, including the police, who follow the dogs to the hotel after Friday leads them back when they realize that the hotel is their true home, where Bernie is waiting. With a large crowd gathered outside and before the cops try to take away the kids and the dog catchers try to capture the dogs again, Bernie shows up and tells the crowd a heartfelt speech about how Bruce, Andi, and everyone else managed to create a family of dogs and lists the names of the dogs and their former backstories (before being rescued) written in the hotel's old reception book by Bruce, who live at the hotel; winning the public's hearts, including the cops as well. The dog catchers are then called off, the pound is supposedly shut down, and the police, who always kept a close eye on the kids, allow to keep the dogs together.As people eagerly explore the hotel and after Andi and Dave share a kiss, Bernie reveals to an overjoyed Andi and Bruce that despite not being able to find new foster parents, he and his wife Carol have decided to adopt them. Mark, having returned to the hotel, finally wins Heather's affections as he gratefully receives a kiss on the cheek by her as part of a baby step. A few months later, the hotel re-opens as a grand \"Hotel For Dogs\", where people can either adopt strays or board their dogs. Dave is made the new hotel manager while Heather is the new hotel guide. Lenny and Georgia (having supposedly pursued a romantic relationship with Henry) are a few of the dogs working as porters while Cooper works in the recycle bin as he chews off everything recyclable.

A group of gypsies sneak illegally into Paris, but are ambushed by Judge Claude Frollo, the minister of justice. A gypsy woman in the group attempts to flee with her deformed baby, but Frollo chases and kills her outside Notre Dame. He tries to kill the baby as well, but the cathedral's archdeacon intervenes and accuses Frollo of murdering an innocent woman. To atone for his sin, Frollo reluctantly agrees to raise the deformed child in Notre Dame as his son, naming him Quasimodo.Twenty years later, Quasimodo develops into a kind yet isolated young man who has lived inside the cathedral his entire life. A trio of living stone gargoyles\u00e2\u0080\u0094Victor, Hugo, and Laverne\u00e2\u0080\u0094serve as Quasimodo's only company, and encourage him to attend the annually-held Festival of Fools. Despite Frollo's warnings that he would be shunned for his deformity, Quasimodo attends the festival and is celebrated for his awkward appearance, only to be humiliated by the crowd after Frollo's men start a riot. Frollo refuses to help Quasimodo, but Esmeralda, a kind gypsy, intervenes by freeing the hunchback, and uses a magic trick to evade arrest. Frollo confronts Quasimodo and sends him back inside the cathedral.Esmeralda follows Quasimodo inside, only to be followed herself by Captain Phoebus of Frollo's guard. Phoebus refuses to arrest her for alleged witchcraft inside Notre Dame and instead has her confined to the cathedral. Esmeralda finds and befriends Quasimodo, who helps her escape Notre Dame out of gratitude for defending him. She entrusts Quasimodo a pendant containing a map to the gypsies' hideout, the Court of Miracles. Frollo soon develops lustful feelings for Esmeralda and, upon realizing them, begs the Virgin Mary to save him from her \"spell\" to avoid eternal damnation. When Frollo discovers that she escaped, he instigates a city-wide manhunt for her which involves setting fire to countless houses in his way. Phoebus is appalled by Frollo's evil reputation and defies him. Frollo then sentences Phoebus to death. Phoebus is struck by an arrow and falls into the River Seine, but Esmeralda rescues him and takes him to Notre Dame for refuge. The gargoyles encourage Quasimodo to confess his feelings for Esmeralda, but he is heartbroken to discover she and Phoebus have fallen in love.Frollo returns to Notre Dame later that night and discovers that Quasimodo helped Esmeralda escape. He bluffs to Quasimodo saying that he knows about the Court of Miracles and that he intends to attack at dawn. Using the map Esmeralda gave him, Quasimodo and Phoebus find the court to warn the gypsies, only for Frollo to follow them and capture all the gypsies present. Frollo prepares to burn Esmeralda at the stake after she rejects his advances, but Quasimodo rescues her and brings her to the cathedral. Phoebus releases the gypsies and rallies the citizens of Paris against Frollo and his men, who try to break into the cathedral. Quasimodo and the gargoyles pour molten lead onto the streets to ensure no one enters, but Frollo successfully manages to enter. He pursues Quasimodo and Esmeralda to the balcony where he and Quasimodo both fall over the edge. Frollo falls to his death in the molten lead, while Quasimodo is caught by Phoebus on a lower floor. Afterward, Quasimodo comes to accept that Phoebus and Esmeralda are in love, and he gives them his blessing.

The villagers refuse to attend Mass at the Catholic church because the shadow of Dracula's castle touches it. To bring to an end the villagers' fears, Mueller climbs to the castle to exorcise it.Count Dracula and Maria MuellerThe terrified priest follows only partway up the mountain, and Mueller continues alone. As he exorcises the castle, attaching a large metal cross to its gate, a thunderstorm occurs. The priest flees, stumbles, and is knocked unconscious when his head strikes a rock. The blood from the head wound trickles into a frozen stream through a crack in the ice, and onto the lips of Count Dracula, reviving him. Mueller returns to the village, reassures the villagers, and returns to his home city of Kleinenberg where he lives with his widowed sister-in-law, Anna (Marion Mathie).Unknown to Mueller, Dracula takes control of the priest. Furious that his castle is now barred to him, Dracula forces the enslaved priest to reveal the name of the exorcist. The priest desecrates a coffin to provide a sleeping place for the Count, and leads Dracula to Kleinenberg, where the Count takes his revenge on the Mueller's beautiful niece, Maria (Veronica Carlson). Dracula enslaves Zena the tavern girl (Barbara Ewing). Zena almost succeeds in bringing Maria under Dracula's power, but Maria's boyfriend Paul (Barry Andrews), who lives and works in the bakery beneath the tavern, rescues her. Dracula punishes Zena by killing her. Dracula orders the priest to burn Zena's corpse in the bakery ovens before she turns into a vampire. The priest then helps Dracula locate Maria. Dracula climbs over the rooftops of nearby buildings, enters Maria's room, and bites her.Mueller enters Maria's room just after Dracula has bitten the girl and pursues a fleeing figure across the rooftops.

An expedition led by a young man called Valerian (Clarke) seeks the last sorcerer, Ulrich of Craggenmoor (Richardson), for help. A brutish soldier from Urland named Tyrian (Hallam), who has followed the expedition, intimidates the wizard. Ulrich invites Tyrian to stab him to prove his magical powers. Tyrian does so and Ulrich dies instantly, to the horror of his young apprentice Galen Bradwarden (MacNicol) and his elderly servant Hodge (Sydney Bromley). Hodge cremates Ulrich's body and places the ashes in a leather pouch, informing Galen that Ulrich wanted his ashes spread over a lake of burning water.Galen inherits the wizard's magical amulet, and takes it upon himself to journey to Urland. On the way, he discovers Valerian is really a young woman, who disguised herself to avoid being selected in the lottery. In an effort to discourage the expedition, Tyrian kills Hodge; before dying, he hands Galen the pouch and dies with the words \"Burning water...\" on his lips.Arriving in Urland, Galen inspects the dragon's lair and attempts to seal its entrance by causing rocks to fall from the cliff. Tyrian apprehends Galen and takes him to the court of King Casiodorus. King Casiodorus guesses that Galen is not a real wizard and complains that his attack may have angered the dragon instead of killing it, as his own brother and predecessor once did. The king confiscates the amulet and imprisons Galen. His daughter Elspeth (Chloe Salaman) comes to taunt Galen, but is shocked when he informs her of rumours that the lottery is rigged to exclude her name and those who are rich enough to pay to have their children' names removed. Casiodorus is unable to lie convincingly when she confronts him regarding this.Meanwhile, the dragon frees itself from its prison and causes an earthquake. Galen narrowly escapes, but without the amulet. The village priest, Brother Jacopus (Ian McDiarmid), leads his congregation to confront the dragon, denouncing it as the Devil, but the dragon incinerates him and then heads for the village, burning all in its path.When the lottery begins anew, Princess Elspeth rigs the draw so that only her name can be chosen. The King returns the amulet to Galen so that he might save Elspeth. Galen uses the amulet to enchant a heavy spear that had been forged by Valerian's father (which he had dubbed Sicarius Dracorum, or \"Dragonslayer\") with the ability to pierce the dragon's armored hide. Meanwhile, Valerian gathers some molted dragon scales and uses them to make Galen a shield, and the two realize they have romantic feelings for each other. As Galen attempts to rescue Princess Elspeth, he fights and kills Tyrian. The Princess, determined to make amends for all the girls whose names had been chosen in the past, descends into the dragon's cave and to her death. Galen follows her and finds a brood of young dragons feasting on her corpse. He kills them and finds Vermithrax nesting by an underground lake of fire. He manages to wound the monster but the spear is broken. Only Valerian's shield saves him from incineration.After his failure to kill Vermithrax, Valerian convinces Galen to leave the village with her. As the two lovers prepare to leave, the amulet gives Galen a vision that explains his teacher's final wishes. Ulrich had asked that his ashes be spread over \"burning water\", and Galen realizes that the wizard had planned his own death and cremation after realizing he was not physically able to make the journey by himself. He used Galen to deliver him to Urland. Galen returns to the cave. When the ashes are spread over the lake, the wizard is resurrected within the flames. Ulrich reveals that his time is short and that Galen must destroy the amulet when the time is right. The wizard then transports himself to the mountaintop and confronts the dragon. After a brief battle, the monster grabs the old man and flies away with him. Galen crushes the amulet with a rock, causing the wizard to explode and kill the dragon, whose corpse falls out of the sky.Inspecting the wreckage, the villagers credit God with the victory. The king arrives and drives a sword into the dragon's broken carcass to claim the glory for himself. As Galen and Valerian leave Urland together, he confesses that he misses both Ulrich and the amulet. He says \"I just wish we had a horse,\" and a white horse appears to take the incredulous lovers away.", "output": "Question: What is Vermithrax Pejorative?, Answer: 400-year-old dragon, Question: How does King Casiodorus appease the dragon?, Answer: By offering vrgin girls selected by lottery twice a year., Question: Where did Galen and Valerian leave from?, Answer: Urland., Question: What does the King confiscate?, Answer: Amulet., Question: who kills hodge?, Answer: tyrian, Question: What is the kings name?, Answer: Casiodorus, Question: How does Galen crush the amulet?, Answer: with a rock, Question: Who leads a congregation to confront the dragon ?, Answer: The village priest, Brother Jacopus leads his congregation to confront the dragon, Question: How does Galen attempt to seal the dragons entrance?, Answer: Causing rocks to fall from a cliff., Question: Who did villagers credit the victory to?, Answer: God., Question: Princess Elspeth rigs the lottery draw, so that only who's name can be drawn?, Answer: Hers., Question: What does the dragon cause after freeing itself ?, Answer: The dragon causes an earthquake after freeing itself., Question: Where does the wizard transport himself?, Answer: the top of the mountain, Question: what does galen discover about valerian?, Answer: Valerian is really a young woman, Question: What gives Galen a vision?, Answer: the amulet, Question: What is Urland?, Answer: A sixth-century post-Roman kingdom, Question: When Galen wounds the monster, he is only saved by what item?, Answer: Valerian's shield., Question: Galen uses what to enchant the spear that was made by Valerian's father?, Answer: The amulet.", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Maurice's friend describes the great-niece as a trouble maker and a nuisance, but Maurice discovers that Jessie warms up to him when he starts interacting with her. He takes her to the National Gallery in London, England to view his favourite painting, the Rokeby Venus, by the Spanish artist Diego Vel\u00e1zquez.Jessie had expressed interest in modelling (Maurice initially mis-hears this as \"yodelling\") and Maurice arranges for Jessie to model nude for an art class. As a result of Jessie posing for the art class, and inspired by his favourite painting, Maurice decides to give Jessie the nickname \"Venus\". Maurice and Jessie develop a passive/aggressive relationship over the course of the film. Maurice is forward in terms of his attraction towards Jessie while Jessie occasionally indulges his whims to a limited extent, such as touching her hand and smelling her neck, but also retracts the indulgences when she feels that he has gone too far. The plot of the film revolves around the evolving friendship or relationship between the two characters. For Maurice, this appears to be the last attempt at something approaching a love life, as his prostate operation has left him impotent. For Jessie, it is less clear what she sees in Maurice. During the course of the film we see her do everything from exploiting him (trying to get him to buy her presents, trying to use his flat to have sex with a boy), taking care of him, flirting with him, and rejecting him sexually to engaging with him as a friend. During the course of the film we learn that she has been rejected by her mother and great-uncle for her promiscuous life style; it is implied that she is drawn to Maurice because he does not judge her as harshly as her family members have.The plot comes to a head when Jessie becomes involved with a boy. The two young lovers convince Maurice to take a walk so that they can have sex. Maurice initially obliges the request, but returns to kick them out of his flat. A scuffle ensues and Jessie knocks down Maurice, injuring him. Jessie leaves with the boy and apparently spends the night out partying with him at clubs, later returning to check on Maurice. When the paramedics arrive, Maurice claims he cannot remember who attacked him, much to Jessie's surprise. Then Maurice calls for \"Venus\" to take care of him. Jessie, remorseful, agrees to look after Maurice. Some time later, after Maurice has at least partly recovered, he takes Jessie to the seaside at Whitstable in Kent.

Althea, who watches the race riots every night on TV with great interest, chastises Jeff for not having sympathy for the problems of black Americans.One morning, Jeff wakes up to find that his pigment has changed. He tries to fall back asleep, thinking that it is a dream, but to no avail. He tries taking a shower to wash the \"black\" off him, but finds it doesn't work, when Althea walks into the bathroom, and screams. He explains to her that the \"Negro in the bathroom\" is him.At first, Jeff believes this to be the result of spending too much time under the tanning machine.

The year is 1901 and Norgate is an avid supporter of Irish Home Rule, avid enough to plan this robbery to get the bullion needed to make his independence wishes come true.

She wants to move the team to Miami, which has promised her a sweetheart deal including a new stadium. In order to do this, she must reduce the season's attendance at Cleveland Stadium to under 800,000 tickets sold, which will trigger an escape clause in the team's lease with the city of Cleveland. Believing that finishing dead last will knock attendance down low enough for her to move, she instructs her new General Manager Charlie Donovan to hire the worst team possible from a list she has already prepared. The list includes veteran catcher Jake Taylor, who has problems with his knees and was last playing in Mexico; incarcerated pitcher Ricky Vaughn; power-hitting outfielder Pedro Cerrano, who practices voodoo to try to help him hit curve balls; veteran pitcher Eddie Harris, who no longer has a strong throwing arm and is forced to doctor his pitches; and third baseman Roger Dorn, a one-time star who is under contract but has become a high-priced prima donna. As manager, Phelps hires Lou Brown, a career minor league manager of the Toledo Mud Hens who works in the off-season as a tire salesman.At spring training in Tucson, Arizona, the brash but speedy center fielder Willie \"Mays\" Hayes crashes camp uninvited, but is invited to join the team after displaying his running speed. Spring training reveals several problems with the new players. Vaughn has an incredible fastball but lacks control. Hayes is able to run the bases quickly but hits only pop flies, and Cerrano, despite his tremendous power, cannot hit a curveball. The veterans have their own problems: Dorn refuses to aggressively field ground balls, afraid that potential injuries will damage his upcoming contract negotiations, and it becomes clear that Taylor's bad knees will be a season-long concern. On the final day, when Brown is to cut the team down to 25 players, Dorn plays a practical joke on Vaughn, making him believe he was cut, resulting in a locker-room brawl.After the team returns to Cleveland before the season begins, Taylor takes Vaughn and Hayes out to dinner but comes across his ex-girlfriend Lynn, who is dining with her current beau. Taylor believes he can try to win her back by proclaiming that he has a major league job again, but is disappointed to hear that she is already engaged.The Indians' season starts off poorly. Vaughn's initial pitching appearances end in disaster, with his wild pitches earning him the derogatory title \"Wild Thing.\" On a rare occasion when Vaughn does get a ball over the plate, it is hit well over 400 feet by the New York Yankees' best hitter, Clu Haywood. Brown discovers that Vaughn's eyesight is poor; once Vaughn gets glasses his control greatly improves, and he becomes the team's ace. Despite their flaws, the team begins to improve, so Phelps decides to demoralize them further by removing luxuries, such as replacing their team jet airplane first with a dilapidated prop plane, then with an old bus. However, these changes do not affect the Indians' performance and the team continues to win. One night after an Indians loss where the team showed great promise, Brown mentions to Donovan that the team could do much better, perhaps even providing a few All-Stars for the league, if there was one thing to pull them all together. Donovan reveals Phelps' plan to Brown, who then relays the same news to the players. Brown also tells them that if the team plays too well for Phelps to void the lease, she will release them all regardless. With nothing to lose, the team agrees to get back at Phelps by winning the pennant. Brown motivates the team further by providing a double-layered cardboard cutout of Phelps from her showgirl days; after every victory, a piece of the second layer is removed, eventually presenting a nude picture of Phelps.The team plays very well down the stretch of the season, and clinch a tie for first in the American League East by beating the Chicago White Sox on the last day of the season. This forces a one-game playoff with the division's co-leaders, the Yankees. Prior to the playoff, Taylor continues to try to woo Lynn back and they share a night together. Vaughn learns that he will not be the starting pitcher for the game and goes to a bar to mope, where he encounters Suzanne Dorn. Feeling spited after witnessing her husband Roger with another woman; she retaliates by luring Vaughn to sleep with her. Vaughn is unaware of who she is until she tells him before leaving the apartment.Taylor advises Vaughn to keep his distance from Dorn for most of the game by staying in the bullpen. The game remains scoreless until the seventh inning when Harris gives up two runs. Cerrano comes to the plate in the bottom of the seventh and misses badly on two curveballs. He angrily threatens his voodoo god Jo-bu, then hits the next pitch--another curve--for a two-run homer. In the top of the ninth, the Yankees are able to load the bases for the power-hitting Clu Haywood, and Lou decides to bring Vaughn in to pitch to him. While Taylor taunts Haywood from behind home plate, Vaughn strikes out his nemesis on three straight fastballs to end the inning.With two outs in the bottom of the ninth, Hayes manages an infield single. The Yankees respond by bringing in their headhunting closer, Duke Simpson, to pitch to Taylor. After Hayes steals second, Taylor and Lou trade signs in the dugout, and Taylor points to center field, calling his shot. The Duke responds by throwing a fastball straight at Taylor's head, but the catcher is undeterred and gets back up and points again. However, with Hayes running, Taylor bunts instead, catching the Yankees infield off-guard. Despite his weak knees, Taylor manages to beat out the throw to first as Hayes rounds third and heads for home plate. Hayes slides safely into home, giving the Indians the win on a walk-off single. As the team celebrates, Dorn punches Vaughn in the face but then helps him up to continue the celebration. Jake finds Lynn in the stands, who raises her left hand to show that she is no longer wearing an engagement ring, and they reunite as the film closes.", "output": "Question: What is the nickname of Ricky Vaughn due to his fastball but uncontrolled nature?, Answer: Wild Thing, Question: Who is trying to win back an ex-girlfriend who is engaged and living in Cleveland?, Answer: Roger Dorn, Question: Where was the playoff held?, Answer: Cleveland, Question: Whom does Phelps Hire to manage the team?, Answer: Lou brown, Question: Who hit a home run to tie the game?, Answer: Pedro Cerrano, Question: What is Roger Dorn's nature described as that could be termed a struggle?, Answer: He is a prima donna., Question: Who manages a single to get on base?, Answer: Willie hayes, Question: Who does Rachel think can bring the ragtag team together?, Answer: Charlie Donovan, Question: Was the alternate ending filmed and shown to test screening audiences before the movie's release?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: What will happen if Lou shares any of the conversation?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Which team did they tie the division with?, Answer: Yankees, Question: Who inherits Cleveland Indians baseball team?, Answer: Rachel phelps, Question: What was it that the team couldnt afford?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: From whom did Rachel Phelps inherit the club from?, Answer: Her dead husband, Question: WHO taylor signaling to CENTER field?, Answer: Duke simpson, Question: Is the alternate ending the same as the original ending?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: The club was on the brink of what when Phelps inherited it?, Answer: <No Answer>, Question: Who conceived the Miami scheme?, Answer: Rachel Phelps", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

When Raymar's body was lifted onto a stretcher, bolts of electricity shot out from his fingers. Not even his estranged daughter Olivia McKenna (Melissa Newman) or her husband Allan (Adam West) knows what happened until they meet Samuel Dockstader (Donald Hotton), a feature writer for \"The World of the Occult\". Dockstader, once a friend to Raymar, explains that Raymar was a psychic vampire who gained great powers of telekinesis by kidnapping young girls, terrorizing them, and feeding off the bioenergy they produced. Allan does not believe him, but Dockstader shows Olivia a set of photographs to demonstrate how bioenergy works and gives her an audiotape that outlines his findings, which convinces Olivia to believe him.High school student Julie Wells (Meg Tilly) wants nothing more than to be one of \"The Sisters,\" a club of three snobby high school girls\u00e2\u0080\u0094Carol (Robin Evans), Leslie (E.G.

That evening, Julie is dropped off by two of the \"Sisters\", Carol and Kitty, as Leslie had refused to accompany them on the plan. Julie explores the mausoleum and sets up her sleeping bag, unaware of the cracks that appear around Raymar's vault.Carol and Kitty, hoping to scare Julie, sneak back into the mausoleum in Halloween costumes. They succeed in frightening Julie, who locks herself in the chapel. Suddenly, the walls shake, windows explode, and doors slam shut. Thinking this is the result of Julie being scared, Carol and Kitty decide to leave. When vaults open, coffins slide out, the dead rise and surround them, and Kitty and Carol are buried under a mound of corpses and suffocate.Meanwhile, Steve has gone over to Julie's house and found her missing. He catches up with Leslie, who reluctantly tells Steve about Julie's initiation, and Steve angrily heads over to the mausoleum. At the same time, Olivia dashes over after learning about her father's powers and the possibility that she might also possess them. Back at the mausoleum, Raymar has broken out of his coffin and is controlling the doors and cadavers with his psychic powers. Steve breaks in and finds a hysterical Julie. They become surrounded by cadavers that advance toward them. Steve tries to fight the cadavers, but they knock him out. Raymar pulls a dazed Julie closer to him just as Olivia arrives. She tries out her powers on her father, but he is stronger. As a last effort, Olivia takes her compact and reflects the bolts from Raymar's eyes back at him, causing Raymar and the cadavers to disintegrate, saving Julie and Steve.The three, including a traumatized Julie, begin slowly walking out of the mausoleum.

The citizens live a hedonistic life but, to maintain the city, everyone must undergo the ritual of \"Carrousel\" [sic] when they reach the age of 30.[10] There, they are vaporized and ostensibly \"renewed\". To track this, each person is implanted at birth with a \"life-clock\" crystal in the palm of their hand that changes color as they get older and begins blinking as they approach their \"Last Day\". Most residents accept this promise of rebirth, but those who do not and attempt to flee the city are known as \"Runners\". An elite team of policemen known as \"Sandmen\", outfitted in predominantly black uniforms and serving in an agency of the city called \"Deep Sleep\", are assigned to pursue and terminate Runners as they try to escape.Logan 5 and Francis 7 are both Sandmen. After terminating a Runner, to whose presence they were alerted during a Carrousel ritual, Logan finds an ankh among his possessions. Later that evening, he meets Jessica 6, a young woman also wearing an ankh pendant. Logan takes the ankh to the computer, which tells him that it is a symbol for a secret group whose members help the Runners find \"Sanctuary\", a mythical place where they will be safe to live out the rest of their lives; it points out that the Sandmen have lost one thousand and fifty-six (1056) Runners that way. The computer instructs Logan to find Sanctuary and destroy it, a mission he has to keep secret from the other Sandmen of Deep Sleep, which it code-names \"Assignment 033-03\". It then (by a procedure it calls a \"retrogram\") changes the color of his life-clock to flashing red, making him technically and suddenly four years older. In order to escape Carrousel, Logan is now forced to become a Runner. Logan meets Jessica and explains his situation. They meet with the underground group that leads them to the periphery of the city. Logan finds that the ankh symbol is actually a key that unlocks an exit from the city. They come out into a frozen cave, with Francis following closely behind. In the cave, they meet Box, a robot designed to capture food for the city from the outside. Logan discovers to his horror that Box also captures escaped Runners and freezes them. Before he (Box) can freeze Logan and Jessica, they escape, causing the cave to collapse on Box.Once outside, Logan and Jessica notice that their life-clocks are no longer operational. They discover that the remains of human civilization have become a wilderness. They explore an old, seemingly abandoned city, which was once Washington D.C.. In the ruins of the United States Senate chamber, they discover an elderly man. His appearance is a shock to them since neither has seen anyone over the age of 30. The old man explains what he remembers of what happened to humanity outside the city, and Logan realizes that Sanctuary is a myth and had been all along. However, Francis has followed them and he and Logan fight. Logan fatally wounds Francis and as he dies, he sees that Logan's life-clock is now clear and assumes that Logan has renewed. Logan and Jessica persuade the old man to return to the city with them as proof that life exists outside the domed city. Leaving the man outside, the two enter and try to convince everyone that Carrousel is a lie and unnecessary. The two are captured by other Sandmen and taken to the computer. The computer interrogates Logan about Assignment 033-03 and asks if he completed his mission. But Logan insists, \"There is no Sanctuary.\" What he had found was \"old ruins, exposed\", \"an old man\", and that the missing Runners were \"all frozen\". These answers, however, are not accepted by the computer, even after scanning Logan's mind, and the computer inexplicably overloads, causing the city's systems to fail violently and release the exterior seals. Logan, Jessica, and the other citizens flee the ruined city. Once outside, the citizens see the old man, the first human they have met who is older than 30, proving that they can indeed live their lives much longer.", "output": "Question: What are the city's elite policemen called?, Answer: Sandmen, Question: WHAT DOES THE ANKH HELP THE RUNNERS FIND?, Answer: SANCTUARY, Question: What runs the city?, Answer: a computer, Question: Who do Logan and Jessica try to persuade to return with them?, Answer: The old man, Question: WHAT ARE LOGAN AND FRANCIS?, Answer: SANDMEN, Question: HOW OLD IS LOGAN?, Answer: 5, Question: What Assignment does the computer interrogate Logan about?, Answer: 033-03, Question: What was the abandoned city formally called?, Answer: Washington D.C., Question: WHAT DOES LOGAN FIND AMONG HIS POSSESSIONS?, Answer: ANKH, Question: In what year does the movie take place?, Answer: 2274, Question: Who does Logan fatally wound?, Answer: Francis, Question: WHO DO THEY MEET LATER WITH A ANKH PENDANT?, Answer: JESSICA, Question: What do Logan and Jessica notice are no longer operational once outside?, Answer: Life-clocks, Question: What does Logan realize is a myth?, Answer: Sanctuary, Question: WHAT DID LOGAN FIND OUT ABOUT THE BOX?, Answer: FREEZERS ESCAPED RUNNERS", "category": "Question Generation 809.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Jane is ecstatic when Mrs. Reed, eager to be rid of the child, arranges for Jane to be sent to Lowood Institution, a charity boarding school for young girls, run by the disciplinarian Reverend Brocklehurst (Henry Daniell).Based on what Mrs. Reed has told him, Mr. Brocklehurst labels Jane a liar in front of her schoolmates and orders her to stand on a stool for hours on her first day of attendance. She is comforted and befriended by another student, Helen Burns (Elizabeth Taylor). Later, Jane protests when Brocklehurst orders that Helen's naturally curling hair be cut. Both are punished by being forced to walk circles in a courtyard during a downpour. Dr. Rivers (John Sutton), a sympathetic physician who periodically checks on the students, brings them inside, but it is too late for Helen, who dies that night.Ten years later, in 1840, 20-year-old Jane (Joan Fontaine) turns down Brocklehurst's offer of a teaching position. She advertises for and accepts a job as governess for a young girl named Ad\u00c3\u00a8le (Margaret O'Brien). When she arrives at Thornfield, a gloomy, isolated mansion, she initially thinks her employer is Mrs. Fairfax (Edith Barrett), who is only the housekeeper for the absent master.Jane goes for a walk one night, only to startle a horse into throwing and slightly injuring its rider, Edward Rochester (Orson Welles)\u00e2\u0080\u0094who she doesn't realize is her employer. When Jane arrives back at Thornfield, she discovers this fact, and Rochester calls her into his library to interview her.That night, Jane is awakened by strange laughter. She investigates, and discovers that Mr. Rochester's bed curtains are on fire. She rouses the sleeping man and they extinguish the fire without rousing anyone. Rochester bids her wait while he goes to another wing of the house, where mysterious seamstress Grace Poole (an uncredited Ethel Griffies) keeps to herself. When he returns, he tells Jane nothing other than that the matter is under control. The next morning, he leaves Thornfield.A winter and spring go by before he returns with a large group of guests. Jane is greatly saddened when Mrs. Fairfax discloses that everyone expects Rochester to marry Blanche Ingram (Hillary Brooke). However, Rochester confides to Jane his conviction that Miss Ingram is attracted only by his wealth.When a man named Mason (an uncredited John Abbott) of Spanish Town, Jamaica, arrives at Thornfield, Jane sees that Rochester is disturbed. That night, a scream awakens everyone. Rochester assures his guests it is just a servant's reaction to a nightmare, but after he sends them back to their rooms, he has Jane secretly tend a bleeding Mason, while he fetches a doctor. Jane assumes Grace is responsible. Rochester has the doctor take Mason away.Rochester has a private conversation with Blanche, in which he bluntly asserts that she is a gold digger. Offended, she and the guests leave. Unaware of this development, Jane broaches the topic of her future employment elsewhere after Rochester gets married. He reveals to Jane that he intends to marry her.During the wedding ceremony, an attorney intervenes and declares that Rochester has a wife still living, who is mentally ill and deranged. This is confirmed by Mason, Rochester's brother-in-law. Rochester calls off the marital ceremony and takes them back to Thornfield to reveal his insane spouse, who lives in a tower cell, guarded by Grace Poole. Jane rejects Rochester's offer to stay together without being married. She departs Thornfield.With her funds exhausted, Jane returns to Gateshead. She discovers that her aunt has suffered a stroke, caused by worry over the ruinous gambling habits of her son, who it is revealed has committed suicide. There is a reconciliation. After Mrs. Reed dies, Jane ponders what to do next, when she hears an anguished and beloved male voice from thin air calling her name.Jane travels to Thornfield and finds it in ruins. Mrs. Fairfax informs her that the lunatic escaped, set the place on fire, and fled to the roof. When Rochester tried to rescue her, she jumped and was killed.
