Starting from the egg near the handle of the pan, remove each egg one by one with a slotted spoon, and drop it into the large bowl of cold water. Set the bowl aside., 2. Prepare the butternut squash: Warm the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat, then add the cubed butternut squash and the sea salt. Toss the pan to coat the squash, then cook for a few minutes, until the squash starts to get some color on the bottom. Give the pieces another toss to brown on all sides, and continue tossing every few minutes to get more color and to cook all of the pieces. If the pan dries out (you will know because the squash pieces will start to stick to the pan), add a bit more oil. When the squash is cooked through, remove the pan from the heat and set aside., 3. Prepare the miso soup: Bring the dashi stock to a simmer over medium heat. Add the spinach leaves and cook for about 20 seconds (just long enough for the leaves to wilt). Reduce the heat to low. Add the miso paste to the dashi, stirring the soup to combine everything. Add the poached eggs with a slotted spoon (so that the cold water drains off them when they are transferred) and reheat slightly (but do not boil)., 4. Divide the soup between 4 bowls, making sure that each bowl gets a poached egg, and garnish with the sauteed butternut squash cubes.", "output": "EGGS, Water, \u00bc, Eggs, _____, Butternut, Olive Oil, Salt, _____, Dashi Stock", "category": "Named Entity Recognition 1198.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you have to identify the named entities (NER) which are the ingredients required given its directions.
