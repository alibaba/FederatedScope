A \u201chigh fat, low carb\u201d ketogenic diet has been shown to be more efficacious for weight loss than a low-fat diet and improved other serum markers such as a greater decrease in triglycerides and an greater increase in HDL cholesterol. If you are on a ketogenic or very low carb (VLC) diet (e.g. with 50-100gr carb/day and/or eating ketone producing MCT oils such as coconut oil), you may have a dilemma of having high Blood Glucose (BG) despite eating LC: If you are keto adapted, that is, your body is using ketones and even though you have sufficient insulin (say >5 microU/ml) your body tries to keep your BG higher than necessary, e.g. above 100-110 mg/dl. But the ketogenic (keto) diet, high in fat and low in carbs, can potentially change the way your body stores and uses energy, easing diabetes symptoms. With the keto diet, your body converts fat, instead of sugar, into energy. The diet was created in 1924 as a treatment for epilepsy, but the effects of this eating pattern are also being studied for type 2 diabetes. The ketogenic diet may improve blood glucose (sugar) levels while also reducing the need for insulin.

Many people ask: \u201cWhy is my fasting blood glucose higher on low carb?\u201d Dozens of ketogenic and paleo forums have discussions on the issue. Some of the information flames fears, using unsubstantiated claims, that a low-carb diet could trigger diabetes rather than reverse it. Ketosis keeps your glucose at a stable steady rate all day via gluconeogenesis. In totally keto-adapted people, their glucose levels can be steadily low (4.5 mMol/L) compared to other people, (5.5 mMol/L) but the body always maintains a safe level so you don't go into a coma. As I've tried to explain (and Ravenrose also explained), the higher fasting number when on a ketogenic diet is a version of the 'dawn phenomenon' that many diabetics experience as the liver tries to keep our blood sugar levels from going too LOW during sleep. Do you know of any data showing high fasting blood sugar in ketogenic dieters? The only published data I am familiar with has shown ~10% lower fasting blood sugar in ketogenic dieters compared to normal dieters. well, as someone else said I'm not an endocrinologist so take this under. that heading.A blood glucose of 90 might be a little high in ketosis but maybe not. Blood glucose doesn't get as low as most people think and the body is really good at keeping blood glucose in the normal range (except for diabetics).

Galactose is classified as a monosaccharide, an aldose, a hexose, and is a reducing sugar. How is alpha glucose different from beta glucose? In alpha glucose the hydroxyl group at carbon one is below the plane of the ring. In beta glucose the hydroxyl group at carbon one is above the plane of the ring. What is the structure of alpha glucose? Glucose is also known as D-glucose, dextrose, or grape sugar is found in plants and it is a byproduct of photosynthesis and fuels for cellular respiration. Glucose is used as energy by living organisms. Galactose is a monosaccharide sugar that is less sweet compared to glucose. It is a C-4 epimer of glucose. Epimers are diastereomers that differ in configuration of only one stereogenic center. Diastereomers are a class of stereoisomers. What type of bond is formed between two sugars in a disaccharide? Show transcribed image text Part A Review Figure 5.2. How do the structures of glucose and galactose differ? Glucose Galactose OH HO OH OH Ho Ho Glucose is an aldose; galactose is a ketose Glucose has more hydrogen and fewer oxygen atoms than galactose. Glucose is a hexose; galactose is a pentose The spatial arrangement of the hydroxyl group on the fourth carbon is different. 100% (1 rating) Glucose is also called blood sugar, as it circulates in the blood, and relies on the enzymes glucokinase or hexokinase to initiate metabolism. Your body processes most carbohydrates you eat into glucose, either to be used immediately for energy or to be stored in muscle cells or the liver as glycogen for later use. Galactose (galacto-+ -ose, milk sugar), sometimes abbreviated Gal, is a monosaccharide sugar that is about as sweet as glucose, and about 30% as sweet as sucrose. It is a C-4 epimer of glucose. How does glucose differ from galactose? In glucose the hydroxyl group at carbon four is below the plane of the ring. In galactose the hydroxyl group at carbon four is above the plane of the ring. Galactose is nearly identical to glucose in structure except for one hydroxyl group on carbon atom number four of the six-sided sugar. Since it differs in only one position about all six asymmetric centers in the linear form of the sugar, galactose is known as an epimer of glucose. they both have their -OH on carbon 4 in different places. up on galactose and down on glucose how is sucrolose made from sucrose by replacing some of the hydroxyl grps iwth chlorine Glucose and galactose are diastereoisomers. The structures of glucose and galactose are Diastereoisomers are Optical isomers of each other. Not mirror images of each other. Not superimposable on each other. Glucose and galactose differ in the configuration at C-4, they are non-superimposable, and they are not mirror images of each other.. They are therefore diastereoisomers. socratic Query: how do the structures of glucose and galactose differ?", "output": "Glucose is an aldose; galactose is a ketose Glucose has more hydrogen and fewer oxygen atoms than galactose.

Anorthosite Fest. Through a Global Forum initiative at Brown University, Professor Lew Ashwal from Witwatersrand University in South Africa visited the Department of Geological Sciences from July 16 to 27th. The overall goal of the Forum was to initiate long-term research links with prominent universities around the globe. Lew is a world expert on terrestrial anorthosite formation and his visit sparked broad interest and support across Brown/MIT NLSI for discussions on the formation of lunar anorthosite. During Lew\u2019s visit, the current knowledge of the origin of both terrestrial and lunar anorthosites was reviewed and interdisciplinary research directions discussed. Anorthosite and labradorescence. Anorthosite is an igneous monomineralic rock that is composed of plagioclase feldspar (over 90% of the rock is composed of this mineral). Plagioclase is a very common mineral group, more than half of the Earth\u2019s crust is composed of it. Anorthosite in many cases is not light-colored at all. This is the result of tiny Fe-Ti oxide inclusions in plagioclase crystals that give them bluish-black hue. One fascinating aspect associated with many anorthosites is an effect called labradorescence. It is a special form of iridescence. of the western body of gabbroic anorthosite (Rose, 1960). The anorthosite probably originally formed by plagioclase floatation in mafic magma chamber at the base of the crust (Ashwal, 1993). The ores for med late during the crystallization of anorthosite by concentration of Fe-Ti oxides (Ashwal, 1993). metamorphism: (1) precipitation of metamorphic zircon from solid state reactions involving breakdown of Zr-bearing phases or (2) precipitation of partial intergranular melt, enriched in zirconium by partial reabsorbion of Lew Ashwal greeting an old friend. Credit: Brown/MIT. Lew\u2019s visit began with two extended lectures by him on terrestrial anorthosites, followed by a three-day field trip to anorthosite regions in the Adirondacks. A few people raised questions about how the new-found H2O in the lunar mantle would change our models of anorthosite formation. Also, the issue of how the very pure anorthosite (with scarce mafic minerals) widely observed across the Moon is formed was also discussed. In comparing the lunar anorthosites to terrestrial examples, it was unclear whether they were analogous to Archean anorthosites, which have similarly high An contents, but are thought to be derived from hydrous magmas. metamorphic zircon for mation in samples studied by Bingen et al. (2000), were not found in the thin sections (see also Davidson and v an Breemen, 1988). In the Ivry deposit, silica activity was high enough along the plagioclase boundaries to form zircon during cooling or metamorphism rather than baddeleyite or srilankite. Metamorphic Zircon in Fe-Ti Ores, Morin Anorthosite Complex (Grenville Province, Quebec) Anorthosite is a plutonic rock just as granite and gabbro and it is usually associated with the latter. Therefore we can conclude that despite being officially leucocratic it actually is usually associated with mafic rocks.

While this is an acceptable classification, strong arguments can be (and have been) made that Modern Art began at a variety of different dates. Depending on which survey course a person takes, Modern Art is said to have begun with either: 1  Romanticism, in the early 1800s, 2  Realism, in the 1830s, 3  Daguerre's announcement, in 1839, that he had invented a method for making a direct positive image, 4  The writer Baudelaire who, in 1846, called upon artists to be of their time, Vector Art \u2013 Roses Illustration in Art Nouveau style. Art Nouveau has seen somewhat of a revival in the last twenty years with the rise of postmodernism design. Artists all over the world use elements of this modern art style as inspiration. Such elements include sinuous lines, floral elements, nature features and the characteristic colors. The history of modern art is also the history of the progressive loss of art's audience. Art has increasingly become the concern of the artist and the bafflement of the public.. Art is a line around your thoughts.. There is no such thing as good painting about nothing.. In the previous posts I started writing about the influence of art history on modern design and I began with the Gothic Style from the Medieval Period, which was followed by the post about the Baroque Style from the Western Art. Today\u2019s post is about another great and influential style, this time from the Modern Art Period: Art Nouveau. If you want to read more about the Modern Art, click here. When and where did the Art Nouveau style appear? Summary: 1  Ancient and modern art refers to two distinct art periods that reflect a particular period of history and human lifestyle. Both art periods have their own characteristics and means of expressing human lifestyle in that period. 2  The period of Ancient art ranges from the Paleolithic period to the Middle Ages. Video art exemplifies this, for the viewer watches the work as it is actually being made; they watch as the process unfolds. Video installation pieces combine video with sound, music, and/or other interactive components. In Nicole Cohen's Please Be Seated, viewers are asked to be active participants. For two decades, French painters and other artists studied the way light changes as you create a landscape or another scene. In Cezanne\u2019s A Modern Olympia (1873-1874), the observer sees another example of how Modern Art abandoned Realism and Naturalism in sketchy borders between forms. Modern Art Timelines give you information about the artists, movements and styles of Modernism from around 1870 to 1975. They help you to understand a century of modern art from Impressionism to Minimalism. They also list the major artists and illustrate a key work from each movement. Definition of Modern Art. Modern art is the creative world's response to the rationalist practices and perspectives of the new lives and ideas provided by the technological advances of the industrial age that caused contemporary society to manifest itself in new ways compared to the past. Here is a short overview of important modern art movements from Impressionism to Op Art. The images on this page are from Wikimedia Commons repository under the GNU Free Documentation License. Impressionism. The history of modern art started with Impressionism. It all began in Paris as a reaction to a very formal and rigid style of painting - done inside studios and set by traditional institutions like the Academie des Beaux-Arts in Paris.

This looks a bit confusing on a map because Upper Egypt is to the south and Lower Egypt is to the north. This is because the names come from the flow of the Nile River. Fertile Land. The most important thing the Nile provided to the Ancient Egyptians was fertile land. Most of Egypt is desert, but along the Nile River the soil is rich and good for growing crops. The three most important crops were wheat, flax, and papyrus. Wheat - Wheat was the main staple food of the Egyptians. They used it to make bread. Fun Facts about the Nile River.
