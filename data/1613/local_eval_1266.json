I hope we can honestly discuss these interests as well. Are you planning to open agressively?', \"Buongiorno!\\n\\nThere's only so aggressive I *can* be, Sultan! I haven't even mentioned the idea of a Lepanto to Austria and I'm principally focused on getting a build in Tunis or Greece this year. Where are you looking at things?\", \"Well, I would strongly encourage you to visit Tunis. In return, I'd be happy to offer you support if sometime in the future you decide the map has too much Austria on it.\", \"Well... Tunis is pretty much guaranteed for me, and it will be there in 1902 if I find juicier fruit in 1901. Are you suggesting I try my luck in Trieste instead, and that you'll be happy to support me the war against Austria that will likely immediately follow? \\n\\nOne of my friends is in another game where his I and a friendly T are advancing well against a chaotic Russia/Austria alliance.\"]", "output": "you had me at \"against Austria\".
