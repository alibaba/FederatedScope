At the age of eleven, he worked in a law office as an office boy where he became interested in reading. He was soon reading the works of famous authors like William Shakespeare and Homer, and was well on his way to becoming one of America's most well-known poets. By the time Whitman was seventeen years old, he had already worked as a printer's learner, a worker, and a learning games to help his students with spelling and maths. In his early twenties, however, he gave up teaching to pursue   a full-time career as a journalist and poet. When Walt Whitman first appeared as a poet, his arrival onto the American literary scene was met with controversy. His first collection of poems, Leaves of Grass, was so unusual that no commercial publisher would print the work. In 1855 Whitman published, at his own expense, the first edition of his collection of twelve poems. Whitman's poetic style was uncommon I the sense that he wrote poems in a form called parallelism  , in which his goal was to copy the flow of the sea and the quickly-passing nature of human emotion. A common theme in Whitman's poetry is self-realization. In his work, Whitman moves from conventional patterns of rhyme to create a unique rhythm and a multi-layered, but truly American voice. \"Although Whitman was considered a revolutionary by many, there is little doubt he loved his country deeply.\" In his writing, he used slang   and various images, or voices, to create a sense of national unity. For Whitman, the \"proof of a poet is that his country absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorbed it.\" Whitman has undoubtedly become a part of the cultural history and image of America. \n Question: When Whitman first appeared as a poet,   _  . \n Options: (A) he received a warm welcome (B) his literary road was not easy (C) he became famous for his unusual style (D) his poetic style was copied by other poets", "output": "B", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

For more than 100 years, libraries have played an important role in keeping America informed and educated. But how are these book-filled buildings changing with the times? You may be surprised to find out. Benjamin Franklin famously founded America's first lending library in 1731 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. And the public library system developed greatly in the late 1800's. Businessman Andrew Carnegie donated millions of dollars to help build free public libraries across the country. Between 1886 and 1919, Carnegie's donations helped build 1,679 new libraries! Carnegie believed in the opportunities that libraries could offer Americans young and old. He knew that the more libraries there were, the more people would have access to books, lectures, news and more. \"There are now more public libraries in the United States than McDonald's restaurants,\" said Clara Hayden, of Baltimore's Enoch Pratt Free Library.  Chances are that there is a public library in or near your community . After all, the United States is home to 9,225 public libraries. Today, libraries continue to develop and grow. Seven out of ten libraries offer free Internet access. This opens any doors for community members who cannot go online at home, including the opportunity to apply for jobs online. Libraries are also teaching kids about the fun of reading. One new program called Read! Play! ----- combines reading with playtime. As kids listen to a book being read aloud, they use Legos to build images from the story. \"Today's libraries are always looking for creative programming to bring people into the library,\" Lego's Michael McNally said. Benjamin Franklin once said, \"The doors of wisdom are never shut.\" As long as the doors of public libraries are open, his statement is most certainly true! \n Question: Clara Hayden would agree that in America   _  . \n Options: (A) you can find public libraries almost everywhere (B) there are too many McDonald's restaurants (C) restaurants are as important as libraries (D) it is convenient to enjoy meals while reading", "output": "A", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

Dustin Bockman of Wisconsin and two hunting friends caught the 727-pound 13-foot-long beast on Sunday, beating last year's record-setter by 26 pounds, according to the state's Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks. \"We're going to cook it for sure.\" he told Gulf Live. \"There's plenty for me and everybody else.\" He and his team of hunters followed the huge creature for 12 hours until they could get close enough to shoot him with a crossbow. \"He would go to the bottom and sit like a piece of wood. You could do anything with him,\" Bockman said. The hunters then had  to figure out how to drag the beast's dead body into their boat.

She was shocked at her gator's size. \"It took about four hours to get it in the boat,\" she said. \"We had to ask another boat to help us out  it was so big.\" She said that she, too, was going to eat the beast and use it for decoration. \"I think my brother-in-law is going to get the head mounted.\" she said.

That's what some fourth-and-fifth-graders at a school in Minnesota discovered earlier this year when they took part in a research project to see if changing their classrooms would make them more active.  Researchers from the Mayo Clinic were concerned about reports that as many as half of American kids could be seriously overweight - or obese - by the year 2014. So they set up a different kind of classroom, which you might see in the future.  Instead of desks, the Elton Hills Elementary students had adjustable work stations where they could stand, kneel on mats or sit on big exercise balls. Students were given laptops and iPods that allowed them to move and learn at the same time.  Sensors   were attached to the kids' legs to calculate how many calories students burned in their new set-up.  Their typical school day was probably not anything like yours. One group of students downloaded an audio file   of their teacher reading a book; they listened to it while walking for exercise. Another group took a spelling test by listening to their iPods.  Some students liked the freedom, but others missed the traditional classroom.  \"I don't like standing up,\" Mariah Matrious said. \"My legs get tired, and I like sitting down. \"  So, did the experiment work? Researchers still are studying the data, but early results indicate that the kids did move around more in the new classroom. \"It showed us that, given the opportunity to move, kids will move,\" said researcher Lorraine Lanningham-Foster.  That's important because studies have shown that even simple movement - climbing stairs instead of taking an elevator , for example, or washing dishes by hand instead of loading the dishwasher - can be as important as formal exercise when it comes to controlling one's weight. \n Question: The school in Minnesota carried out the research   _  . \n Options: (A) to punish the badly performed students (B) to prevent children from being too fat (C) to spare a lot of money for the state (D) to meet the needs of different children", "output": "B", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

There was not enough rain in some parts of the country last year and the bad weather may mean that a gallon   of milk will cost 41 cents more after October 1st. California already has high milk prices and the California court does not want the price to go any higher. High milk prices will be very hard for some people. Families with many children will have to spend more money to buy milk. The poor and older people without much money will also be hurt by higher prices. The court said that more milk from other states should be sold in California as the price of milk from other states is not as high. Some states got enough rain so their costs did not go up. People will then be able to buy the cheaper milk, meaning that unless milk producers bring their milk prices down, their milk will not sell. The drought   around the country has meant market forces are likely to push milk prices up by as much as 41-cent a gallon by October 1st. Experts said this decision by the Californian court could reduce   the effect of the price rise here. The 41-cent increase would add to California's already high milk prices so California must allow more milk producers from outside the state to sell their products there. This would then lead to increased supplies  , which would, as a result, stop milk prices from increasing. \n Question: Who will be hurt by high milk prices? \n Options: (A) Young people.

When the bundle was in her arms and she moved the fold of cloth to look upon his tiny face, she gasped. The doctor turned quickly and looked out of the tall hospital window.

When he rushed home from school one day and threw himself into his mother's arms, she sighed , knowing that his life was to be unfortunate. He cried to his mum \"A boy, a big boy... called me a freak  .\" He grew up, handsome. A favorite with his fellow students, he might have been class president, but for that. He developed a gift, a talent for literature and music. \"But you might communicate with other young people,\" his mother blamed him, but felt a kindness in her heart. Two years went by. One day, his father said to the son, \"You' re going to the hospital, son. Mother and I have someone who will donate the ears you need.

I could never do enough for him or her.\" \"I do not believe you could,\" said the father, \"but the agreement was that you are not to know... not yet.\" The years kept their secret, but the day did come. He stood with his father over his mother' s casket.

Hannah followed my example. \"Good girl. Now what else would you like to touch?\" She stretched her finger toward the lamp. I allowed her to touch everything in sight, plants, glass objects, TV, VCR, speakers, etc. If she started to grab , I gently reminded her to use one finger. She always obeyed. However, Hannah, an only child, possessed a more adventurous personality. Her father predicted it would prevent her from accepting the \"one finger rule\". During their four-day stay, we aided Hannah in remembering \"one finger rule\". She learned quickly.  Months later, my husband and I drove to Salt Lake.

Women became railway conductors, brick layers, and factory workers. Their presence in traditionally male workplace produced many problems. Men were annoyed by women's higher productivity and willingness to work for lower pay. Working mothers were often criticized for leaving their families.

They made uniforms, rolled bandages, and campaigned for the sale of Liberty Bonds to help finance the war. 4American manufacturers offered jobs to large numbers of black Americans for the first time as a result of the war. Most factories were located in the North. To take advantage of these new job opportunities, many black families moved from their homes in the South to the Northern cities such as Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Buffalo, Chicago, and Detroit. 5White Americans were of two minds about the role of black Americans in the war effort. On the one hand, black workers' ability to learn new jobs quickly and do them well strengthened the home front, and the black men's fighting ability helped the Allies win the war.

Although science has made great steps in making food more fit to eat, it has, at the same time, made many foods unfit to eat. Some research has shown that perhaps eighty percent of all human illnesses are related to diet and forty percent of cancer is related to diet as well. Different cultures are subject to certain illnesses because of the food that is characteristic in these cultures. That food is related to illness is not a new discovery. In 1945, government researchers realized that nitrates  and nitrites , commonly used to keep color in meats, and other food additives, caused cancer. Yet, these additives remain in our food, and it becomes more difficult all the time to know which things on the packaging labels  of processed food are helpful or harmful. The additives which we eat are not all so direct. Farmers often give penicillin to cows and chick and because of this, penicillin has been found in the milk of treated cows. Sometimes similar drugs are given to animals not for medicinal purposes, but for financial reasons. The farmers are simply trying to fatten the animals in order to get a higher price on the market. Although the FDA has tried repeatedly to control these, the practices continue. \n Question: How has science done a bad service to mankind? \n Options: (A) Diseases caused by food have been done away with.

A secret research unit \"Mission 523 \"was formed to find a cure for the illness. Two years later, Tu Youyou was instructed to become the new head of \"Mission 523\". \"Mission523\" read ancient books carefully for a long time to find historical methods of fighting malaria. When she started her search for an anti-malarial drug, more than 240,000 compounds  around the world had already been tested, without any success.

The team took out one active compound in wormwood, and then tested it. But nothing was effective until Tu Youyou returned to the original ancient text.

As a young boy, he spent a great deal of time listening to the music of the black Southern church. Coltrane's father sewed clothes and could also play several musical instruments for his own enjoyment. The young Coltrane grew up in such a musical environment. And he discovered jazz by listening to the recordings of such jazz greats as Count Basie and Lester Young. When John was thirteen, he asked his mother to buy him a saxophone. People realized almost immediately that the young man could play the instrument very well. John learned by listening to the recordings of the great jazz saxophone players, Johnny Hodges and Charlie Parker. In 1943 John and his family moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He studied music for a short time at the Granoff Studios and at the Ornstein School of Music. He served for a year in a Navy band in Hawaii. When he returned, he began playing the saxophone in several small bands. In 1948, Coltrane joined trumpet player Dizzy Gillespie's band. Seven years later, Coltrane joined the jazz group of another trumpet player, Miles Davis.Then he began experimenting with new ways to write and perform jazz music, and explored many new ways of playing the saxophone.Some people did not like this new sound, while others said it was an expression of modern soul and represented an important change. By 1965, Coltrane became one of the most famous jazz musicians in the world. He was famous in Europe and Japan, as well as in the United States. He was always trying to produce a sound that no one had produced before. Some of the sounds he made were beautiful. Others were like loud screams. Miles Davis said Coltrane was the loudest, fastest saxophone player that ever rived. Many people could not understand his music. But they listened anyway. Coltrane never made his music simpler to become more popular. He continued to perform and record even as he suffered from liver cancer.

A study of 4,000 dog owners has found a clear link between limited playtime and behaviour problems, such as being nervous when left alone, disobedience and snapping at other animals. And while researchers can't be sure that playing less is directly to blame, they say that games provide vital intellectual stimulation and exercise. The Bristol University study showed that only one in five owners play with their dogs six times a day.  Half play two or three times a day and 10 per cent have just one play session. Mark Evans, former chief vet for the RSPCA, said that dogs are one of the few animals to play into adulthood.  He told the Sunday Times: 'There is a clear association in the results.  Owners report more potential behaviour problems in dogs that play less.' Emily Blackwell -- who conducted the research uncovered tonight on Channel 4's Dogs: Their Secret Lives - said dogs often enjoy playing so much that they slow down or change strategy to make the fun last longer. The lecturer in canine  welfare hopes that 10,000 people will eventually fill out the survey. This will enable her to firmly establish whether lack of play is affecting dogs' moods - or if their emotional problems put their owners off spending time with them.  For instance,they may slow down when playing 'chase', allowing their owner to catch up with them and the game to continue. Favourite games include wrestling, chase and tugging at toys, and perhaps unsurprisingly,'fetch' topped the list. Tennis balls were the favourite toys, followed by soft, squeaky toys, rubber balls and rope toys. The research comes just days after an animal charity warned that millions of dogs are becoming fat. aggressive and destructive because their owners are clueless about basic animal care.The PDSA said that treats including beer, chips and leftover takeaways are making dogs fat and unwell - and wamed that almost a million are never taken for a walk. \n Question: If the dogs are not looked after carefully,  _  . \n Options: (A) they may become rebelling and damaging (B) they may get hurt and run away from home (C) they may become less active and dislike playing with the owners (D) they are more likely to fight with other animals", "output": "A", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

A group of women and men were asked to complete a series of \"everyday challenges\" such as finding restaurants on a map and searching for a lost key in a field. Once again, women outperformed men on the test, particularly in the key-searching task. \"It suggests that- in a stressed and complex situation - women are more able to stop and think about what's going on in front of them,'' researcher Keith Law of the University of Hertfordshire, UK, told the BBC,[ln contrast,] men had a slight impulsiveness ;they jumped in too quickly\" But where did women get the ability to keep organized under pressure? Researchers believe that it has its roots in evolution ,In early human communities, women had to keep an eye on children while cooking meals. Meanwhile, men only needed to focus on hunting. Men might not be happy about this study. After all, many great pilots are men and they have to deal with lots of information at the same time too.

It's because they're smart. \"Fish are sensitive, they have personalities,\" says the marine biologist.

They can remember things and learn from experience. Earle and a growing number of animal rights activists see these as strong arguments against eating fish altogether. The activists also point out that fish feel pain and fish suffer horribly on their way from the sea to the supermarket. \"While it may seem _ that fish are able to feel pain, like every other animal, some people think of fish as swimming vegetables,\" says Dr. Lynne Sneddon. \"Really, it's kind of a moral question.

Psychologists at Yale and the University of California, San Diego studying the unconscious influence of names say a preference for our own names and initials -- the \"name-letter effect\" -- can have some negative consequences. Students whose names begin with C or D get lower grades than those whose names begin with A or B; major league baseball players whose first or last names began with K (the strikeout-signifying letter) are significantly more likely tostrike out. Assistant professors Leif Nelson of UCSD and Joseph Simmons of Yale have conducted five studies over five years using information from thousands of individuals. \"The conscious process is baseball players want to get a hit and students want to get A's,\" Nelson says. \"So if you get a change in performance consistent with the name-letter effect, it clearly shows there must be some unconscious desire operating in the other direction.\" The researchers' work supports a series of studies published since 2002 that have found the \"name-letter effect\" causes people to make life choices based on names that resemble their own. Those studies by Brett Pelham, an associate professor at SUNY University, have found that people aredisproportionately likely to live in states or cities resembling their names, have careers that resemble their names and even marry those whose surnames begin with the same letter as their own. The _ , Pelham says, is that he has believed the name-letter effect would apply only to positive outcomes.

A recent story from The Wall Street Journal reported on a book club in Wellington, New Zealand, where members meet in a cafe and turn off their smartphones.They sink into cozy chairs and read in silence for an hour. Unlike traditional book clubs, the point of the slow reading club isn't exchanging ideas about a certain book, but to get away from electronic devices and read in a quiet, relaxed environment. According to the Journal, the Wellington book club is just one example of a movement started by book lovers who miss the old-fashioned way of reading before the Internet and smartphones. Slow readers, such as The Atlantic's Maura Kelly, say a regular reading habit sharpens the mind, improves concentration, reduces stress levels and deepens the ability to sympathize. Another study published last year in Science showed that reading novels helps people understand other's mental states and beliefs, a fundamental skill in building relationships. Yet technology has made us less attentive readers. Screens have changed our reading patterns from the straight and information.left-to-right sequence to a wild skimming and skipping pattern as we hunt for important words and information. Reading text punctuated with links leads to weaker comprehension than reading plain text. The Internet may have made us stupider, says Patrick Kingsley from The Guardian. Because of the Internet, he says, we have become very good at collecting a wide range of interesting news, but we are also gradually forgetting how to sit back, reflect, and relate all these facts to each other. Slow reading means a return to an uninterrupted, straight pattern, in a quiet environment free of distractions. Aim for 30 minutes a day, advises Kelly from The Atlantic. \"You can squeeze in that half hour pretty easily if only during your free moments, you pick up a meaningful work of literature,\" Kelly said. \"Reach for your e-reader, if you like. Kindles make books like War and Peace less heavy, not less substantive, and also ensure you'll never lose your place.\" \n Question: According to Patrick Kingsley, people are stupider partly because of  _  . \n Options: (A) a non-stop reading pattern (B) the straight, left-to-right screen (C) a wide range of interesting news (D) the lack of reflection", "output": "D", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

The quake, which struck about 15km (10 miles) south-west of the capital, Port-au-Prince, was quickly followed by two strong aftershocks. In the space of a minute, numerous buildings fell down. A five-story U.N. building was also brought down by the 7.3 magnitude quake, the most powerful to hit Haiti in more than 200 years according to the U.S. Geological Survey. As night fell, the whole city is in total darkness. You can see thousands of people sitting in the streets with nowhere to go. There are people running, crying, screaming. Describing the earthquake as a \"catastrophe\", Haiti's president said the cost of the damage could run into billions. Haiti became the first independent Caribbean state in the early 19th century. Haiti's location, history and attracting climate once made it a tourist hot place. However, decades of poverty, environmental pollution and violence have left it as the poorest nation in the Americas.

The 18-year-old star with some other surfers sailed out to reach the dolphins in order to stop them from being driven into a nearby pool and killed, but the six surfers, from Australia and the United States, were stopped by a fishing boat before they could reach them. The fishermen blocked their way with a boathook  . It was an ugly, unfriendly and life-threatening struggle before the surfers were forced to return to the beach. It is believed that the dolphins were later taken into a pool and killed. Panettiere, who is a brave surfer and loyal animal protector, made up her mind to save the dolphins of Japan and said, \"It was really frightening. Some of us were hit by the boathook, but in the end all we were really worried about the dolphins. It was so sad. We were so close to them and they were jumping out of the water to see us.\" Breaking down in tears, she added, \"One little baby dolphin stuck his head out and looked at me and the thought that it's no longer with us is really hard to take.\" The surfers left the country to avoid arrest   by the Japanese police.

You don't need to care about those people who have beautiful houses with large gardens and swimming pools or those who have nice cars and a lot of money and so on. Why? Because those who have big houses may often feel lonely and those who have cars may want to walk on the country roads at their free time. In fact, happiness is always around you if you put your heart into it. When you are in trouble at school, your friends will help you; when you study hard at your lessons, your parents are always taking good care of your life and your health; when you get success, your friends will say congratulations to you; when you do something wrong, people around you will help you to correct it. And when you do something good to others, you will feel happy, too. All these are your happiness. If you notice a bit of them, you can see that happiness is always around you. Happiness is not the same as money. It is a feeling of your heart. When you are poor, you can also say you are very happy, because you have something else that can't be bought with money. When you meet with difficulties, you can say loudly you are very happy, because you have more chances to challenge yourself. So you cannot always say you are poor and you have bad luck.

I'm so glad that day is over. I was so worried all summer that my first day at my new school would be terrible.  I'm really tired, but my first day at school went well and I feel much better now. First of all, we had to meet outside the school building. I was very nervous because my primary school only had 300 pupils but in the secondary school there are about 1,300. What a difference! The older pupils are really big. I felt so small waiting there in front of the school. The other problem was that I didn't know anyone. My family moved over the summer holidays, because of Dad's new job. So now I have to try to make some new friends. Standing in front of the school this morning, I wanted to be back at my old school with my old friends. The head teacher came out and told us to go into the school hall. Then he called our names out to tell us which class we were in. My class teacher is called Mrs. Black. She took us to our classroom. It's on the 5th floor and ... guess what? ... We aren't allowed to use the lift. I couldn't believe it. When we were walking up all the stairs I started talking to another boy who didn't know anyone. He said his family had moved from Hong Kong over the summer. He seemed really nice so we sat together when we got to our classroom, out of breath! He said his English was very poor but I thought it was really good. We spent all morning with Mrs. Black looking at our timetables. Everyone in the school has a different timetable--can you believe it? Half of the school is learning Spanish as a second language and the other half learns French. I'm in the Spanish group, which sounds like fun. I'm worried that I'll forget my timetable and go to the wrong room! How will anyone help me if nobody else has the same timetable as me? Lunchtime was OK. After lunch we started lessons. I had maths, which was complicated and difficult and then history, where we started to learn about ancient Greece. That looks interesting. I have to do some homework tonight to find out how the ancient Greek people lived. So far so good. I'm quite looking forward to tomorrow, even though I've got science.

The short flight from London to Amsterdam used a blend of 20% babassu  oil mixed with 80% conventional jet fuel. What was really exciting about the flight was the fact that the engine did not have to be altered in any way for the biofuel to work While this is a great initial step in trying to reduce CO2(carbon-dioxide)emissions from airplanes. there are a lot of hurdles  that still need to be overcome. First and foremost, unlike the normal fuel used to run airplanes (known as Jet A),biofuel freezes at high altitudes. Also, Jet'A'fuel burns consistently (at the same pace),which means it provides a safe and reliable fuel for long flights--engineers are not sure if biofuel will be able to do the same. The biggest hurdle to a full biofuel switch is our ability to be able to grow enough crops that can be converted to biofuel. There are two concerns that scientists have in this matter - the first is that the land to grow the extra crops will come from clearing more of our forests and the second is that since it competes with what we eat, the price of food will go up. However, Richard Branson of Virgin Airlines, envisions that if biofuel starts to replace oil on a greater basis, it will be manufactured from algae produced in sewage treatment plants, not from food sources. Birgin Airlines is not the only one trying to look for alternative fuel sources. Earlier this year, an Airbus A380 used another alternative fuel-a man-made mix of gas-to-liquid, in one of its four engines. The flight was tested by Rolls Royce (manufacturer of jet engines), in partnership with Shell (an oil company). Rolls Royce is also working with Air New Zealand on a similar project. While a complete switch to alternative fuel may take years, it is very encouraging to see airlines, oil companies and airplane manufacturers all coming together to try to make it happen! \n Question: .Why does Virgin Airlines try to replace normal fuel with biofuel? \n Options: (A) To cut down the flight cost of the company.

Even if you've only eaten half that much, you have to admit this: you've let some of that breakfast, lunch or dinner go to waste. And it turns out that we're all to blame for this shaming fact: 30% of all food produced in the world each year is wasted or lost. That's about 1.3 billion tons, according to a new report by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. That's the weight of more than 8.6 million full-grown blue whales, the largest creatures on earth. That's the weight of more than 2.3 million Airbus A380s, the largest planes in existence. That's as if each person in China, the world's most populous country with more than 1.3 billion people, had one ton mass of food they could just throw into the dustbin. It's almost  _ ,isn't it? Setting aside that big number, we find the people with the most money are the ones who waste the most. Per capita(  ), European and North American countries waste between 95 and 115 kilograms of food. Sub-Saharan African, South Asian and Southeast Asian countries waste much less -- between 6 and 11 kilograms per person. Here's another statistic: all the food that the world's richest countries waste is about equal to all the food that sub-Saharan Africa produces. The numbers: 222 million tons and 230 million tons, respectively( ). Basically, the wasted food of the rich could feed much of the African continent. And these numbers come as we've just been reporting about rising food prices around the world in the past week. And my own personal tip: if I eat at a restaurant and can't finish it all, I ask for a doggie bag. I used to be a waiter years ago and will never forget the amounts of food I saw left on the table after the bill was paid. There's no reason to waste food.

Unseasonably warm temperatures with very little wind across northeastern China coincided with the smoke from local farmers' burning straws and the start-up of Harbin's coal-powered central heating system. Record densities of fine particulates were measured in the city. In Harbin, the levels of PM2.5 (particulate matter) rise to 1,000 micrograms per cubic meter, worse than Beijing's historic highs. Visibility was reduced to below 50m in parts of Harbin, and below 500m in most of the neighbouring Jilin Province. On Fa Yuen Street in Harbin, visibility of less than 5m was reported. The smog reduced after October 23, 2013 and completely broke up on October 28, 2013 by the first local snow and icy rain due to a cold front moving in from Russia. Harbin lies in the north of China where winter temperatures can drop to -40degC, demanding a six-month heating season. Daily particulate levels of more than 40 times the World Health Organization recommended maximum level were reported in parts of Harbin. The smog remained till 23 October, when almost all monitoring stations in Heilongjiang, Jilin,and Liaoning Provincesreported readings above 200mg/m3forPM2.5. PM2.5 is the amount of particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter in the air, with the WHO recommending a maximum 24-hour mean   of 25 micrograms per cubic meter (mg/m3). On the morning of 25 October, PM2.5 measurements in Harbin had fallen to an average of 123mg/m3. All highways in the surrounding Heilongjiang Province were closed. In Harbin, all primary and middle schools were closed for three days and authorities stopped flights at the airports. Hospitals reported a 23 percent increase in admissions for breathing problems. However, this smog will have no influence on Harbin Ice Festival events later in December 2013. Air pollution in Chinese cities is of increasing concern to China's leadership. Particulates in the air can affect human health and also have influences on climate and rainfall. Pollution from the burning of coal has reduced life expectancy by 5.5 years in the north of China, as a result of heart and lung diseases. \n Question: One cause of the heavy smog in the northeastern Chinese cities may be   _  . \n Options: (A) the lasting cold weather (B) farmers' burning of forests (C) too much strong wind (D) the start-up of heating system", "output": "D", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

And she used every opportunity during her visit to repeat this message. But, back in London, her views were not shared by some members of the British government, which refused to support a ban on these weapons. Angry politicians launched an attack on the Princess in the press. They described her as \"very ill-informed\" and a \"loose cannon\" . The Princess responded by brushing aside the criticisms: \"This is a distraction , we do not need. All I'm trying to do is help.\" Opposition parties, the media and the public immediately voiced their support for the Princess. To make matters worse for the government, it soon emerged that the Princess's trip had been approved by the Foreign Office, and that she was in fact very well-informed about both the situation in Angola and the British government's policy regarding landmines. The result was a severe embarrassment for the government. To try and limit the damage, the Foreign Secretary, Malcolm Rifkidnd, claimed that the Princess's views on landmines were not very different from government policy, and that it was \"working towards\" a worldwide ban. The Defense Secretary, Michael Portillo, claimed the matter was \"a misinterpretation or misunderstanding.\" For the Princess, the trip to this war-torn country was an excellent opportunity to use her popularity to show the world how much destruction and suffering landmines can cause. She said that the experience had also given her the chance to get closer to people an their problems. \n Question: Princess Diana paid a visit to Angola in 1997 \n Options: (A) to clarify the British government's stand on landmines (B) to establish her image as a friend of landmine victims (C) to investigate the sufferings of landmine victims there (D) to voice her support for a total ban of landmines", "output": "D", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

Perhaps the drink is not so bad after all. The new study, conducted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), has been published and suggests that coffee does not have a harmful effect on your health. Researchers suggest, based on data examined, older adults who drink a lot of coffee, have a lower risk of death when compared to their non-drinking coffee peers. The team of researchers conducting the study analyzed data on 400,000 U. S. men and women,aged 50 to 71 years; the individuals had participated in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. This study started in 1995-1996 and was tracked until the day a participant passed away, or Dec. 31, 2008. According to a press release on the report, researchers shared that coffee drinkers are \"less likely to die from heart disease, respiratory disease, stroke, injuries and accidents, diabetes, and infections, although the relationship was not seen for cancer.\" Results indicated participants that drank three or more cups of coffee a day reduced their risk of death by 10 percent. Based on the findings that both caffeinated and non-caffeinated coffee found similar results, researchers are thinking caffeine is not the protective ingredient , although which ingredient in coffee might be, they are not sure. Researchers indicate that despite these observational findings, they caution  it is not clear whether or not drinking coffee actually extends life expectancy. \"Coffee is one of the most widely drunk drinks in America, but the relationship between coffee consumption and risk of death has been unclear. We found coffee consumption to be associated with lower risk of death overall, and of death from a number of different causes,\" said Neal Freedman, Ph.

In fact, writers responded to the railroads as soon as the first were built in the 1830's. By the 1850's, the railroad was a major presence in the life of the nation. Writers such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David saw the railroad both as a boon  to democracy  and as an object of suspicion. The railroad could be and was a despoiler  of nature, furthermore, in its manifestation of speed and noise. _ might be a despoiler of human nature as well. By the 1850's and 1860's, there was a great distrust among writer and intellectuals of the rapid industrialization of which the railroad was a leading force. Deeply philosophical historians such as Henry Adams lamented the role that the new frenzy for business was playing in eroding traditional values. A distrust of industry and business continued among writers throughout the rest of the nineteenth century and into the twentieth. For the most part, the literature in which the railroad plays and important role belong to popular culture rather than to the realm of serious art. One thinks of melodramas, boys' books, thrillers, romances, and the like rather than novels of the _ . In the railroads' prime years, between 1890 and 1920, there were a few individuals in the United States, most of them with solid railroading experience behind them, who made a profession of writing about railroading--works offering the ambience of stations, yards, and locomotive cabs. These writers, who can genuinely be said to have created a genre, the \"railroad novel\", are now mostly forgotten, their names having faded from memory.

However, as the pattern of having two children in a family is challenged by modern family units, there are a few reasons why it is not selfish to want only one child.  Today, the role of women has changed a lot. But nowadays, a wife has to help her husband earn the bread and butter as well as well as looking after her family. In demanding times like these, a woman has to put in more physical and emotional effort than any other member of the family.  Raising a child comes at a cost that remains only heard of, until you find yourself paying it. The good reality of double income with no kids suddenly comes crashing down when there is a child involved in the picture. When one parent (the mother) needs to take some time off to look after the newborn, only one person becomes the earning member. Of course, the expenses went up rapidly. According to Susan Newman, PhD, a social psychologist, the average cost of raising a child is $227,000 from birth to college. Most young mothers also think that having one child would mean that there is more income for the child, and thus, better facilities can be provided. It is much easier to educate a single child at a good school, and give him/her better life with more resources at hand.  With several children in the house, it becomes increasingly difficult to find ways to spend time with all of them. Dividing your time with just one child means that you can devote a little more time to doing the things you want to. In a single child unit, there are less comparison and more chances for positive motivation to learn new things. A happy child, who deserves the rightful attention, love, care, and time from both the parents, always gets a meaningful childhood, for both the parents and the child. \n Question: What does the writer mainly want to tell us in the passage? \n Options: (A) It is not selfish to have only one child in a family.

Apple has cleverly taken advantage of the power of the letter \"i\" -- and many other brands are following suit. The BBC's iPlayer -- which allows Web users to watch TV programs on the Internet -- adopted the title in 2008. A lovely bear -- popular in the US and UK -- that plays music and video is called \"iTeddy\". A slimmed-down version of London's Independent newspaper was launched last week under the name \"i\". In general, single-letter prefixes have been popular since the 1990s, when terms such as e-mail and e-commerce first came into use. Most \"i\" products are targeted at young people and considering the major readers of Independent's \"i\", it's no surprise that they've selected this fashionable name. But it's hard to see what's so special about the letter \"i\". Why not use \"a\", \"b\", or \"c\" instead? According to Tony Thorne, head of the Language Center at King's College, London, \"i\" works because its meaning has become ambiguous. When Apple uses \"i\", no one knows whether it means Internet, information, individual or interactive, Thorne told BBC Magazines. \"Even when Apple created the iPod, it seems it didn't have one clear definition,\" he says. \"However, thanks to Apple, the term is now associated with portability   .\"adds Thorne.
