REUTERS/Andrew Winning He may be in for worse than a surprise: a nasty skin reaction that one doctor is calling \u201cMexican beer dermatitis.\u201d   A substance in lime juice, if left on the skin in the sun, can cause the skin to become discolored, as if by poison ivy or a jellyfish sting \u2014 and the marks can last for months, reports Scott Flugman in the Archives of Dermatology. Mexican beers, particularly Corona, are typically served with a lime slice wedged in the top of the bottle. The drinker shoves the lime into the bottle and holds his or her thumb over the bottle\u2019s mouth while turning the bottle over to mix in the juice. But if the drinker is not careful, the beer\u2019s carbonation can spray lime juice and beer all over his or her skin \u2014 \u201cespecially in a patient who is shirtless by a beach or pool,\u201d wrote Flugman, a dermatologist in New York. The resulting reaction is due to a substance called psoralen, used to make the skin more sensitive to a wavelength of ultraviolet light, UV-A, used to treat certain skin conditions. Lemons contain psoralens too, but not as strong. \u201cIt\u2019s just a cosmetic issue,\u201d Flugman told Reuters Health, though he said the discoloration \u2014 most frequently in people like bartenders who work outdoors with limes \u2014 may take an emotional toll. \u201cPeople are worried that it\u2019s something serious. You might have some brown spots you\u2019re been looking at for a few months,\u201d he said. Olive-skinned Caucasians may be especially susceptible.

REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader The global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol was adopted by consensus at the annual assembly of the World Health Organization (WHO). Its 10 main policy recommendations, drawn up after two years of negotiation, are not binding but serve as guidance to WHO\u2019s 193 member states. \u201cAlcohol contributes to accidents, mental health problems, social problems and harms third parties,\u201d said Bernt Bull, a senior advisor in Norway\u2019s health ministry. Nordic countries, many of which already have tight restrictions on alcohol sales, spearheaded the initiative at the United Nations agency. A relatively high excise tax on alcoholic beverages and regulations limiting their availability was helping to reduce alcohol-related diseases in Norway, he said. The WHO estimates that risks linked to alcohol cause 2.5 million deaths a year from heart and liver disease, road accidents, suicides and various cancers \u2014 3.8 percent of all deaths. It is the third leading risk factor for premature deaths and disabilities worldwide. \u201cAlcohol is usually not perceived as a killer, though it is,\u201d Shekhar Saxena, director of WHO\u2019s department of mental health and substance abuse, told a news briefing. Despite growing abuse and youth drinking at an earlier age in many countries, half of WHO members do not have a national alcohol policy, according to WHO expert Vladimir Poznyak. \u201cThe biggest changes might happen in those countries which have no alcohol control institutions or regulatory framework for alcohol consumption,\u201d he told reporters. SELF-REGULATION   The Global Alcohol Producers Group noted the strategy recognized the importance of self-regulation by industry in helping to address alcohol abuse. Its members recognized \u201cthe harmful effects of irresponsible drinking patterns\u201d and would continue efforts to promote self-regulation of advertising as well as curbs on drink driving and illegal underage and excessive drinking, a statement said. Britain\u2019s Diageo, the world\u2019s largest alcoholic drinks group, and Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world\u2019s largest brewer and maker of Budweiser, are among its members. In a separate statement, brewing giant SABMiller gave a cautious welcome to the plan, but warned:   \u201cSABMiller is unconvinced there is sufficient evidence to support policy options such as minimum pricing and high excise taxes that may result in unintended, negative public health consequences which stem from the growth of the illicit alcohol market.\u201d   The WTO strategy document says the harmful use of alcohol has a serious effect on public health and is one of the main risk factors for poor health globally. There is strong evidence that a low limit for blood alcohol concentration (0.02 to 0.05 percent) is effective in reducing drink-driving casualties, it says. It underlined the importance of a legal framework for restricting the sale and serving of alcohol, a minimum age for buying drinks and \u201cmandated health warnings\u201d on alcohol labels. Setting a minimum price per unit gram of alcohol has been shown to reduce consumption and alcohol-related harm, it said. But overly tight restrictions on alcohol availability may promote the development of a parallel illicit market, it warned.

Sylvester Graham (1794-1851) believed physical lust was harmful to the body and caused such dire maladies in the sexually overheated as pulmonary consumption, spinal diseases, epilepsy, and insanity, as well as such lesser ailments as headaches and indigestion. He also thought too much lust could result in the early death of offspring, who would have been conceived from weakened stock. Graham believed a strict vegetarian diet would aid in suppressing carnal urges; to this end, he advocated a regimen devoid of meat and rich in fiber as a way of combating rampant desire. His famed \u201cGraham bread\u201d was fashioned from the coarsely ground wheat flour he espoused and which came to bear his name:  The Reverend Sylvester Graham, an eccentric Presbyterian minister from Connecticut, promoted a strict, abstemious diet that won him countless converts during America\u2019s health craze of the 1820s and 1830s. Convinced that eating meat and fat leads to sinful sexual excess, the good reverend urged total vegetarianism. He also warned that mustard and ketchup cause insanity, urged followers to drink only water, and recommended sleeping with one\u2019s windows open regardless of the weather. More reasonably, he touted the merits of a high-fiber diet and promoted the use of homemade unsifted wheat flour instead of refined white flour.1  Although Graham had his adherents during his lifetime, he was mostly regarded as a bit of a nut. Still, there were those who followed his recommendations and happily incarcerated themselves in \u201cGraham boarding houses\u201d in New York and Boston as part of the health craze he inspired. A high-fiber vegetarian diet wasn\u2019t the only thing he pushed: Graham was also strongly against the use of tobacco or alcohol and advocated fresh air, exercise, and a good night\u2019s sleep as excellent components of a healthy lifestyle. Who actually produced the first \u2018graham crackers\u2019 \u2014 so named because they were made of the unsifted wheat flour that Sylvester Graham promoted \u2014 is the subject of dispute. Some sources assert Graham himself invented the snack in 1829; others claim the graham cracker did not come into being until 1882, 31 years after Graham\u2019s death. (The latter date appears to be based on the year recipes for graham crackers started appearing in cookbooks.) Many bakers tried to market the crackers, but it wasn\u2019t until 1898 that the National Biscuit Company (now Nabisco) made any real inroads into the market with their Nabisco Graham Crackers product. Nabisco achieved even greater success with their Honey Maid line, introduced in 1925, which boosted the original graham flavor through the addition of honey.", "output": "Graham crackers were named for a man who believed unhealthy diet led to sexual excess.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "The suspension of aid work came after unknown assailants fired rocket-propelled grenades at three aid organizations in the southwestern province of Dhale over the weekend, according to the U.N.

Months later, a Saudi-led coalition intervened to fight the Iran-backed Houthis and restore the government.

The painful disease has re-emerged due to the deterioration of Yemen\u2019s health and sanitation systems.

Millions more could potentially watch in real time as the eclipse is captured by video cameras mounted on 50 high-altitude balloons and streamed online in a joint project between NASA and Montana State University.

Adding further to the excitement is the wide availability of affordable solar-safe sunglasses produced by the millions and selling so fast that suppliers were running out of stock.

Electric irons, dishwashers, vacuum cleaners, gas (or electric) stoves and ovens, washing machines, and clothes dryers are but a few of the many labor-saving devices so familiar to many of us that we seldom ponder just how they work. Ask the average person, for example, how a clothes dryer works, and you\u2019ll probably get an \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d look in return, along with a terse explanation that a dryer makes stuff \u201chot,\u201d and everybody knows stuff dries faster when it\u2019s hot. That explanation isn\u2019t technically wrong (as far as it goes), but it\u2019s overly simple. Knowing a bit more about the process involved is the key to understanding why the advice to keep your dryer\u2019s lint filter clean can help improve the performance of your clothes dryer. In a standard (gas) dryer, a fan pulls fresh air into the dryer and sends it flowing over a gas burner. The burner heats the air, which is then channeled into a tumbling drum where the wet clothes are held. The heat, air flow, and tumbling motion all contribute to evaporating the moisture held in the fabrics, and that moisture is absorbed by the gas-warmed air. (Warm air is capable of holding more moisture than cold air.) The warm air \u2014 and the moisture it now holds \u2014 passes through a filter to trap lint and other particulate matter stirred up by its movement and is vented to the outside so that it can be replaced with new, less-moist air. This process repeats until enough moisture has been evaporated and carried away for the clothes to be considered sufficiently \u201cdry.\u201d Of course, if you neglect to clean the lint filter between dryings, or something else occludes the filter, moist air cannot be vented from the dryer as easily. The result will be that your dryer will work less efficiently: you will have to run your dryer longer to dry a load of clothes, which means higher electricity and gas charges for you and a potentially shorter lifespan for your dryer:  I had a wonderful morning, the heating unit went out of my dryer! Why does everything seem to fall apart this time of year!??? The guy that fixes things went in to the dryer and pulled out the lint filter. It was clean. We always clean the lint from the filter after every load of clothes. He told us that he wanted to show him something. He took the filter over to the sink and ran hot water over it. Now, this thing is like a mesh \u2014 I\u2019m sure you know what your dryer\u2019s lint filter looks like \u2014 WELL \u2026 the hot water just laid on top of the mesh!!! It didn\u2019t go through it at all!!! He told us that dryer sheets cause a film over that mesh and that\u2019s what burns out the heating unit. You can\u2019t SEE the film, but it\u2019s there. He said this is also what causes dryer units to catch fire and potentially burn the house down with it! He said the best way to keep your dryer working for a very long time (and to keep your electric bill lower) is to take that filter out and wash it with hot soapy water and an old toothbrush (or other brush) at least every six months. He said that makes the life of the dryer at least twice as long! How about that? Learn something new everyday! I certainly didn\u2019t know dryer sheets would do that. So, thought I\u2019d share! Note: I went to dryer and tested my screen by running water on it. The water collected a little but ran though the screen. I dried it off and was ready to put it back in the dryer since the water ran through it but, I thought was the heck it won\u2019t hurt to wash it while I had it out. Warm soap water and a nylon brush and I had it done in 30 seconds. I then ran the water over the screen and what a difference the water just gushed through it with no puddling at all and this time I was running the water at a faster rate. That repairman knew what he was talking about. So, keeping the lint filter clean is one simple way to increase the efficiency  (and decrease the operating costs) of your dryer. Just removing the lint from the filter isn\u2019t always enough:  the fine mesh of most dryer filters can be clogged in ways that aren\u2019t obvious at a casual glance. As suggested by the piece quoted above, softener sheets can cause waxy build-ups on lint screens that require a little extra effort (usually no more than a quick scrub and rinse in warm, soapy water) to remove. Many modern dryers also use moisture sensors rather than ordinary timed cycles, and residue from dryer sheets can coat the sensors and interfere with their ability to function properly. Cleaning the sensor screen with a little detergent and a soft brush, and wiping off the sensor itself with a cotton ball and some rubbing alcohol can rectify this problem. Although regular cleaning of the lint trap may help your dryer to work more efficiently, it\u2019s unlikely that the lack of such cleaning will result in your dryer\u2019s motor burning out or, worse, catching on fire and burning your house down. Consumer Reports noted of this claim that:  At Consumer Reports we\u2019ve tested hundreds of clothes dryers for our ongoing dryer Ratings and recommendations. CR\u2019s appliance director, Mark Connelly, says it\u2019s possible that over a long period, fabric sheets, fabric softeners, and laundry detergent ingredients contribute to an unseen film or waxy buildup on the dryer lint screen. But \u201cit\u2019s highly doubtful,\u201d he said, \u201cthat any such invisible buildup alone leads to heating-unit burnout or a fire.\u201d", "output": "Washing the lint filter in your clothes dryer can help enhance the performance and lifespan of that appliance and avoid fires.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "The World Organization for Animal Health said routine surveillance testing confirmed on Monday the presence of a low-pathogenic N5N2 virus in a flock of 40,000 turkeys in Kandiyohi County, Minnesota\u2019s top turkey producing county.

Voss said this was the first detection of any avian influenza virus in commercial poultry in Minnesota since that outbreak, although there was a low-pathogenic case in western Wisconsin last year. The 2015 outbreak led to tighter biosecurity measures on poultry farms to protect them from outside sources of infection, such as wild birds, rodents and farm workers who might track in viruses on their footwear or clothing.

We stand by the safety of our product,\u201d J&J said in a statement. The company did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment on the FDA standing by its test result.

At one point during the Aug. 20, 2014 interview, Flynn told host Kathleen Dunn \"\"there are many reasons why (police) uses of force are dramatically down, and the main one is training.\"\" Then, alluding back to Ferguson, the chief added: \"\"It's an extraordinarily rare event. But the fact is, (in) 2012, there were 12,197,000 arrests in the United States, OK? And there were 410 uses of deadly force. Now that is, I think, three-thousands of a percent. So, it\u2019s still an extraordinarily rare event.\"\" In the comparison Flynn uses, there is one police killing in 0.00003 percent of all arrests -- an even tinier fraction than he suggested. But expressed another way, the 410 is an average of more than one police killing per day. So, what about the two figures themselves: Are they accurate and do they account for all of the people who are killed by police? Renewed focus Around the country, attention to the use of deadly force by police was heightened after Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, was shot to death on Aug. 9, 2014, in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb. In Milwaukee, residents held rallies to raise questions about the Brown case and about the April 2014 death of Dontre Hamilton, a 31-year-old who was shot multiple times by a police officer during a struggle in Red Arrow Park in downtown Milwaukee. (In Milwaukee, there was one police killing of a citizen in 2012, four in 2013 and two through late August of 2014, the Police Department told us.) PolitiFact National rated Half True a claim by conservative talk show host Michael Medved that \"\"more whites than blacks are victims of deadly police shootings.\"\" The claim ignored the fact that there are more than five times more whites than blacks in America. And our colleagues rated as False a statement that an unarmed black person is shot by a police officer every 28 hours. The report that had been cited by CNN pundit Marc Lamont Hill looked at all deaths, not just those of unarmed individuals. And it rolled in some deaths that did not involve police officers. Flynn\u2019s claim Flynn, who headed the police departments in Arlington, Va., and Springfield, Mass., before becoming Milwaukee\u2019s chief in 2008, is known nationally for his use of data. When we asked for evidence for Flynn\u2019s claim, a Milwaukee police spokesman cited two FBI reports. Both are from 2012, the most recent full-year statistics available. There were 12,196,959 arrests across the country in 2012, which means the figure Flynn used -- 12,197,000 -- was rounded up only slightly. The highest numbers of those arrests were for drug abuse violations, driving under the influence and larceny-theft. There were also 410 cases of justifiable homicide in 2012, according to the FBI, which defines justifiable homicide as the killing of a felon by a law enforcement officer in the line of duty. For example: A police officer responding to a bank robbery alarm who shot a suspect after the suspect fired at the officer. But that doesn\u2019t taken into account all police killings of citizens. FiveThirtyEight.com, a news website devoted to data analysis, recently reported that the 410 is a minimum figure. The numbers are self-reported by local police agencies and not audited, not all police agencies report those figures to the FBI and the number doesn\u2019t include homicides that weren\u2019t ruled justifiable. The FBI totals are likely an undercount for another reason, criminologists told us. Researchers who examine police killings of citizens within large metropolitan police departments often find that the number of such incidents recorded by the departments are higher than the number of justifiable homicides reported by the FBI. But the criminologists also noted Flynn\u2019s comparison is one legitimate way to measure the frequency of police killings. Our rating Flynn said that in 2012, there were nearly 12.2 million arrests and \"\"410 uses of deadly force\"\" by police in the United States. The Milwaukee police chief correctly quotes official FBI statistics on arrests and justifiable homicides by law enforcement officers, although it appears the 410 is an undercount of the number of people killed by police.

At a high school in North Dakota, a $5,000 grant from a dairy group helped pay for an espresso machine that makes lattes with about 8 ounces of milk each. The drinks used 530 gallons of milk this year. \u201cWe buy a lot of milk,\u201d said Lynelle Johnson, the food service director for the Williston Public School District. It\u2019s not clear how much coffee drinks in high schools might help boost milk consumption, or whether the concept will gain traction across the country. But with consumption of milk in the U.S. down 40 percent since 1975, the dairy industry is looking for all the help it can get. The industry famous for its \u201cGot Milk\u201d advertising campaign is hoping its newer \u201cUndeniably Dairy\u201d slogan will help fend off the almond, oat and soy alternatives that are becoming more popular. And regional dairy groups are encouraging schools to serve milky drinks like smoothies and hot chocolate, as well as iced lattes. The efforts come as the dairy industry is also trying to adjust to changing views about diet and nutrition. With fat no longer seen as a dietary evil, skim milk has suffered the sharpest declines in demand in recent years. And it\u2019s difficult for dairy producers to reduce production of skim milk because it is left over after making other products such as butter, cheese and ice cream. As skim milk becomes especially tough to sell, Organic Valley is even drying some of the surplus and mixing it back into low-fat and fat-free milk to boost the nutrients and make it creamier. \u201cWe\u2019re just exploring everything we can,\u201d said George Siemon, who was CEO of Organic Valley when the plans were developed, but has recently stepped down. The dairy industry blames rules that limit the fat content of milk in schools for consumption declines, arguing that generations of students are growing up disliking milk because of the watery taste of skim. In the meantime, it\u2019s hoping lattes can make milk go down easier. In Florida, a dairy group said it paid for coffee carts in 21 high schools this past school year. In the Southwest, a dairy group gave grants to seven schools for coffee programs. Not all high school coffee bars get grants from dairy groups, and the money may only cover a small portion of costs. School food operators also say lattes offer other benefits, such as giving teens a reason to stay on school grounds. At a national convention for school lunch officials this month, one session will also detail how schools in Orange County, Florida used coffee drinks to get students to buy lunch. For an extra $2, students can turn the cup of milk served with lunch into a coffee drink at a nearby cart. Without the lunch, it costs $3. The Orange County schools did not receive industry grants for the coffee bars, but the local dairy council provided chalkboard-style signs and menus. Cafeteria directors and dairy groups say coffee drinks in schools have to follow nutrition standards, making them healthier than the lattes students would get anyway outside schools. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which sets rules for schools participating in its meal programs, says high schools can sell espresso drinks that are no bigger than 12 ounces, and that are made with fat-free or 1% milk. The drinks have around 150 calories, school food directors say. But not everyone thinks teens should drink coffee, or that they need milk. The American Academy of Pediatrics discourages caffeine consumption among children, citing potentially harmful effects on developing bodies. And while dairy is an efficient way to get calcium and vitamin D, it\u2019s not the only way to get such nutrients, said Dr. Natalie Muth, a pediatrician and representative for the American Academy of Pediatrics. As for lattes, Muth said there are ways to encourage students to get the nutrients of milk without promoting caffeine habits that could lead to headaches, agitation and lack of sleep. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to be having that outside of school, that\u2019s one thing. But in schools, the idea is to promote good health and nutrition,\u201d Muth said. Exactly how schools prepare coffee drinks can vary, but milk is a primary ingredient for lattes. \u201cIt\u2019s really milk with some coffee, as far as proportion,\u201d said Julie Ostrow of Midwest Dairy. It\u2019s why the group is providing a grant for a coffee bar at a fourth high school in the Fort Zumwalt, Missouri district this upcoming year. In exchange, the group gets data on how much milk is used for the lattes, as well as information for personal pizzas, mozzarella sticks and other products with dairy. But the group might not be happy about one of the newer options: This past year, the coffee bars began offering almond milk for 40 cents extra, said Paul Becker, the district\u2019s food director. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

So, in 2011, he's talking about \"\"comprehensive court reform.\"\" Addressing a group of nearly 50 reporters and editors at the annual pre-session meeting organized by the Associated Press, Cannon again made his case that the court system should not have removed constitutional amendments that, if approved by voters, would have granted tax breaks for first-time home buyers and affected state redistricting. A third amendment was drafted in response to the new federal health care law to prohibit Florida from participating in any health insurance exchange that compels people to buy insurance. All three amendments were stripped from the ballot after judges ruled that the attached ballot language was either flawed or misleading. Cannon said he will propose legislative changes to effectively remove or diminish judicial review of ballot questions. But that's not all. \"\"Florida's judicial system has the authority to take away not only a person's liberty, but also a person's life. Understanding the severity and irreversible nature of that penalty, we have a responsibility to ensure that justice is administered not only fairly, but also efficiently,\"\" Cannon said. \"\"Criminal cases are complex in nature and in recent years we've seen cases overturned, and there have been errors. The number of inmates since 2000 on death row dying of natural causes has now surpassed the number of inmates executed. Significant and unreasonable delays plague the current process of conducting state post-conviction review in these cases and it appears that there is little the Supreme Court can do to improve or streamline the process.\"\" Cannon said that is where the Legislature can step in. \"\"I believe the Legislature can and should work with the judicial branch to significantly improve the administration of justice in death penalty cases,\"\" he said. \"\"I am hopeful that reform could lead to a more equitable judicial system for all Floridians, and as we move forward toward the 2011 legislative session, we will continue to explore this issue to determine when and what the right course of action for Florida may be.\"\" Cannon hasn't specified what court reform legislation might look like, though by his comments it sure sounds like he wants the appeals process in death row cases hastened. In that vein, we decided to check his facts about Florida's death row, focusing on this claim: \"\"The number of inmates since 2000 on death row dying of natural causes has now surpassed the number of inmates executed.\"\" Of the 392 people now on Florida's death row,\u00a0House records indicate that\u00a0145 inmates\u00a0have been there for 20 years or longer and 34\u00a0have been there for 30 years or more, according to Cannon spokeswoman Katie Betta. Gary Alvord has been on Florida's death row since April 1974, according to the Florida Department of Corrections. Alvord escaped a Michigan mental hospital and wound up in Tampa, where he killed three women. Alvord, who turned 64 on Jan. 10, 2011, has been on death row for more than 13,400 days. This April, he will have been awaiting execution for\u00a037 years. John Vining, who was sentenced to death in 1990, is the oldest person on death row. On March 13, 2011, he will turn 80. Vining was\u00a0convicted of shooting and killing a woman who was trying to sell him a $60,000 diamond. Since Florida reinstated the death penalty in 1976 (and began carrying out sentences in 1979), 69 people have been executed -- a rate of a little over two per year. One reason, for starters,\u00a0is a lengthy and costly appeals process. But politics plays a role as well. The governor must sign a death warrant for an execution to proceed. And sometimes\u00a0other complicating factors are cited. Alvord, for instance, has a long history of mental illness and has been declared mentally incompetent by several courts. The last person to be executed in Florida was Martin Grossman in February 2010. Grossman was convicted of shooting a Pinellas County wildlife officer who happened upon Grossman shooting a stolen handgun in a wooded area. Gov. Charlie Crist signed the death warrant of David Eugene Johnston in 2010 as well, but Johnston died while awaiting his sentence. He was convicted of stabbing an 84-year-old Orlando woman to death in 1983. That transitions naturally to Cannon's claim. The Florida Department of Corrections provided PolitiFact Florida with a list of 55 inmates who died on death row starting Jan. 1, 2000. Thirty of the 55 somehow died while awaiting their sentence (the state does not describe the nature of a person's death), and 25 were executed. For example, Eddie Lee Sexton Sr. died on Dec. 29, 2010, while living on death row. Sexton was convicted of murder after a jury found that he ordered his mentally impaired son to strangle Sexton's son-in-law at a Florida park. Sexton feared that the son-in-law was going to report family abuses to local authorities, prosecutors said. Sexton was sentenced to death in 1998. Robert Power died on Dec. 3, 2010, while awaiting sentence for the rape and murder of a 12-year-old Orange County girl. Power had been on death row for 20 years. The waiting and appeals process certainly comes with additional cost. The Death Penalty Information Center, a Washington policy group that does not advocate for or against the death penalty, published a 2009 report discussing the cost of enforcing the death penalty. The group cited a 2000 Palm Beach Post analysis, which said that the state spends $51 million a year enforcing the death penalty. That's $51 million a year more than it would cost to punish all first-degree murderers with life in prison instead. The figure has been repeated by several other news publications as well as Rex Dimmig, chief assistant public defender of the 10th Judicial Circuit, in testimony before a state Senate committee discussing the death penalty. Make no mistake, the death penalty is a controversial and complex policy issue. But here, we're focusing on Cannon's call for reforms based on death row inmate data. He said: \"\"The number of inmates since 2000 on death row dying of natural causes has now surpassed the number of inmates executed.\"\" He's right.

A quick web search shows the prices ranging from $10 to $30, based on information from the CDC. And free shots are regularly available at public health centers as well. The story does a good job of explaining what the actual benefits of the influenza vaccine really are. Just as a recent HealthNewsReview.org\u00a0blog post did, the story goes way beyond the typical media version touting claims of X-percent effectiveness and explains what that means in terms of individual people escaping flu symptoms. This accuracy of interpretation does carry with it, however, one risk:\u00a0 For a public so used to hearing that vaccines are, say, 60 percent effective, actually finding out that they\u2019d only prevent one person from getting symptoms for every 33 people vaccinated may\u00a0not sound good enough for the\u00a0lay person. The story does mention that the risks of negative reactions to getting a flu shot usually center on inflammation at the site of the injection, a comparatively minor side effect. It emphasizes that given such a minimal risk, there are very few harms for getting this protection, minimal though it may be in some years. The story gives readers the results of numerous meta-studies that compile partial answers on the vaccine\u2019s effectiveness. It also rightly points out the limitations of those studies, and the research they\u2019re based on, in that ethics forbids the kind of control versus placebo trials that could show cause and effect.

The story does mention the meager alternatives to influenza vaccination \u2014 that is, proper hand washing hygiene and the isolation of flu patients from those free of the disease. The story offers answers to basic questions about the value of getting an annual flu shot. Those questions are obviously based on the fact that flu vaccines are usually readily available for those who want them. While some years present a possible shortage of vaccine, for most years, vaccination is determined by personal choice, rather than availability. The story appropriately explains that this vaccine has been around for decades.

In the end, it decided against adopting the drug for executions. Attorney General William Barr announced in July his department instead would use pentobarbital, a barbiturate, when it resumes federal executions later this year, ending a de facto moratorium on the punishment put in place by the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama. But the special consideration given to the possibilities of fentanyl, even as federal agents were focused on seizing illegal imports of the synthetic opioid, show how much has changed since the federal government last carried out an execution nearly 20 years ago. Many pharmaceutical companies have since put tight controls on their distribution channels to stop their drugs being used in executions. As old supply chains vanished, many states, and the federal government in turn, have been forced to tinker with their lethal recipes. They have experimented with different drugs, in some cases leading to grisly \u201cbotched\u201d executions in which the condemned prisoners have visibly suffered prolonged, excruciating deaths, viewed by some as a breach of the constitutional ban on \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d punishments. In 2017, Nebraska and Nevada announced they would use fentanyl, which is 100 times more powerful than morphine, in new multi-drug execution protocols. By 2018, the U.S. Justice Department was also examining the \u201cuse of fentanyl as part of a lethal injection protocol,\u201d according to a three-page internal memorandum from March 2018 by the director of the department\u2019s Bureau of Prisons. The Justice Department revealed the memo\u2019s existence in an August court filing after a federal judge ordered it to produce a complete \u201cadministrative record\u201d showing how it arrived at the new pentobarbital execution protocol announced in July. The full contents of the memo are not public. It is not known why the department decided to examine fentanyl, what supply channels were considered or why it ultimately rejected fentanyl as a protocol. The government\u2019s court filing shows the only other named drug examined as the subject of a department memo was pentobarbital, the drug it now says it wants to use in December and January to kill five of the 61 prisoners awaiting execution on federal death row. Wyn Hornbuckle, a department spokesman, declined to share a copy of the memo or to answer questions about the government\u2019s execution protocol. Mark Inch, who was the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 director at the time, acknowledged in a brief telephone interview writing the memo. Inch, who abruptly resigned a couple months after writing the memo, declined to answer questions, in part because he said it would be in conflict with his current role running Florida\u2019s Department of Corrections. Doctors can prescribe fentanyl for treating severe pain. In recent years, illegal fentanyl has become a common additive in bootleg pain pills and other street drugs, contributing to the tens of thousands of opioid overdose deaths in the country each year. Even tiny quantities can slow or stop a person\u2019s breathing. Earlier this year, an Ohio lawmaker proposed using some of the illegal fentanyl seized from drug traffickers to execute condemned inmates. Death penalty researchers say that just because a drug is deadly does not mean it is always appropriate as an execution drug. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019d be a surprise that the government would be looking at alternative methods of carrying out lethal injection, and fentanyl has been in the news,\u201d Robert Dunham, the director of the Washington-based non-profit group the Death Penalty Information Center, said in an interview. \u201cBut there is just something fundamentally wrong about using a drug implicated in illegal activities as your method of executing prisoners.\u201d   In August 2018, Carey Dean Moore became the first person in the United States to be executed using a protocol that included fentanyl. Nebraska prison officials injected him with fentanyl and three other drugs. Moore took 23 minutes to die.

But to some observers, Fox\u2019s intense promotion of Kelly\u2019s June 3 interview with parents Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar and her later sit-down with two daughters molested by Josh Duggar marked a drastic shift in the network\u2019s coverage of the story. \"\"It\u2019s slightly amusing that Fox News barely covered this scandal until Megyn Kelly was able to secure this interview,\"\" said CNN senior media correspondent and Reliable Sources host Brian Stelter on June 2. \"\"Now they\u2019ll be covering it a lot more.\"\" We wanted to double-check Stelter\u2019s analysis. Was Fox News essentially mum about the story until Kelly scored the at-home exclusive? Stelter told PunditFact that he first started thinking about the coverage disparity when he saw a story by liberal site Media Matters for America that compared light coverage by Fox with intensive coverage by MSNBC and CNN. He and CNNMoney media reporter Tom Kludt did their own research and reached a similar conclusion for a story about the interview. \"\"Along with the amount of time spent, we took into account the type of Fox's coverage,\"\" Stelter said. \"\"Early on, the mentions of the controversy were fleeting, not substantive at all.\"\" The controversy went public when In Touch Weekly published the first story May 19 about Josh Duggar being the suspect in a 2005 underage sexual abuse investigation. In Touch and the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette published more stories May 21 based on a police report that said the father did not go to law enforcement until a year after the fondling incidents took place. After the stories appeared, Josh Duggar resigned his position as executive director of the Family Research Council and apologized in a statement, saying, \"\"Twelve years ago, as a young teenager I acted inexcusably for which I am extremely sorry and deeply regret. I hurt others, including my family and close friends. I confessed this to my parents who took several steps to help me address the situation.\"\" TLC pulled all episodes of 19 Kids and Counting the next day, May 22. Fox first told its viewers about the situation in a 30-second segment on May 22, followed by a \u00a020-second segment on May 23. On May 26, the Duggars were mentioned on The Five in the context of Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee defending the family. \"\"You don\u2019t go around defending the Duggar family when you\u2019ve got bigger issues going on,\"\" said pundit Greg Gutfeld. Fox analyst Howard Kurtz criticized the media\u2019s focus on the Duggar family in a May 24 segment. Those are the only references we could find before May 30, when Kelly\u2019s interview was announced. Needless to say, those mentions of the story were super-brief \u2014 especially when you compare how the other networks handled it. CNN and MSNBC anchors devoted considerably more time to the controversy from the start. We used Critical Mention, which searches closed-captioning transcripts, to look for mentions of the Duggars on the three networks from May 19 to noon on May 30, roughly when the interview was announced. This method isn\u2019t perfect \u2014 misspellings aren\u2019t captured, for instance \u2014 but it does provide a rough snapshot of how often each network discussed the family. Fox News personalities mentioned \"\"Duggar\"\" four times. Within the same timeframe, the family name came up 99 times on CNN and 72 times on MSNBC. On Stelter\u2019s home network of CNN, the story was brought up on five different shows on May 22, with Erin Burnett OutFront and Anderson Cooper 360 devoting substantial chunks of air time to interviews with an In Touch staffer and child psychiatry professionals, as well as going into other TLC shows with stars that fell from grace. CNN Tonight host Don Lemon continued to explore the story in his May 26-28 shows. On MSNBC, nearly every show on May 22 talked about the story, including hosts Alex Wagner, Ed Schultz, Al Sharpton and Chris Hayes, often bringing in experts to dissect some of the story\u2019s finer points. The network continued to cover the story on May 26, 27 and 28. Fox began to report the story in more depth on June 1, when Kelly criticized the media\u2019s handling of the story with Fox media analyst Howard Kurtz. She equated the rush to cover the story as feasting on a carcass, going after CNN specifically for bringing up how GOP presidential candidates had taken pictures with Josh Duggar before the scandal broke. Kelly\u2019s coverage of the story has also focused on the release of police records, which she and the Duggars say should have never been made public. Other shows on the network, including The O\u2019Reilly Factor, Outnumbered, Your World and Fox and Friends, started talking about the Duggars in the context of Kelly\u2019s interview. From noon on May 30 to about 5 p.m. on\u00a0June 5, there have been 134 mentions of \"\"Duggar\"\" on Fox, according to Critical Mention. Fox News spokespersons did not offer comment for the story. Our ruling Stelter said, \"\"Fox News barely covered this scandal until Megyn Kelly was able to secure this interview.\"\" Our review of media mentions of the Duggar story among CNN, MSNBC and Fox supports his statement.

Wisconsin witnessed a historic set of nine recall elections in the summer of 2011. Voters removed two Republican state senators from office. But Ryan, whose city calls itself the bratwurst capital of the world, claims his removal would be unique -- partly because it would not involve a recall. On Aug. 15, 2011, the Sheboygan Common Council launched a process that could eventually take Ryan, who has resisted calls to resign, out of office. If the move plays out, Ryan essentially would be put on trial with the council acting as judge and jury, according to a Sheboygan Press article and Sheboygan City Attorney Steve McLean. Ryan made his claim to aldermen during the Aug. 15 council meeting, according to WBAY-TV in Green Bay. \"\"This whole thing stinks. If you want to take me out of office, by all means start your recall,\"\" he said. \"\"If you want to go down this path, it's not a threat, it's a fact, it's never been done. There's never been a public official removed from office in this state for anything but malfeasance in office. I'm here to do a job. I will continue to do that job. You should know by now, I never quit. Ever.\"\" For us, the key claim is this sentence:  \"\"There's never been a public official removed from office in this state for anything but malfeasance in office.\"\" Never is a long time. Ryan didn\u2019t return our call and emails over two days asking him to clarify his claim and to provide evidence for it. \"\"Public official,\"\" for example, could mean an elected official or an appointed one, such as a school superintendent. But our sense is Ryan was referring to elected officials like himself being removed by a governmental body, and not the voters. Ryan has argued that his drinking -- he has admitted to being an alcoholic -- has not affected his duties as mayor. The saga in Sheboygan, a Lake Michigan community of about 50,000 people 60 miles north of Milwaukee, began in September 2009, six months after Ryan, 48, was elected mayor. He called a news conference to apologize for making a sexually explicit remark about his wife\u2019s sister. Ryan\u2019s remark was captured on video, posted on YouTube, became fodder for Jay Leno and led the Common Council to censure him. The drama intensified in July 2011, when news surfaced that Ryan was issued a warning by police after a weekend of drinking at taverns in Elkhart Lake, becoming rude and obnoxious and passing out at least once. The Common Council voted to begin the removal process after Ryan refused its call to resign. To see whether Ryan\u2019s claim is correct, we contacted a number of experts. They include state government entities -- the Legislative Reference Bureau, the Historical Society, the Department of Public Instruction and the Judicial Commission; statewide associations -- the League of Municipalities, the Counties Association and the Association of School Boards; political scientists -- Dennis Dresang of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Joe Heim of the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse; and Milwaukee historian John Gurda. Here\u2019s what we found:  Fatal shooting: In 1842, six years before Wisconsin became a state, James Vineyard, a member of the Territorial Legislature\u2019s version of the state Senate, shot and killed fellow member Charles C.P. Arndt during an argument after a legislative session adjourned. Vineyard was expelled from the legislature after it refused to accept his resignation, although he was acquitted of manslaughter at trial, according to the Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau and the Wisconsin Historical Society. Given that the shooting occurred on the legislative floor, it could be fairly argued that the removal was related to misconduct in office. So, that one does not directly undercut Ryan\u2019s claim. Felony crimes: At least four state lawmakers have been removed from office after being convicted of a felony. But under state law, the expulsions were automatic -- no action needed to be taken by the Legislature -- so that makes their removals different than Ryan\u2019s would be. Crimes not directly related to official duties also have led to removals that were not automatic. For example, the New Holstein School Board fired Christopher J. Nelson, the district\u2019s superintendent, after he was charged in February 2011 with trying to set up a sexual encounter with a person he thought was a 15-year-old boy. That could undercut Ryan\u2019s claim, but Nelson was an appointed official, not elected. Non-criminal removal: In 1992, the state Supreme Court removed Racine County Circuit Court Judge Jon Skow from the bench after he admitted he was permanently disabled from stress and depression. The high court determined that Skow, who suffered from alcoholism, could not carry out his duties. He previously had been suspended following a number of incidents, including leaving the bench during a trial. That case does undercut Ryan\u2019s claim, since the judge was not removed for malfeasance in office. As rare as removals from office appear to be, at least two other Wisconsin mayors have been targeted for removal since 2008. The Common Council in Montello, 60 miles north of Madison, removed Mayor Frank Breitenbach in August 2008 for reasons related to misconduct in office, according to the Wisconsin State Journal. He faced 15 allegations by city employees and residents, including using profanity with employees and threatening to fire Montello's police chief without legal authority. In Marinette, a Lake Michigan community 120 miles north of Sheboygan, a Common Council committee recommended hiring a special prosecutor in an effort to remove Mayor Robert Harbick from office. Harbick had pleaded no contest to first-offense drunken-driving, which is a traffic violation in Wisconsin. But the removal process failed to proceed when the proposal to hire the attorney failed in a 4-4 vote before the full council in August 2011. Let\u2019s review what we\u2019ve found. The embattled Sheboygan mayor said no public official in Wisconsin has ever been removed from office \"\"for anything but malfeasance in office.\"\" Ryan\u2019s reference was not to recall elections or automatic removal, but removal by a governmental body such as a city council. Our sense is it\u2019s likely the mayor was speaking of elected officials, and we could find only one instance, involving a judge, in which a removal was not for misconduct in office. We also found a school superintendent fired by a school board following the filing of criminal charges, but he did not hold an elected position. This is a statement we could revisit if more information surfaces; after all we\u2019re talking about more than 150 years of history and countless governmental entities in Wisconsin. For now, we feel Ryan\u2019s statement needs a little clarification, but is essentially accurate -- our definition of .\"", "output": "\"Outside of recall elections, \"\"there's never been a public official removed from office\"\" in Wisconsin \"\"for anything but malfeasance in office.\"", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "The American Academy of Pediatrics, in calling on the legal right for same-sex couples to marry, said children\u2019s well-being is affected far more by other factors such as their parents\u2019 health and economic security than their sexual orientation. \u201cIt is better that children have two parents than one parent, and assuming that these parents love each other and love the child and have economic and social security and stability, then that\u2019s the critical ingredient for the optimal growth and development of the child,\u201d said Dr. Benjamin Siegel, head of an AAP committee that studied the issue. Siegel said the academy\u2019s board of directors voted unanimously for the organization, which represents 60,000 pediatricians, to support same-sex marriage as well as the right for gay parents to adopt or foster children. \u201cWe need to have laws and regulations that support families to nurture children,\u201d said Siegel, a pediatrician at Boston Medical Center and the Boston University School of Medicine. The U.S. Supreme Court is preparing to take up two major gay rights cases next week, one on federal benefits for same-sex married couples and another on California\u2019s law defining marriage as between a man and a woman. Recent Reuters/Ipsos polls have found a majority of Americans support same-sex marriage and access to federal benefits such as such as tax exemptions for a surviving spouse\u2019s inheritance. Close to 2 million American children already are being raised by gay and lesbian parents, according to the pediatric group. The group previously backed allowing a biological parent\u2019s partner to adopt a child and allowing same-sex spouses to receive federal benefits. But its new statement, published in the journal Pediatrics, is based on more recent data showings kids do just as well when they are raised by parents of the same or different genders. \u201cScientific evidence affirms that children have similar developmental and emotional needs and receive similar parenting whether they are raised by parents of the same or different genders,\u201d AAP said, citing research over the last 30 years. One 2010 study in the journal Pediatrics found teenagers with lesbian moms performed better in school and had fewer social problems, for example, when compared to teens with a mother and father (reut.rs/i7bS6w). Some gay rights opponents have questioned the long-term effects of gay marriage on children. \u201cThere cannot yet be decisive evidence,\u201d George Will, a conservative columnist, wrote in The Washington Post last week about whether same-sex marriage was harmful. Nine states and Washington, D.C., have legalized same-sex marriage. Public and political support for marriage equality has grown in recent years and on Monday, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton became the latest politician to come out in favor of same-sex marriage. The pediatrician\u2019s group said marriage, not civil unions, is key because it offers families stronger economic security and helps avoid issues of discrimination, intolerance and inequality that can affect parents\u2019 self-esteem. Various state laws on adoption by gay and lesbian parents are also \u201can inconsistent patchwork,\u201d it added.

Hassan brought up the point in the first televised debate against Republican incumbent Kelly Ayotte. \"\"With her solution, terrorists can still today \u2014 and by the way ISIS knows it, they have been advertising it \u2014 buy guns online and at gun shows in the United States of America,\"\" Hassan said on the debate stage at New England College. Is it really a point terrorists are spreading? Let\u2019s look. PolitiFact has already looked into Hassan\u2019s claim that Ayotte voted against a proposal to expand background checks and found it . Here we are going to look at what ISIS says about buying guns in America. Hassan\u2019s camp pointed us to a series of news articles in which members of various terrorist groups talk about the ease of getting guns in the U.S. A former Islamic State recruit told the New York Times in August that the terrorist group tries to draw its recruits from within the U.S. because they can buy guns without a middleman. \"\"For America and Canada, it\u2019s much easier for them to get them over the social network, because they say the Americans are dumb \u2014 they have open gun policies,\"\" Harry Sarfo told the Times from a German prison, when explaining attitudes within the terror group. \"\"They say we can radicalize them easily, and if they have no prior record, they can buy guns, so we don\u2019t need to have a contact man who has to provide guns for them.\"\" Hassan\u2019s camp also directed us to a 2011 video featuring American-born al Qaeda spokesman Adam Gadahn in which he talked about lax gun laws in the U.S. and urged followers to take advantage of them. \"\"America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms,\"\" Gadahn said, according to CNN. \"\"You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle, without a background check, and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?\"\" Gadahn was with al-Qaeda, not ISIS. Still, he urged terrorists to buy guns in the United States and use them against Western governments. Those two examples are enough to show that terrorists have advertised the U.S. gun laws, and \"\"it is something they think about internally,\"\" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism specialist at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Still, it\u2019s difficult to determine if these are part of a widespread advertising campaign, or just isolated examples. A lof of ISIS communication is never circulated on the internet, Gartenstein-Ross cautioned. On other occasions, PolitiFact has examined whether people can buy guns without background checks. Currently federal law requires prospective gun buyers undergo background checks when they buy guns from federally licensed dealers -- but there are notable exceptions. Anyone who repeatedly buys and sells firearms \"\"with the principal motive of making a profit\"\" has to get a dealer\u2019s license, whether they deal out of a brick-and-mortar store, at a flea market, or online, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Licensed firearm dealers must run background checks on non-licensed buyers before selling them a gun. But the law does not require a dealer\u2019s license for private hobbyists and others who occasionally buy and sell guns for the purpose of enhancing or liquidating a collection. So if an individual buys a gun from a hobbyist over the Internet, or at a gun show, he or she would not be subject to a background check. It\u2019s worth noting that private sales, online or otherwise, cannot take place across state lines, so the buyer and seller must be in the same state. And there are many restrictions on shipping guns, so the actual transfer of the gun is likely to take place in person. Second, it is illegal for private sellers to transfer a gun to someone they either know or reasonably believe is prohibited from owning a gun, for example, if the seller knows the buyer is a felon. But online sellers \"\"can give themselves plausible deniability by not asking the necessary questions,\"\" Garen Wintemute, a professor of emergency medicine at the University of California Davis, has previously told PolitiFact. Additionally, several states \u2014 California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington \u2014 and the District of Columbia require background checks for all private gun sales. There is a sizeable online market for private, background check-free gun sales, according to a 2013 study by Third Way, a center-left think tank. Focusing on the website Armslist.com, a sort of Craigslist for firearms and accessories, in 10 states, Third Way found 2,000 ads from individuals looking to purchase guns from private sellers specifically. Congressional efforts to expand background checks for purchases made at gun shows or online have failed. A recent review by the New York Times found the majority of guns used in 16 recent mass shootings were obtained legally, including the attack in Orlando that left nearly 50 people dead. The shooter in that incident, Omar Mateen, pledged allegiance to the Islamic State before he gunned down patrons at the Pulse nightclub. Our ruling Hassan said the Islamic State knows its followers can buy firearms \"\"online and at gun shows\"\" and is \"\"advertising it.\"\" An interview in the New York Times with a former Islamic State recruit shows group members acknowledge American recruits can buy guns, so long as they don\u2019t have a record. And a 2011 video from an al Qaeda spokesman urges terrorists to buy guns in the United States and use them against Western governments. There is little evidence to suggest a widespread advertising campaign, but it\u2019s hard to tell, because not all ISIS communication is on the Internet, either.\"", "output": "With her solution, terrorists can still today \u2014 and by the way ISIS knows it, they have been advertising it \u2014 buy guns online and at gun shows in the United States of America.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "No discussion of costs \u2013 not of PSA testing nor of subsequent biopsies.

Kerala received rainfall more than 40 percent greater than normal for the monsoon season, which runs from June to September.

Light to moderate rain was expected across Kerala on Monday, promising respite to rescue workers, who have battled rising waters and mudslides to reach tens of thousands of stranded villagers. In one of the worst-hit areas, Chengannur, about 100 km (62 miles) from Kochi, a long queue of women snaked out of a medical camp at the main relief center.

But business groups say the state\u2019s own data shows Colorado would meet EPA standards if not for pollution from other states and even other continents. Lowering the air rating would hurt the economy by increasing the cost of doing business, they say. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about tens of millions of dollars in direct and indirect costs,\u201d Paul Seby, an attorney representing Defend Colorado, said in an interview before the hearing. Defend Colorado advocates for business and industry on state and federal regulation. Denver and the northern Colorado urban corridor have struggled to meet EPA ozone standards for 15 years. Ground-level ozone can aggravate asthma and contribute to early deaths from respiratory disease. It\u2019s the main component of smog, and it\u2019s created from pollution emitted by vehicles, industries, solvents and other sources. Clean-air advocates welcomed Polis\u2019 decision to pull the state\u2019s request for an exemption. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal,\u201d said Christine Berg, Colorado field consultant for Moms Clean Air Force. \u201cWe know ozone pollution is particularly harmful for children.\u201d At Friday\u2019s hearing, several people told the EPA they blame ozone for their health problems. \u201cI\u2019m someone who never used to have breathing problems,\u201d said Marie Venner, who lives in the Denver suburb of Lakewood. Now, it sometimes hurts to take a breath, she said. Seby said Polis\u2019 decision was based on politics, not facts. Polis\u2019 predecessor, Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper \u2014 who ended his presidential bid last month and is now running for the U.S. Senate \u2014 had asked for the exemption based on data showing that pollution elsewhere and forest fire smoke from other states had pushed Colorado over the limit, Seby said. \u201cGov. Polis came into office and the exact opposite came about,\u201d Seby said. \u201cThe data didn\u2019t change, the science didn\u2019t change \u2014 except for the politics.\u201d Seby said hundreds of businesses and institutions could be affected if Colorado\u2019s air rating is downgraded: oil and gas drilling, refineries, large breweries, print shops, wastewater treatment plants and hospitals. Anna Unruh, an air quality consultant for Trinity Consultants, which helps businesses get environmental permits and comply with regulations, agreed that a lower rating would complicate life for businesses and industry. New businesses and expansion projects might have to go through a longer, more rigorous process to get permits, she said. Existing operations might have to get an additional permit. More businesses would have to devote employee time to monitoring and reporting on their pollution. \u201cPermitting definitely will get more difficult,\u201d she said in an interview. Failing to act on dirty air also has economic costs, especially to Colorado\u2019s vital tourism economy said Robert Ukeiley, an attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity. Nitrogen and other pollutants are affecting the environment and the views in Rocky Mountain National Park, the third-most-visited park in the nation, about 60 miles (95 kilometers) northwest of downtown Denver. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to go to a national park and look at smog,\u201d Ukeiley told the EPA at Friday\u2019s hearing. In addition to Denver, counties affected by the change are Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Douglas, Jefferson, Larimer and Weld. ___ Follow Dan Elliott at http://twitter.com/DanElliottAP .", "output": "In a twist, Colorado asks EPA to lower state\u2019s air rating.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "Once an illness is added to the list of approved conditions, the board cannot remove it because state law does not give the board authority to do so, according to board spokeswoman Tessie Pollock.

Senate Democrats also plan to move ahead on seven other bills including a study on the long-term health effects of e-cigarette use and laws preventing tobacco ads and new tobacco stores from popping up near schools. It\u2019s less clear how lawmakers will act on Democratic Sen. Brad Hoylman\u2019s bill to ban all flavored tobacco products \u2014 including menthol cigarettes. The exclusion of menthol flavorings from tobacco restrictions at the state and federal levels has long drawn criticism from public health and civil rights groups who say the tobacco industry has marketed menthol cigarettes to African Americans for decades. \u201cIt always seemed very normal and accessible so I never really questioned it,\u201d Albany high school senior Hassani Hamilton, 17, said. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve come to realize is these products are deadly and their rampant use in my community is no accident.\u201d New York state health officials issued a ban on most flavored e-cigarettes last fall in response to worries that vaping may cause illnesses and that its use is growing among teenagers who say they\u2019re attracted by flavorings. But the ban\u2019s exclusion of menthol and tobacco flavorings drew scrutiny from a state judge in her decision to continue to block it Friday. The ban was initially blocked last fall after the vaping industry sued to stop New York from enforcing emergency regulations banning the sale of most flavored e-cigarettes. Acting Supreme Court Justice Catherine Cholakis said state health regulators went beyond their authority when they passed the ban, which she said touched on policy issues that lawmakers should decide. Judge Cholakis said it\u2019s a \u201cnatural question\u201d why the regulations excluded tobacco and menthol e-liquid flavors when she hasn\u2019t seen evidence that supports continued use of those flavors. Hamilton and representatives of public health and civil rights groups urged lawmakers Monday to ban all flavored cigarette products, and not just e-cigarettes. Cigarette smoking causes about one of every five deaths in the United States each year and 93% of adult African American smokers began smoking by using menthol cigarettes, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cIt is the direct result of a targeted and well-funded effort by the tobacco companies over the last several decades to addict communities like mine to nicotine and tobacco,\u201d Hamilton said. But it\u2019s unclear whether there\u2019s broad support to ban all flavored cigarettes in New York. Republican Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker last year signed a bill to allow the nation\u2019s first ban of menthol cigarettes starting in June. New York\u2019s governor has said he\u2019ll propose legislation this year to prohibit the sale of \u201call\u201d flavored e-cigarettes and ban vaping ads targeted to youth. It\u2019s unclear whether Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s legislation would include menthol and tobacco flavorings, which the state\u2019s health commissioner has recommended. Cuomo has expressed concern that a New York ban on menthol cigarettes could run into legal issues because they\u2019re allowed on the federal level. A proposed federal ban on menthol cigarettes has stalled. And President Donald Trump\u2019s vaping ban excludes menthol flavoring. The vaping industry praised the judge\u2019s Friday decision and said bans don\u2019t work. \u201cWith this important ruling, the court has prevented the state from creating a huge new black market and ushering in a new public health crisis along with it \u2014 something that may still come to pass if the New York Legislature bans flavors,\u201d Vapor Technology Association Executive Director Tony Abboud said.", "output": "New York called to include menthol in flavored tobacco ban.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "Health department spokeswoman Melaney Arnold on Thursday declined to give the age of the victim or the time or location of the death, citing privacy concerns.

His team studied a group of nearly 675,000 Swedes born between 1973 and 1979. They found that children born before 37 weeks of pregnancy were much more likely to die before age five than others.

The addition of Trump appointees Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch could alter the conservative-majority court\u2019s approach to abortion. Kavanaugh replaced Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative who backed abortion rights in key rulings in 1992 and 2016. Jennifer Popik, director of federal legislation for the anti-abortion National Right to Life Committee, said her group hopes Kavanaugh and Gorsuch will \u201cinterpret the Constitution more narrowly\u201d on abortion rights. In Congress, legislation backed by Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans already has been introduced to restrict late-term abortions along the lines discussed by Trump, but there are not enough votes to pass it given Democratic opposition. Abortion is one of the most contentious issues in U.S. politics. Trump, whose abortion views have been fluid over the years, has emerged as an advocate of more restrictions, a position that appeals to his conservative voter base. His address on Tuesday night in some ways kicked off his 2020 re-election campaign. His call for new limits on late-term abortions was welcomed by anti-abortion activists. When he ran for president in 2016, Trump said he would appoint anti-abortion judges who would vote to overturn the landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling Roe v. Wade that recognized a woman\u2019s constitutional right to abortion and legalized the procedure nationwide. In his State of the Union address, Trump criticized a New York law and legislation in Virginia that would in limited circumstances allow for late-term abortions when the mother\u2019s health is endangered. \u201cTo defend the dignity of every person, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother\u2019s womb,\u201d Trump said during the speech, without specifying details. A White House spokeswoman said Trump backs legislation pending in Congress that would ban abortions after 20 weeks. Jennifer Dalven, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which backs abortion rights, called Trump\u2019s comments \u201csmoke and mirrors.\u201d   \u201cThis is really just a distraction. The goal is not to end a certain class of abortion. His goal is to end all abortions,\u201d Dalven added. There is no nationwide law setting a specific limit on when in a pregnancy abortions can be performed. Each state has its own laws, with conservative states imposing restrictions and liberal states more broadly backing abortion rights. Republicans have embraced the federal legislation to ban abortion after 20 weeks. But past bills have failed to overcome Democratic opposition, even when Republicans controlled both the House of Representatives and the Senate. With the House now led by Democrats and the Senate by Republicans, there is even less chance of such legislation passing, though Republicans said on Wednesday they would press for a vote. As of the end of last year, 17 states had laws banning abortions 20 weeks after fertilization, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research organization that supports abortion rights. No states categorically ban all late-term abortions in all circumstances and 43 states have laws that impose at least some restrictions, it said. The Roe v. Wade ruling, reaffirmed by the high court in 1992, concluded that abortion could not be banned before the fetus is viable, but gave states leeway to impose greater restrictions on it toward the end of a pregnancy. In 2007, the court upheld a federal restriction on \u201cpartial-birth abortions\u201d that involve a physician removing most of the fetus intact rather than dismembering it. In its most recent major abortion ruling, the Supreme Court - with Kennedy joining the court\u2019s four liberals in the majority - in 2016 struck down regulations in Texas that abortion rights advocates said would shutter many clinics. The Louisiana case pending before the justices resembles the Texas case. It involves a requirement that doctors who perform abortions have a difficult-to-obtain arrangement called \u201cadmitting privileges\u201d at a hospital within 30 miles (48 km) of the clinic. The provision was challenged by abortion rights advocates. If the court rejects their request, it would represent a shift away from the 2016 ruling following Kennedy\u2019s retirement. The court will also decide soon whether to hear Indiana\u2019s bid to revive a state ban on abortions performed due to the sex or race of the fetus or evidence of disability.

A trial of the treatment in humans is set to start in Europe this year, said Dr. Navzer Engineer of MicroTransponder, a medical device company affiliated with The University of Texas at Dallas, whose study appears in the journal Nature. Tinnitus is sometimes brought on by hearing loss. It occurs as cells in the inner ear are damaged, often from a loud noise. Current drugs help mask tinnitus, but the condition is incurable. Engineer\u2019s team thinks tinnitus may be caused when too many brain cells become tuned to a specific tone in the brain. So his team set out to train the brain to ignore the nerve signals that cause the ringing sound. To do this, they paired a device that sends electrical impulses to the vagus nerve in the neck with different sounds. Stimulating this nerve releases chemicals such as acetylcholine and norepinephrine that trigger changes in the brain. The University of Texas at Dallas team tested this approach in a series of experiments with rats, using an indirect but accepted method of testing hearing in animals. In one, they stimulated the vagus nerve while playing different sounds 300 times a day for 20 days to a group of eight rats with a form of tinnitus. The tones were close to the frequency of the ringing sound, and the hope was to trick some of the nerve cells into listening to the new tones rather than the ringing tone. When the team checked the nerve responses to different tones, the tinnitus had disappeared in rats exposed to the tones and nerve stimulation, but it persisted in a group of control animals. \u201cUnlike previous treatments, we\u2019re not masking the tinnitus. We are eliminating the source of the tinnitus,\u201d Michael Kilgard of the University of Texas-Dallas, who worked on the study, said in a statement.

The Italian case concerned company director Innocenzo Marcolini who developed a tumor in the left side of his head after using his mobile phone for 5-6 hours a day for 12 years. He normally held the phone in his left hand, while taking notes with his right hand. Marcolini developed a so-called neurinoma affecting a cranial nerve, which was apparently not cancerous but nevertheless required surgery that badly affected his quality of life. He initially sought financial compensation from the Italian Workers\u2019 Compensation Authority INAIL which rejected his application, saying there was no proof his illness had been caused by his work. But a court in Brescia later ruled there was a causal link between the use of mobile and cordless telephones and tumors. Italy\u2019s supreme court rejected an INAIL appeal against that ruling on October 12 though its decision was only reported on Friday.

Chief among the concerns raised by doctors working in the Louisiana city is the death rate, which is twice that of New York and over four times that of Seattle, based on Thursday\u2019s publicly reported data. New Orleans residents suffer from obesity, diabetes and hypertension at rates higher than the national average, conditions that doctors and public health officials say can make patients more vulnerable to COVID-19, the highly contagious respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus. Some 97% of those killed by COVID-19 in Louisiana had a pre-existing condition, according to the state health department. Diabetes was seen in 40% of the deaths, obesity in 25%, chronic kidney disease in 23% and cardiac problems in 21%. Orleans Parish, which encompasses the city, reported 125 confirmed coronavirus deaths as of Thursday, the equivalent of 32 coronavirus deaths per 100,000 people. That rate for New York City was at 15.9 on Thursday. New Orleans could be a harbinger for the potential toll the pandemic could take in other parts of the South and Midwest that also have high rates of obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. A host of other factors could contribute to New Orleans\u2019 high death rate from COVID-19, ranging from access to healthcare and hospital quality, to the prevalence of other conditions, including lung disease, health officials say. But they also note that it is clear that obesity-related conditions are playing a role in the deaths. That could be a warning sign for the United States at large, where chronic obesity is more common than in other developed countries, they said. Hospitals are reporting cases across the generations -mothers and daughters, fathers and sons - being intubated and cared for in the same intensive care units, said Tracey Moffatt, the chief nursing officer at Ochsner Health, the largest healthcare provider in Louisiana. The prevalence of obesity, diabetes, hypertension and heart disease in New Orleans and Louisiana plays into that, she said. Those family members often suffered from the same medical conditions before becoming sick, leaving them similarly vulnerable to the coronavirus despite their age gaps. \u201cWe had a case where a mom was already in the ICU and the daughter, who was obese, came in,\u201d she said. \u201cThe daughter asked staff to wheel her by her mom\u2019s room so she could say goodbye before she herself was intubated. We knew the mother was going to pass away.\u201d  Both patients suffered from obesity. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week released for the first time a report showing that 78% of COVID-19 patients in ICUs in the United States had an underlying health condition, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease and chronic lung disease. The CDC report was based on a sample of under 6% of reported coronavirus infections, but doctors in Louisiana said it was consistent with what they are seeing, and it is in line with what other countries like Italy and China have faced. Those percentages, said Dr. Joseph Kanter, an emergency department doctor and the top public health official in New Orleans, are likely similar in cities across the United States. \u201cWhat we worry about here is that we have more people in our communities with those conditions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re more vulnerable than other communities, and the number of deaths we\u2019ve seen illustrates that.\u201d   The New Orleans metropolitan statistical area ranks among the worst in the United States for the percentage of residents with diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity, a Reuters analysis of CDC data shows. An estimated 39% have high blood pressure, 36% are obese and about 15% have diabetes. Nationally, the median is 32% with high blood pressure, 31% obese and 11% with diabetes. \u201cThe burden of disease in Louisiana and the Deep South is higher than in the rest of the country,\u201d said Gee. \u201cInvariably that means that the South is going to be hard hit by this.\u201d", "output": "Why is New Orleans' coronavirus death rate twice New York's?

Dr. Jonathan Rees, an expert in dermatology at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, said squamous cell carcinoma was not a big health worry. \u201cNon-melanoma skin cancer in man is very, very common and is almost 100 percent curable with an operation usually simpler than a tooth filling,\u201d Rees said in a statement.

The price drop was for retail pharmacy prescriptions, not medications administered in hospitals or doctor\u2019s offices. HHS experts said the last time retail prescription drug prices declined was in 1973, when they went down by 0.2%. The price drop comes amid questionable prospects for major legislation to curb prescription drug costs. Nonetheless, it was a nugget of decent news in a sobering, broader report on rising U.S. health care spending. The HHS report found that spending on prescription medicines at pharmacies accounted for 9% of the total $3.6 trillion national health care tab in 2018. Total U.S. health care spending grew by 4.6% last year, averaging $11,172 per person. In the real world, U.S. spending is concentrated on the sickest patients, with 5% of the population accounting for half of costs. Because of strong overall economic growth last year, health care spending as a share of the national economy declined slightly, from 17.9% in 2017 to 17.7%, the report found. Legislation pending in Congress to curb drug costs would mainly benefit older people on Medicare, who are the biggest consumers of medicines. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is forging ahead with a floor vote next week on her bill authorizing Medicare to negotiate prices for the costliest drugs, including insulin. Under her bill, private insurance plans would be able to get Medicare\u2019s prices as well. But President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress are solidly opposed to Medicare negotiations. Instead Trump is backing a bipartisan Senate bill that would require drugmakers to pay rebates to Medicare if they hike prices above inflation. As a candidate Trump had called for allowing Medicare to negotiate directly. Both bills would cap what Medicare recipients must pay annually in out-of-pocket costs for their prescriptions. The HHS report made no forecast of future prescription drug prices. It\u2019s unclear if the 1% price decline seen last year may be the beginning of a sustained trend or was merely a temporary pullback by drug companies getting pummeled by Trump and lawmakers of both parties. Thursday\u2019s report found that nearly 9 out of 10 prescriptions dispensed are for generic drugs, which puts downward pressure on prices. Even though prices of brand-name drugs increased more moderately, they still accounted for most of the spending on prescriptions \u2014 nearly 79%. The government\u2019s findings on prices for brand-name drugs dovetailed with  an analysis earlier this year by The Associated Press. In the first seven months of 2019, drugmakers raised list prices for brand-name prescription medicines by a median of 5%, the AP found. That was down from about 9% or 10% over those months the prior four years. The AP\u2019s findings suggest that an easing in drug prices may continue this year. Reducing prescription drug costs remains one of the top priorities for consumers.

Kevin Schiffman, a self-described \u201chealth freak,\u201d bought a can of Unreal chocolates for $20 during a recent trip to Whole Foods, opting to spend significantly more on the treats he plans to hand out to trick-or-treaters than last year. The treats, which are made from fair trade cocoa and cane sugar, puffed quinoa, and cabbage, carrots and beets for coloring, contain around 5 grams of sugar per serving, compared with over 20 grams for many traditional candy bars. In prior years, he said he handed out assorted chocolates like Reese\u2019s and Kit Kats, wary that health-minded people sometimes draw groans and eye-rolls from trick-or-treaters by giving out apples or toothbrushes. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t really much out there that you could choose from unless you\u2019re giving out fruit,\u201d said the 35-year-old Boston-area resident, who works in sales at WikiFoods, a Cambridge, Massachusetts, food company. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to get eggs on the house.\u201d  Xlear hopes to win over customers with its Sparx brand of candies that use xylitol, a fibrous sugar found in birch trees and corn cobs that it says is safe for diabetics and lower in calories than cane sugar. At the moment, they are only sold at health food stores and distributed to dental offices to give to kids as part of Halloween candy buyback programs, though the company is planning to expand, said Shad Slaughter, a consultant at Xlear. Kayco has introduced Chocolate Leather, a chewier, lower-sugar chocolate bar. \u201cWith the growing awareness of parents who would like their kids to eat less sugar, this is going to grow,\u201d said Glenn Schacher, a research and development specialist in New York who developed the product of Kayco  The Obama administration has pushed for food companies to include added sugar content on their labels, which has drawn sharp rebukes from the sugar lobby. For the moment, most Americans will still hand out candy and chocolates filled with sugar to trick-or-treaters on Saturday and use the holiday as an excuse to indulge. \u201cI can be a pig four times a year,\u201d said Tom Cardamone, a 46-year-old Brooklyn, New York, resident, who said he is not normally much of a candy eater. \u201cEvery holiday, I know it\u2019s candy, and I have my addictions.\u201d   Graphic on sugar demand over Halloween\u00a0link.reuters.com/fux85w", "output": "Spooked by sugar, Americans search for healthier Halloween treats.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "Save the Children said in a report released Tuesday saying that U.N. statistics show at least 280 million children are better off today. But it said a quarter of the world\u2019s children are still denied the right to a safe and healthy childhood, with youngsters fleeing or caught in conflict the most disadvantaged. Singapore tops the rankings as the country that best protects and provides for its children, followed by Sweden, Finland, Norway, Slovenia, Germany, Ireland, Italy, South Korea and Belgium. At the bottom were Central African Republic, Niger despite recent progress, Chad, Mali and South Sudan. The Global Childhood Report 2019 said the most dramatic progress since 2000 was among some of the world\u2019s poorest countries. Sierra Leone made the biggest improvements, followed by Rwanda, Ethiopia and Niger. The United States ranks 36th in the 2019 report, tied with China. It ranks just above Bahrain, Belarus and Kuwait and ahead of Bosnia and Russia, tied at 38. Carolyn Miles, president and CEO of Save the Children, said the report looked at eight indicators of a good childhood including child survival, education, child labor and early marriage and compared the year 2000 with 2018. \u201cThere has been remarkable progress if you look across the world,\u201d she said at a recent briefing on the report\u2019s finding. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing statistic\u201d that the indicators overall got better in 173 of 176 countries. Compared with 2000, Miles said there was a 49% drop in deaths of children under age 5, a 40% drop in child labor, a 33% drop in chronic malnutrition and stunting, and a 25% drop in child marriage. She said only one of the indicators rose \u2014 the number of children living in conflict or affected by violence \u2014 and it increased \u201cvery significantly.\u201d There was an 80% rise in children living in or fleeing conflict zones in the 2000-2018 period, Miles said, \u201cand today\u2019s conflicts last much, much longer.\u201d According to the report, an estimated 420 million children are living in conflict zones, more than double the number in 1995, and nearly 31 million children today have been forcibly displaced from their homes. Launched ahead of International Children\u2019s Day on June 1, the report said that in 2000, an estimated 970 million children were robbed of their childhood by events such as exclusion from education, malnutrition, sickness, violent death, child marriage and early pregnancy. That number today has been reduced to 690 million, it said, meaning at least 280 million children are better off today than they would have been in 2000. The report said this means that today there are 4.4 million fewer child deaths every year, 49 million fewer stunted children, 130 million more children in school, 94 million fewer children working, 11 million fewer child marriages and 3 million fewer teen births.", "output": "Child advocacy group: Kids in 173 countries better off now.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "The refugee influx started the day after Sunday\u2019s vote and since then dozens of people have been arriving at a time, said Irene Nakasiita, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross in Uganda.

Although numerous European countries have introduced stronger vaccination policies, stubborn pockets of vaccine refusal have fueled epidemics across the continent. Last month, the German government proposed making measles immunization mandatory for children and employees at kindergartens and schools; there have been more than 400 cases of measles in Germany this year.

Italy\u2019s national seismology institute said the quake had a magnitude of 4.8 on the open-ended Richter scale and 4.9 on the moment magnitude scale, which relates to the amount the ground slips. It struck north of Catania, the largest city in the eastern part of the Mediterranean island, but no damage or injuries were reported there. The quake opened up cracks in homes in several towns, sending chunks of concrete debris tumbling to the ground. It toppled a Madonna statue in a church in Santa Venerina and broke up sidewalks and a stretch of highway, forcing it to close. Many people spent the hours after the quake sleeping in their cars.

One 80-year-old man was safely extracted from the rubble of his home, ANSA said, while a woman told state radio that her sister was pulled out from under a heavy armoire that had toppled. A ceiling collapsed in another house, and in other homes parts of exterior walls crumbled. Some stone walls along fields and local roads crumbled. Etna, the largest of Italy\u2019s three active volcanoes, has been particularly active since July. In recent days, Etna\u2019s latest eruption has been shooting volcanic ash, heavy smoke and lava stones into the air, coating roads and homes nearby with ash. A new fracture has opened near Etna\u2019s southeast crater and lava has been flowing down an uninhabited slope.

Since 2015, the academy has grown its female membership from 25% to 32%. Earlier this year, its new class of inductees reached gender parity for the first time. In 10 of the 17 branches _ including directing, writing and producing _ more women were invited than men. But studies have also shown the industry isn\u2019t changing so much. Last year, just 8% of the top 250 films at the domestic box office were directed by women, a decrease of 3% from the year before, and below even the levels of 1998. To help urge on a new generation of filmmakers, the academy has been giving fellowships to young women aspiring to Hollywood. On Wednesday, Hudson awarded the fourth such fellowship, which includes a $35,000 grant, to Eliana Pipes, a Columbia University graduate currently studying theater at Boston University. In London on Friday, she will hand out a fifth fellowship. Researching \u201cLittle Women,\u201d Gerwig said, made her realize that the difficulties of being a woman getting a film made today aren\u2019t so different than those Louisa May Alcott faced publishing her novel in 19th century New England. \u201cWhat was astonishing to me was how parallel Louisa May Alcott\u2019s experience was to the experience of trying to get a film about women off the ground today. Her publisher didn\u2019t know that it was any good. And she didn\u2019t really think it was any good,\u201d said Gerwig. \u201cIt took other women saying they were interested in it, and I think that happens today in all offices.\u201d Dern was still buzzing from seeing \u201cLittle Women\u201d (to be released Dec. 25) just the day before. She said the production was plainly different than most. \u201cAs we\u2019re longing for change in all these areas, to show up on set, to show up in rehearsals and see that the space you created was not only incredibly embracing and collaborative and safe, but I saw women everywhere,\u201d said Dern, who plays Marmee March. \u201cI saw the choices you were making each day to lift up and support other female artists, collaborators, crew.\u201d Gerwig said those cast and crew decisions weren\u2019t based on anything but talent. \u201cFemale filmmakers, female storytellers, female collaborators, you hire them because they\u2019re the best ones,\u201d said Gerwig. \u201cThat\u2019s why you hire them.\u201d The male perspective of the industry, they collectively agreed, has given rise to some absurd myths about women, among them the \u201cdifficult\u201d actress, the \u201cemotional\u201d director or \u201cinfighting\u201d-prone females. \u201cHave you ever been on a movie set with a bunch of men?

Alzheimer\u2019s is the most common form of dementia, a brain-wasting disease which in 2010 was estimated to be costing the world $604 billion a year. The fatal disease affects 44 million people worldwide, with the number set to triple by 2050, the campaign group Alzheimer\u2019s Disease International says. Several big pharma firms including Roche, Eli Lilly, Merck & Co and Johnson & Johnson, are pursuing various approaches to get to the root cause of Alzheimer\u2019s and try to find treatments to halt its progression. Yet over the past 15 years, more than 100 experimental Alzheimer\u2019s drugs have failed in trial. Lovestone and other experts believe this may be because drug trials are conducted too late, in patients whose condition has already gone too far. A predictive test for use before people develop symptoms would help researchers select the right people for drug trials, and help show whether the experimental drugs are working. Previous studies have found that PET brain scans and tests of lumbar fluid can be used to predict the onset of dementia from people with a less severe condition known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), but these tests are expensive and invasive, so scientists are keen to develop a cheaper, simpler blood test. MCI includes problems with day-to-day memory, language and attention. It can be an early sign of dementia, or a symptom of stress or anxiety. Around 10 percent of people diagnosed with MCI develop dementia within a year. Apart from regular assessments to measure memory decline, there is currently no accurate way of predicting who will or won\u2019t develop dementia. For this study, published in the journal Alzheimer\u2019s & Dementia, Lovestone\u2019s team used blood samples from 1,148 people - 476 with Alzheimer\u2019s, 220 with mild cognitive impairment and 452 elderly controls without dementia. They were analyzed for 26 proteins previously found to be linked with Alzheimer\u2019s. The team found 16 of these 26 proteins to be strongly associated with brain shrinkage in either MCI or Alzheimer\u2019s and then ran a second series of tests to see which of these could predict which patients would progress from MCI to Alzheimer\u2019s. With this second series, they found a combination of 10 proteins capable of predicting with 87 percent accuracy whether people with MCI would develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease within a year. Experts in the field welcomed the results but said they should be replicated in larger studies before an Alzheimer\u2019s blood test could be rolled out for use in doctors\u2019 clinics. \u201cThe results reported today are interesting, but as the authors point out there is still a very large amount of work remaining until a usable blood test for Alzheimer\u2019s disease becomes available,\u201d said Adrian Pini of the MRC Center for Developmental Neurobiology at King\u2019s College London. James Pickett, head of research at the Alzheimer\u2019s Society, said the research \u201cdoes not mean that a blood test for dementia is just around the corner\u201d. \u201cThese 10 proteins can predict conversion to dementia with less than 90 percent accuracy, meaning one in 10 people would get an incorrect result,\u201d he said. \u201cAccuracy would need to be improved before it could be a useful diagnostic test.\u201d", "output": "Study paves the way for a blood test to predict Alzheimer's.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "The third-term Democrat touted past achievements and trumpeted a long list of policy initiatives, many of which he previewed in a series of announcements over the past month. Cuomo also stressed the need for fiscal restraint, with the state staring at a $6 billion budget gap, caused largely by soaring Medicaid spending. The agenda Cuomo outlined in the speech includes plans for expanding anti-discrimination protections in the state constitution, an overhaul for New York City\u2019s Penn Station and a proposed ban on foam food containers. Cuomo also outlined another ban that would cover marketing flavored e-cigarettes to children, initiatives intended to lower the cost of prescription drugs, guaranteed paid sick leave time for more New York workers and expanded universal pre-kindergarten. \u201cNew York at her best is the progressive capitol of the nation, and we must fulfill that destiny again this year,\u201d Cuomo said. Cuomo delivered his address at the Empire State Plaza Convention Center in downtown Albany to an audience of members of the Legislature and top politicians from around the state. The speech kicked off a legislative session running through June 2. The governor\u2019s address comes after several episodes of violence targeting Jewish people, including an attack by a man who stormed inside the home of a Monsey rabbi, Chaim Rottenberg, and stabbed five people at a Hanukkah celebration. Rottenberg delivered a blessing before Cuomo\u2019s address and called for tolerance. \u201cI will never forget the horror of that night,\u201d Rottenberg said. \u201cBut I will also never forget how we continue to celebrate after that day, how we continue to rejoice in the miracle of Hanukkah. I will never forget the resilience on display that night and in the following days, the resilience of Jewish people and the resilience of New York.\u201d Cuomo is proposing a new law targeted at domestic terrorism and said New York would be the first state in the U.S. to enact such legislation. The new law would apply to crimes in which at least one person died and victims were targeted by their race, religion and gender, among other topics. Cuomo called the attack \u201cintolerable\u201d and pledged the state won\u2019t stand for it. \u201cThey attacked me, and they attacked you,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cThese are the times, my friends, when New York state is called upon to lead to set a course for a troubled nation searching its way through the fog of confusion,\u201d he said. In a policy briefing book that accompanied his speech, Cuomo said his proposal to legalize marijuana would limit the sale of cannabis products to adults over age 21. But he only briefly mentioned his legalization proposal in his address Wednesday, to tepid applause. A similar proposal to legalize recreational marijuana failed last year among disagreements over funding and hesitation from suburban Democrats. Lawmakers instead scaled back penalties for possession of small amounts of marijuana and created a process for expungement. Cuomo has declared \u201cMaking Progress Happen\u201d as his slogan for 2020. But any progress will have to come while the state is grappling with a budget gap fueled by soaring Medicaid costs. Debate over how to handle the shortfall is expected to color virtually every policy debate this year. Hundreds of activists rallied in Albany demanding action on issues including the state\u2019s ambitious climate change goals. Cuomo called climate change the \u201ctranscendent threat of our times\u201d and proposed sending voters a $3 billion bond in November to fund a flood reduction and habitat restoration program he is calling Restore Mother Nature. \u201cBecause no economic strategy, no social justice reform, no education policy will be worth a damn if we don\u2019t have a planet to live on,\u201d he said. Cuomo has yet to share many details about his plans to address soaring costs of the Medicaid program, which serves over 6 million people. The governor called Wednesday for improved accountability in the Medicaid system, saying safeguards were needed to limit potential overspending on the program by municipalities. More details of how the administration plans to address the funding gap may have to wait for his budget proposal, expected in mid-January. Cuomo has cautioned against overspending while pledging not to raise taxes. That budget-conscious message could clash with more left-leaning lawmakers and advocates who want to balance the budget with new taxes on the wealthy. The governor\u2019s party has seen big political wins in recent years, even as some long-time Democratic incumbents have lost to more left-wing challengers. But Cuomo argued Wednesday true progressive politics must be grounded in \u201creality\u201d and champion results over rhetoric. Republicans, who have seen their clout diminish in Albany, say they will hold down spending and resist new taxes. Republican leaders including state GOP chairman Nick Langworthy criticized the governor for failing to address the budget deficit as well as a mounting debate over bail reforms enacted last year. Cuomo and other Democrats have signaled they are open to making changes to the statute. In his preview announcements over the past month, Cuomo has released proposals to ban untraceable guns, study high speed rail, allow liquor sales in movie theaters, require the use of American-made steel and iron on infrastructure projects and ease rules for prosecuting sexual assault involving intoxicated victims, among other initiatives.

No one in the city could be vaccinated against Ebola on Monday, WHO said. The U.N. health agency previously could trace more than 90% of contacts of infected people in Beni but now that figure is just 17%, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. Almost 50 \u201cnon-critical\u201d WHO staffers were evacuated to the city of Goma while 71 remain, spokesman Christian Lindmeier said. He said the violence is not directed at WHO or the Ebola response at large. Instead, Beni residents are outraged that rebels continue to carry out deadly attacks despite the presence of U.N. peacekeepers and Congolese forces. Some demand that the U.N. mission act or leave. The bodies of four young protesters were found near the U.N. base after Monday\u2019s attack, Kumbu Ngoma with Beni\u2019s military court told The Associated Press on Tuesday. Investigations continued into the cause of their deaths. Six Congolese soldiers were wounded by gunfire near the base, Ngoma added. Congo\u2019s President Felix Tshisekedi after an emergency meeting Monday decided to allow joint operations between Congolese and U.N. forces in Beni following the protests that also burned the town hall. Congo\u2019s military early this month declared a new offensive against Allied Democratic Forces rebels who have killed hundreds of civilians and security forces over the past few years in the mineral-rich northeast. After the U.N. mission in recent days was accused of inaction, it said it could not carry out operations unilaterally in a region where Congo\u2019s military is already active, and that it cannot participate in Congolese military operations without being invited. Any unrest in the region where numerous rebel groups are active hurts crucial efforts to contain the Ebola outbreak. The number of reported cases has been dropping, with zero cases recorded on several days this month.

Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., to raise a pet issue on MSNBC: antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The federal shutdown was limiting government\u2019s ability to track infection, she said. But then she pointed to a deeper issue: \"\"the overuse and ruination of antibiotics.\"\" An advocate for tougher requirements for farm use of such drugs, Slaughter told host Joy-Ann Reid that she\u2019s been \"\"trying to save antibiotics for persons \u2014 for human beings.\"\" \"\"Eighty percent of the antibiotics in this country are fed to livestock every single day, and it's creating a terrible problem of resistant bacteria,\"\" she said. Eighty percent is an awfully big number, and we were curious: Do livestock consume the bulk of the nation\u2019s antimicrobial drugs? It\u2019s an important question, because according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wide use of antibiotics in food-producing animals \"\"contributes to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in food-producing animals.\"\" Emergence of resistant bacteria means if you get infected with bacteria from the food you eat, it might be harder to fight that infection with antibiotics. Drug resistance may be contributing to higher hospitalization rates in the recent salmonella outbreak, for example, the Los Angeles Times reported. Here\u2019s how it works, according to the CDC: Ranchers give animals antibiotics, which kills off or suppresses susceptible bacteria, but allows antibiotic-resistant bacteria to thrive. Those resistant bacteria may be transmitted to people through the food supply, such as by eating undercooked salmonella-tainted chicken. Since the bacteria are resistant to some antibiotics, the infections may be harder to fight, causing \"\"adverse human health consequences.\"\" So CDC \"\"encourages and supports efforts to minimize inappropriate use of antibiotics in humans and animals.\"\" You\u2019re probably aware of this effort in humans \u2014 it\u2019s why doctors are discouraged from giving their patients antibiotics to treat nonbacterial infections such as cold and flu. Widespread use of antibiotics when they\u2019re not required helps bacteria develop defenses to the drugs in a sort of microscopic arms race. It\u2019s also the reason the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has asked farmers to phase out certain antibiotics important to human medicine when used merely to promote growth in animals. (The industry says this accounts for a small amount of antibiotic use. The FDA says it\u2019s hard to say.) So, back to the 80 percent number. It turns out it has been a popular talking point since 2010 among those who advocate for restricting use of antibiotics on farms. That\u2019s the year the FDA released newly required data on sales of antibiotics by manufacturers for food-producing animals. The FDA didn\u2019t release sales information on antibiotics for human use, but pointed to national projections from IMS Health, a Connecticut company that compiles proprietary health data. The numbers let folks compare the millions of kilograms of drugs sold by manufacturers for use by food-producing animals (13.1 million kilograms) in 2009 with those sold for use by people (3.3 million kilograms). The 13.1 million kilograms of antibiotics sold for animals was 80 percent of the total amount of drugs sold for both humans and animals, which was 16.4 million kilograms. We should note this comparison doesn\u2019t account for all antibiotics sold in the United States. For example, it doesn\u2019t count antibiotics sold for household pets. A researcher with the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health\u2019s Center for a Livable Future first did the math for a 2010 blog post that\u2019s been widely cited. (The most recent reports reveal a similar proportion, as calculated by the Pew Campaign on Human Health and Industrial Farming.) Pharmaceutical company lobby groups such as the Animal Health Institute, though, have cried foul. It says the number is \"\"wrong and misleading, for several reasons,\"\" and cites the FDA. The FDA has indeed offered a \"\"caution regarding comparisons of human and animal antibacterial drug sales data.\"\" It repeated some of those cautions in a 2012 letter to Slaughter herself. But while it offers a series of caveats about drawing \"\"definite conclusions\"\" from \"\"direct comparisons\"\" about the drug sales data \u00a0\u2014 \u00a0such as differences in dosages between different drugs and in the sizes of human and animal populations \u2014 it confirms both sets of sales data essentially measure the same thing. Both show the volume of antibacterial drugs, by weight, being sold to various outlets from the manufacturer. So, while they don\u2019t offer a direct estimate of human or animal use, they do offer a comparison of sales by manufacturers for both groups. In 2011, the FDA provided the IMS Health sales estimates directly to Slaughter, describing the sales numbers as \"\"a surrogate for human use to compare to antibacterial drug use in animals.\"\" We should note that about a third of the antibiotics used in food-producing animals are ionophores, a type not used in humans. (The agriculture industry argues this means they have nothing to do with antibiotic resistance in humans; Lawrence at Johns Hopkins says they may still contribute.) If you remove ionophores from the sales data comparison, the proportion of antibiotics that go to food-producing animals vs. humans drops to around 70 percent. There are also also plenty of limits, as the FDA points out, on the usefulness of the publicly released sales data to inform public policy on antibiotics on farms. They don\u2019t illuminate the reasons animals get the drugs (to promote growth? to treat infection? both?). They don\u2019t specify how the antibiotics are administered (injection? food?). The FDA\u2019s asking for comments on how it might release more of the information it collects from animal drug companies, and says it will update reports from previous years with that new data. That might include, for example, a detail it confirmed to Slaughter\u2019s office in a 2011 letter \u2014 that nearly all antibiotics reported for animal use to the FDA were delivered in food and water, as opposed to by injection. Meanwhile, the industry uses the current lack of detail to downplay the usefulness of the statistic, even as it fights efforts to gather and release more information. Sales data is \"\"not at all useful for understanding the benefits or the risks of using antibiotics to keep animals healthy,\"\" Ron Phillips of the Animal Health Institute told PolitiFact. Others disagree and argue that the data is actually quite revealing. \"\"There is some uncertainty in these data, but not enough to escape the fact that the vast majority of antibiotics in this country are used in food animals, not to treat sick people,\"\" wrote Robert Lawrence, a doctor who directs the Center for a Livable Future at Johns Hopkins. Slaughter, meanwhile, is sponsoring two bills, the Delivering Antimicrobial Transparency in Animals Act and the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act, to require more detailed monitoring and to limit the use of antibiotics to sick animals. Among those lobbying against both: the Animal Health Institute. Our ruling Slaughter said \"\"80 percent of the antibiotics in this country are fed to livestock.\"\" The statistic comes from a comparison of FDA sales data for food-producing animals and private sales data for humans since 2009 \u2014 not all antibiotics sold in the United States. A letter from the FDA to the congresswoman confirms that most of the drugs for livestock are consumed in food and water. That means the percentage \"\"fed\"\" to animals may not be quite as high as 80 percent, though it would be close. Slaughter could have said more clearly that of all the antibiotics sold for use by people and livestock, 80 percent are for animals. But she was close.\"", "output": "Eighty percent of the antibiotics in this country are fed to livestock.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "The 9-2 vote showed support among lawmakers for a modified version of legislation that has spurred heated debate. But the vote also showed division within the Assembly\u2019s Democratic majority. America\u2019s most populous state allows students exemptions from required vaccinations for medical reasons. But proponents of the bill calling for greater scrutiny of the exemptions argue that parents are shopping for unscrupulous doctors who will write one even if it is not necessary. Sen. Richard Pan, a Democrat from Sacramento and author of the bill, argued that greater oversight of medical exemptions is a matter of protection for children. \u201cCalifornia cannot allow a handful of unscrupulous physicians to put our children in danger,\u201d he told the Assembly Health Committee. But hundreds of people at the hearing urged lawmakers to vote against the bill. Critics argue Pan\u2019s legislation amounts to government overreach. \u201cIt takes the state government and puts it squarely in the middle of the doctor and patient relationship,\u201d said Leigh Dundas of the group Advocates for Physicians\u2019 Rights, which has recently bought Facebook ads targeting the legislation. Several parents told lawmakers they would not comply with the law. The five-hour hearing came to epitomize the heated debate around the bill. A packed gallery jeered, and some threatened Pan. Under the bill, the public health department would scrutinize doctors who grant more than five medical exemptions in a year and schools with vaccination rates of less than 95%. Officials say that threshold is needed to provide \u201ccommunity immunity,\u201d which protects those who haven\u2019t been vaccinated for medical reasons or because they are too young. The measure, which Gov. Gavin Newsom said he will sign if it reaches his desk, comes as measles cases have reached a 25-year high in the U.S. Lawmakers in other states also have been considering changes to confront the increase. Maine eliminated religious and philosophical exemptions, while New York lawmakers ended a religious exemption. Washington state halted most exemptions for the measles vaccine, though legislators in Oregon defeated a measure that would have made it harder for families to opt out. California\u2019s legislation has received national attention after actor Jessica Biel appeared at the Capitol last week to lobby lawmakers against the measure with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent critic of vaccination. Pan initially proposed requiring state health officials sign off on every exemption from vaccinations. But he dropped that requirement in the version of the bill that advanced Thursday. Among the provisions in the revised California legislation: \u2014 Doctors can\u2019t charge for filling out a medical exemption form or conducting a related medical examination. They would have to sign the forms under penalty of perjury. \u2014 California Department of Public Health doctors or registered nurses would review exemptions issued by local medical providers who issue five or more a year or at schools with high exemption rates. \u2014 The state public health officer, who is a doctor, could revoke any exemptions that don\u2019t meet national guidelines. \u2014 Parents could appeal to an independent panel of doctors. \u2014 Officials could consider families\u2019 medical histories in allowing exemptions in addition to immunization guidelines issued by federal medical authorities. Supporters said the legislation would permit exemptions for the less than 1% of students who should avoid vaccinations because they would have a severe allergic reaction or have impaired immunity from a liver problem, HIV, chemotherapy or other conditions. Assemblyman Rob Bonta, D-Alameda, praised the bill during Thursday\u2019s hearing as \u201cscience-based\u201d while still allowing robust medical exemptions. New figures show the rate of kindergartners with permanent medical exemptions has quadrupled since California banned personal exemptions, and more than 100 schools have medical exemption rates exceeding 10%. Public health officials have said they are stymied in investigating these cases because of a lack of oversight. The bill\u2019s backers argue its additional reporting requirements will help the state curb \u201cdoctor shopping\u201d and abuses of the exemption system. Still, critics questioned whether the measure would discourage doctors from writing exemptions at all.

Bourdain, 61, and Spade, 55, died three days and a continent apart this week amid a new U.S. report showing an uptick in suicides rates in nearly every state since 1999. Middle-aged adults \u2014 ages 45 to 64 \u2014 had the largest rate increase, according to the report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Previous studies have suggested economic downturns and the nation\u2019s opioid crisis contributed to the rise in middle-aged suicides. Dr. Christine Moutier, a psychiatrist and chief medical officer for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, said Friday it\u2019s important for everyone to know the warning signs and to intervene when family members, friends or co-workers appear troubled. Asking if they\u2019ve had suicidal thoughts is not harmful and lets them know you care, she said. Behavior that may indicate someone is suicidal includes: \u2014Talking about feeling hopeless, trapped, a burden to others or wanting to die. \u2014Unusual mood swings or withdrawing from family, friends and usual activities. \u2014Giving away important possessions. \u2014Increased use of alcohol or drugs. This week\u2019s report found that many suicides were in people with no known mental illness.

It\u2019s very troubling.\u201d Gordon said doctors need to ask patients at every opportunity about their mental health and evaluate their risk for suicide. \u201cWhen you ask everybody and not just people you might suspect, you double the number you detect,\u201d he said.

Ron Wyden highlighted the haphazard nature of the way food is purchased and provided to the school lunch program under a program known as USDA Foods. His point was simple: A lot of the food from one program in particular that ends up in school kitchens comes from points far away from the schools serving it. Using local sources of food might be cheaper, he argued, and it certainly would be more nutritious. Wyden offered an amendment that would establish pilot programs at five locations nationwide to see if using local food could be both cheaper and better. Wyden\u2019s amendment, which passed the Senate, would give school officials in five \"\"pilot\"\" areas far more flexibility in deciding where they purchase food. Right now, schools that agree to take part in the program, USDA Foods, are locked into a system that almost always forces them to purchase food from outside Oregon. That program is small, supplying only 20 percent of the food used in school nutrition programs but Wyden said the $11 million a year spent on it for Oregon schools should be used for food produced in Oregon. So he offered an amendment for give states and local districts more flexibility in navigating the USDA Foods system. The program offers a list of mostly bulk items that states purchase and then supply to local districts. According to a USDA description, \"\"Schools are ordering more bulk products that can be processed into kid-friendly items. \u2026 Decisions about what products schools order are not based just on the item\u2019s popularity but on its overall usefulness in meeting nutritional standards.\"\" Wyden\u2019s amendment would allow local officials, working in collaboration with state purchasing agents, more flexibility in where they can buy the food to overcome a system that brings most of the food to Oregon from other states. While small and limited, Wyden said it\u2019s important nonetheless and changing the program would bring extra dollars to the local economy while also providing more nutritious food. After it passed, the Oregon Democrat drove home the point in a news release: \"\"Oregon schools receive millions of dollars per year in federal school lunch assistance and yet they are required to spend that money almost anywhere but Oregon.\"\" That is the kind of statement PolitiFact Oregon can really chew on. There\u2019s no doubt that the federal government spends \"\"millions of dollars\"\" to pay for school meals in Oregon. That part of Wyden\u2019s statement isn\u2019t in doubt. But the second part made us wonder. Is it really  that most of the food purchased for Oregon schools under USDA Foods ended up with food from \"\"almost anywhere but Oregon?\"\" To answer, you have to dive into federal rules governing USDA Foods and some of the department\u2019s school food programs. It is a dense and complicated business that is as close as government gets to an extreme sport. Even the experts admit they don\u2019t always understand all the rules and requirements. Here's just one section:  \"\"At the beginning of each school year, State agencies shall establish the per meal rates of reimbursement for school food authorities participating in the Program. These rates of reimbursement may be assigned at levels based on financial need; except that, the rates are not to exceed the maximum rates of reimbursement established by the Secretary under \u00a7210.4(b) and are to permit reimbursement for the total number of lunches in the State from funds available under \u00a7210.4. Within each school food authority, the State agency shall assign the same rate of reimbursement from general cash assistance funds for all lunches served to children under the Program.\"\" Had enough? There\u2019s plenty more, but we\u2019ll spare you. The regulations run 65 pages. Wyden\u2019s spokeswoman Jennifer Hoelzer admitted her boss\u2019s statement was based on piles of \"\"anecdotal evidence\"\" derived from talks with school officials as well as those at the Agriculture Department because detailed records are hard to find. But we found some. The best is a spreadsheet compiled by David Jones at the Oregon Department of Education that was also shared with Wyden. It reveals that only seven food purchases out of 166 during the 2011-12 school year came from Oregon from the USDA Foods program. That\u2019s 4 percent for those of you who need help with the math. Cheese came from Missouri and Minnesota as well as other states. Oregon schools used meatless spaghetti sauce bought in Indiana, applesauce from Michigan and peanut butter from New Mexico. And then there was California, a  category killer that supplied Oregon schools with everything from peaches to salsa to something called \"\"Burrito, Beef & Bean Bulk\"\" and frozen strawberries. Forget Oregon cheese and strawberries, foodies. The only products bought from Oregon vendors were green beans, chicken fajita strips and frozen potato rounds. Are the schools \"\"required\"\" to buy out-of-state food if they choose to take part in USDA Foods? No. USDA Foods is voluntary. But most schools take part which means, as a practical matter, the answer is yes. Schools that take federal money for the nutrition must purchase their food through the USDA\u2019s program. And the rules governing the program almost guarantee the sale will be made out of state. So we conclude with records that all point in the same direction. Following federal procurement rules, which schools have to do to get federal money, leaves them little choice about what to buy and where to buy it, at least for USDA Foods. It\u2019s unknown whether the portion of out-of-state food is similarly lopsided for the entire school nutrition effort in Oregon. But for USDA Foods, the one definitive document we found shows unambiguous results -- 96 percent of food served in Oregon schools and purchased with federal dollars came from another state.

It\u2019s just that some foreign trading partners use their cheap labor and weak environmental and safety standards to sell cars, toys and widgets to Americans at prices that our domestic industries cannot match while, according to Brown, adopting policies that make it hard to sell America\u2019s goods abroad. So Brown was not saddened when negotiations for a South Korean trade deal went sour in November. After all, he said in a news release, more than 10 years of free trade deals have \u00a0\"\"brought a $2 billion per day trade deficit and the loss of millions of manufacturing jobs -- jobs that should go to Ohio's skilled workers.\"\" PolitiFact and The Plain Dealer expended plenty of bytes and ink on the lost-jobs issue during the election season, so there is no need to wade back into it here. Let\u2019s just say that a persuasive case can be made, although the underlying data on jobs is poor. This country can send a man to the moon but it cannot precisely quantify the number of jobs lost or gained to trade. But what about Brown\u2019s other point -- that more than 10 years of trade under the North American Free Trade Agreement and trade relations with China has resulted in a trade deficit of $2 billion a day? Causation of that kind is in dispute, and some experts and data suggest this country\u2019s reliance on oil plays a big role in the trade deficit, with OPEC countries selling $76.4 billion more to the United States than vice versa so far this year. But imbalances with China ($201 billion and counting so far this year) play a bigger role, government statistics show. We will not argue cause and effect here, nor will we tell you not to enjoy low-price consumer goods. We\u2019re merely examining the numbers. They show that the negative balance of trade went from $70.3 billion in 1993, just before NAFTA, to $378.8 billion in 2000, as the United States accepted permanent normalized trade with China, to a record high of $759.2 billion in 2006, according to Commerce Department records. So what of Brown\u2019s precise number, $2 billion a day? Brown is right -- kind of. Or he\u2019s not right, sort of. This drives us nuts too, but as we dug into the subject, we realized that different groups use different measures to describe the size of the trade deficit. You\u2019d think it would be as easy as comparing the value of goods and services exported from the United States with those imported from other countries. So let\u2019s show you some numbers from the Commerce Department using that exact measure. Trade deficit for 2007: $702 billion. For 2008: $698.8 billion. For 2009: $374.9 billion. The recession\u2019s effects were glaring, but even before then the trend was downward, albeit slightly. For January through September 2010, the most recent measurement available, the trade balance was a negative $379.1 billion. Assuming the monthly trends hold through December, this year\u2019s annual trade deficit should reach $500 billion. Divide that by the days of the year and you\u2019d have a daily trade deficit of $1.37 billion a day. That\u2019s 32 percent lower than Brown\u2019s claim of $2 billion a day. But since flush times will return eventually, imports and exports will presumably resume at robust levels, too. So if Brown was referring to the trade deficits that existed before the recession, his statement would be nearly accurate, because the deficit came to an average of $1.91 billion a day in 2008 and $1.92 billion a day in 2007. But it may not be that simple. Trade balances are affected not only by wages, tariffs and the demands of consumers, but also by events beyond the recession such as currency corrections and the value of the dollar. Considering recent currency corrections, annual trade deficits could stay in the range of $500 billion, said William Cline, a senior fellow at the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics. That would make Brown\u2019s $2 billion-a-day figure somewhat high. \"\"It\u2019s a bit of an outdated figure,\"\" Cline said.. Yet there\u2019s another way of viewing the data. Figures from the Commerce Department that we reviewed originated from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s economic analysis unit (a bureau within a bureau at Commerce). The figures are the government\u2019s official measure of the trade balance, used by the White House, cited in the news media and accepted broadly by economists. Yet the U.S. International Trade Commission, or ITC, which polices trade matters in the United States, maintains separate data that is used to review tariffs and trade practices. Depending on how one chooses to sort the data, a higher trade deficit can result. Brown\u2019s office told us that his data came from the ITC. So we, too, turned to the ITC, and its staff helped guide us in using its online database. The ITC cautioned that the official figures come from Commerce, but various trade professionals use ITC data to drill down further for other purposes. We drilled. The result: A much higher trade deficit -- as high as $500.9 billion last year, in the depths of the recession, and $800 billion -- averaging $2.19 billion a day -- for 2008. How can one agency have such different figures from another? It\u2019s easy. The ITC, concerned with tariffs, trade laws and trade policy, measures the value of goods -- cars, factory equipment, steel -- but not services. Services represent only a portion of the trade universe, yet they add a sweet spot to the equation. This country had a $132 billion trade surplus in services last year because it exported more in the way of travel, financial services, information services and so forth, than it brought in. Take away those services -- or just look at the ITC numbers -- and the trade balance becomes more bleak. It\u2019s important to remember that when the White House and news reports mention the trade deficit, they are including services as well as goods and relying on the Commerce numbers. Even the ITC stressed this with us. But Brown aides as well as representatives of Public Citizen, a liberal public interest group, and its Global Trade Watch project, say the ITC data can be more relevant in certain circumstances. A state like Ohio exports relatively little in the way of services, for example, so the ITC\u2019s focus on goods may be more pertinent for measuring trade\u2019s impact in Ohio, said Todd Tucker, research director for Global Trade Watch, and Chris Slevin, a Brown aide who previously worked as Global Trade Watch\u2019s deputy director. Even nationally, there is debate as to how much job-creating value can be found in export sectors like financial services and travel, Tucker said. Factories that make things employ a lot more people. Not to complicate this further, but ITC data can be sorted in yet another way, making the trade imbalance appear to be even worse. This occurs when some foreign-made goods are counted as \"\"imports for consumption,\"\" an ITC category with an assumption at the port of entry that the goods will be consumed in the United States. The problem occurs, critics say, when these \"\"imports\"\" wind up being shipped back abroad after being stored here temporarily. That gives them a new category on the way out -- \"\"re-exports\"\" -- which is not the same as a simple export of a product made in the United States. So they were counted as imports on the way in, but not subtracted back out as regular exports on their way out. This kind of counting, which defenders say has merit in certain circumstances, results in a higher trade deficit than when every product shipped in is counted as an import, and every product shipped out is counted as an export. By using these other categories in the ITC database, we calculated a trade deficit of $612 billion last year and a stunning $920.6 billion in 2008. These are close to the numbers Brown\u2019s office supplied to us initially, and they support his claim -- and then some. So which figure is right? It\u2019s a matter of legitimate dispute. Global Trade Watch says the larger numbers are more revealing and pertinent in a number of cases, especially when comparing U.S. trade relations with individual countries rather than the entire universe of global trade. The National Association of Manufacturers says that\u2019s nonsense. From \"\"time immemorial,\"\" the Commerce/Census data have been used, measuring the total value of goods and services in and the total value of goods and services out, \u00a0and that\u2019s the only valid way to count a deficit or surplus, said Frank Vargo, the association\u2019s vice president for international economic affairs. \"\"Inside U.S. Trade,\"\" a publication for trade policy wonks and attorneys, discussed this at length in a Nov. 12 article. It said that \"\"these different approaches result in widely different numbers when applied to both the global and bilateral deficits, and they have helped fuel and confuse a debate among stakeholders.\"\" Global Trade Watch is sticking to its guns, but so is the National Association of Manufacturers. So back to Brown\u2019s $2-billion-a-day claim: Is it accurate? Brown, who has authored a book on what he calls the \"\"myths of free trade,\"\" derives his figure from the ITC, and while the ITC cautioned us that the official balance-of-trade measure actually comes from Commerce, it is true that some authorities regard even the outlying ITC numbers as perfectly fine to use in certain circumstances. Yet even if we were to put those numbers aside and only use the Commerce Department numbers, Brown\u2019s figures were close to the mark before the recession. This year is not the best year to measure the normal effects of trade, and no one can predict the future; perhaps the trade deficit will stabilize at a lower number such as $500 billion a year, or $1.36 billion a day. Perhaps it won\u2019t. But based on the historical trends, regardless of which data source is used, we say Brown\u2019s claim is .\"", "output": "\"More than 10 years of free trade \"\"has brought a $2 billion per day trade deficit.\"", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "The furor, which erupted in Ireland last month and then spread quickly across Europe, has led to ready meals being pulled from supermarket shelves and damaged people\u2019s confidence in the food on their plate. It also raised concerns over food labeling and the complex supply chain across the European Union, putting pressure on governments to explain lapses in quality control. A fifth of adults said they had started buying less meat after traces of horse DNA were found in some products, according to the poll conducted by Consumer Intelligence research company. \u201cOur findings show that this scandal has really hit consumers hard, be it through having to change their shopping habits or altering the fundamentals of their diet,\u201d David Black, a spokesman for Consumer Intelligence, said. The online poll, conducted on February 14-15, questioned more than 2,200 adults on their spending habits following the horsemeat scandal. It gave no specific figures on how much meat people were buying, focusing only on broader trends. More than 65 percent of respondents said they trusted food labels less as a result. \u201c(Brands) will have to put in place really stringent ways of checking that what\u2019s being delivered and what\u2019s on the label is indeed what\u2019s in there,\u201d Black said. In the month since horsemeat was first identified in Irish beefburgers, no one is yet reported to have fallen ill from eating horse but many supermarkets and fast food chains are already struggling to save their reputations. Governments across Europe have stressed that horsemeat poses little or no health risk, although some carcasses have been found tainted with a painkiller given to racehorses but banned for human consumption. Environment secretary Owen Paterson, who met British retailers earlier in the day for talks on how to restore consumer confidence, said Britain was closely cooperating with European countries to investigate what happened. \u201cLooking ahead, there was absolute determination in the industry to restore confidence in their products,\u201d he said in televised remarks. \u201cWe look forward to meeting on a regular basis to absolutely make it clear that when consumers buy a product they get what they bought.\u201d  British retailers now expect the vast majority of tests on processed beef products to be completed by February 22, according to the British Retail Consortium. More than 60 percent of adults surveyed said they would now buy meat from their local butchers, the poll said, while a quarter of adults said they would now buy more joints, chops or steaks instead of processed meat. Michael Suleyman, who owns a family-run butchers\u2019 shop in Brixton, London, said more customers appeared concerned although for now there had not been any difference in sales figures. \u201cWe have seen people panicking and asking us lots of questions like \u2018where do you get your meat from?\u2019,\u201d Suleyman, 51, told Reuters. \u201cWe assure our customers by showing them the meat and mincing it for them in front of their eyes.\u201d  But with inflation running above central bank targets and an uncertain job market, the spending power of British consumers has been eroded in recent years and, for some, buying more expensive meat is not an option. Nearly a fifth of respondents said they wanted buy less processed meat such as ready-meals, but could not afford to. At a London branch of Britain\u2019s biggest retailer, Tesco, which found horse DNA in some of its own-brand frozen spaghetti bolognese meals last week, consumers were still buying meat products. \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing against horse meat,\u201d said Sean Cosgrove, 39, a local government employee. \u201cI think you\u2019re being ambitious if you expect top quality meat in those products anyway.\u201d", "output": "British shoppers saying nay to meat after horse scandal.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "\"The article reports that Avastin costs up to $55,000 per year.

This formulation, which appears in the abstract of the study, provides both absolute and relative risks. But ideally the report would have provided a more apples-to-apples comparison of absolute risk, stating that 12 percent of Avastin patients developed blood clots, compared to 8 percent of controls. The story earns an unsatisfactory rating, though, because it reports the findings incorrectly. The study shows the risk linked to Avastin to be 33 percent greater, not 30 percent. Further, the story fails to indicate the differences in risk for different types of cancers, which vary considerably. This is a significant omission. The story exaggerates the risks associated with the use of Avastin. The opening lines note the seriousness of the clots. The study notes a 12% incidence of venous clots in patients treated with Avastin\u2013yet fails to note that only about half required treatment. This leaves the reader with an incorrect belief about the true risk. By overstating the risks of serious blood clot, the story could leave patients who may benefit from treatment with an inaccurate impression of risk vs. benefit. The article is based on an analysis of previous research published in The Journal of the American Medical Association. The study author is quoted saying the results are more powerful than individual studies because it takes into account the results of 15 high-quality papers involving almost 8,000 patients. The story might have added that results of meta-analyses are often criticized, and rarely considered definitive, because they combine data from studies that used different methologies. This failure is significant in that it may add an undue degree of importance to the analysis. The article doesn\u2019t exaggerate the severity or prevalence of the cancers Avastin treats. The story cites the study itself, the lead author, a company spokesperson, and one independent clinician. This is adequate sourcing for a story of this length. The story mentions, at least briefly, that Avastin treats cancer via a different mechanism from traditional chemotherapies. But the story falls short of a satisfactory rating by mentioning, only at the end and very briefly, that most Avastin patients also use conventional chemotherapy\u2013and are therefore exposed to all of those side effects as well. This raises, but doesn\u2019t answer, the fundamental question of the overall benefit and overall risk of adding Avastin to treatment.

Specifically, the story discussed whether aspirin should get credit for \u201cbeating cancer,\u201d although there is nothing in the study about aspirin being a cure. To put the results in context, the story should have mentioned that the 10-year survival rates were 69 percent for those not taking aspirin and 74 percent for those who did take aspirin.

It also pointed out that a randomized controlled trial would be needed in order to actually prove that aspirin fights cancer.

The story did not discuss the prevalence or consequences of colorectal cancer, so we judge this criterion to be not applicable in this case.

The closest the story comes to mentioning cost is when it notes that one problem with the use of prescription sleep aids is that insurance may not cover long-term use; this would have been an obvious point at which to note how expensive these drugs can be. The story suggests that cognitive behavioral therapy can be effective after as few as two sessions, but it doesn\u2019t say how many sessions the average patient requires, how expensive those sessions are likely to be nor how likely it is that insurance would cover this type of therapy. The story notes that one study of cognitive behavioral therapy showed that it reduced chronic insomnia and helped patients function more effectively during the daytime for up to two years. However, it does not specify whether the relief from chronic insomnia meant that patients had no bouts of insomnia or simply had less prolonged instances of insomnia, nor does it quantify how much improvement patients experienced in daytime functioning. In its discussion of chemical sleep aids, the article provides no specifics about effectiveness; rather, it focuses on the mechanisms by which the prescription drugs encourage sleep. (For an example of how to provide more specifics, see this criterion in our review of the Times\u2019 story on this same data.) The article focuses on why many doctors now recommend cognitive behavioral therapy rather than drugs as the first-line treatment for insomnia. As such, it does an excellent job of laying out all the negative potential side effects of anti-insomnia drugs, both prescription and over-the-counter. Given the seriousness of these potential harms \u2013 including fatigue, sleep-walking and -eating, impaired balance and increased risks of falls and motor vehicle accidents and possibly even dementia \u2013 this careful discussion of harms\u00a0provides a valuable public service. Cognitive behavioral therapy does not appear to cause any harm, a point the story might have made more clearly, especially given that it describes the benefits as lasting for \u201cup to two years,\u201d which could lead some readers to assume that CBT stops working after a relatively short time. Nonetheless, overall, the article is more than adequate in its discussion of the harms of the two approaches. This story is not focused on one specific study, but it notes that the American College of Physicians reviewed 15 years\u2019 worth of scientific evidence before issuing guidelines recommending that drugs should be used to treat insomnia only if cognitive behavioral therapy has failed. More could have been said about how thorough the review was that contributed to the guidelines, and if there were any notable gaps in research that limit the findings. The story does not exaggerate either the frequency or the severity of insomnia. The story had several independent sources and we detected no conflicts of interest. The primary focus of this story is explaining why cognitive behavioral therapy is the better alternative for treating insomnia due to the negative side effects of insomnia drugs. The story also includes a great deal of practical information about \u201csleep hygiene,\u201d as well. The story notes that CBT can be provided by any trained therapist or nurse. The story could have been more\u00a0helpful if it had specified how common this training is and how a patient seeking CBT could go about finding a health care professional trained in the technique. The article also might have mentioned that systematic analysis of studies has shown that even web-based versions of cognitive behavioral therapy can effectively treat insomnia, making it even more widely available. The story\u00a0does not suggest that cognitive behavioral therapy is new. It does, however, refer to the relatively new (as of May 2016) American College of Physicians guidelines recommending cognitive behavioral therapy over drug treatment for insomnia.

Deep brain stimulation, the current treatment standard, can run anywhere from $30,000 to $70,000, according to various online cost estimates. There also may be additional costs incurred by those patients who have adverse effects. The story is long on description but short on numbers. Saying the treatment \u201chas had an immense impact on patients\u2019 lives,\u201d the story devotes quite a bit of print along with video footage to show rapid functional and quality-of-life improvements experienced by patients, focusing on one women who said her tremor \u201chas almost disappeared\u201d since she had the procedure in June. Video showing this patient before and after treatment\u2013including her attempts to write her name, trace a spiral and pour water from one cup to another\u2013do a great job of conveying the improvements. This is terrific news for this woman, but\u00a0we\u2019re not told how representative her experience\u00a0is of overall outcomes. Is she a best-case scenario? Middle of the road?

So it really is extraordinarily helpful for people,\u201d he says. In terms of study data, the story says researchers \u201cfound that the severity of essential tremor reduced significantly\u201d in patients who underwent the treatment as well as reported improvements in quality of life. But there are no figures. In fact, according to the study, patients experienced a 47 percent improvement in tremor scores, dropping from 18.1 points on a 32-point scale at baseline to 9.6 points three months after the procedure. That data should have been included. Also, the story should have spelled out that 56 patients received the treatment, versus 20 who experienced a fake procedure. Also worth pointing out: We don\u2019t know the meaning or clinical significance of a reduction of this magnitude in the total score. The story addresses adverse effects, and that\u2019s sufficient for a Satisfactory rating. We do wish the story had quantified the harms that were measured in the study. The fourth paragraph says the procedure \u201cbrings lasting side effects in some patients\u201d and later the story quotes a physician who is not involved in the research as saying, \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty high incidence of side effects.\u201d But nowhere do exact numbers appear. Rather than citing data from the study, the story quotes the physician as saying that \u201cover a third of patients actually experienced either gait disturbance or paresthesia,\u201d or numbness. This information isn\u2019t very useful because the story does not explain when these rates were measured. According to the study, three months after the procedure 36% of patients had gait disturbance and 38% had numbness. After 12 months, the numbers dropped, to 9 percent and 14 percent respectively. Also worth mentioning is that one patient was reported to have permanent diminished sensation of the dominant thumb and index figure, which was categorized as a serious adverse event. That did not appear in the story. The story clearly spells out that there isn\u2019t data on the long-term efficacy of this procedure, and that more study is needed, so we\u2019ll give this a barely passing Satisfactory. Several important\u00a0study limitations were not included in the story, such as the fact that the treatment did not provide significant improvement for some types of tremors, and the treatment is not appropriate for people who are unwilling or unable to undergo an MRI. We\u2019re also not told that the sham group was only followed for 3 months, while the experimental group was followed for a year. This is not usually recommended in clinical trials and both groups should be followed for the same length of time. The story cites a figure from the International Essential Tremor Foundation, an advocacy group, that an estimated 10 million people in the United States suffer from the condition. However, a 2014 analysis of existing research put the number of cases at around 7 million as of 2012, or about 2.2% of the U.S. population. While this may not qualify as disease mongering, the story could have pointed out that the exact number of cases isn\u2019t clear. Also, the story should have noted that not all people with essential tremor have symptoms severe enough to require treatment. The story only fulfills part of our criteria. It does use one independent source, a physician who was not involved in the study. It also accurately reports the trial\u2019s funding sources: InSightec, which developed the device; along with Focused Ultrasound Foundation, which is funded by device makers and philanthropic organizations; and the Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation, an Israel-U.S. government partnership that receives corporate support. However, the story falls short because it does not report the fact that nine of the study authors reported conflicts of interest, with most receiving financial compensation of some sort from device makers in the field. Lead researcher G. Rees Cosgrove, M.D. who is quoted in the story, reported receiving consulting fees from InSightec. The story states, \u201cDoctors usually treat essential tremor with medication, but the drugs don\u2019t work well for all patients.\u201d That\u2019s true, and so we\u2019ll give this a Satisfactory rating for at least mentioning alternatives. But it should be noted that other procedural treatment options were not compared or even mentioned in the story and received only a brief mention in one of the videos. The current standard for tremor patients who don\u2019t respond to medication is deep-brain stimulation, in which a probe connected to a pacemaker is implanted in the thalamus to suppress the tremors. Gamma Knife thalamotomy, which delivers precise doses of radiation to the thalamus, is also considered to be a safe and effective therapy for patients who don\u2019t respond to medication. Also, some patients have mild symptoms that can be treated with relaxation techniques and the avoidance of triggers such as caffeine. The story states that the device was approved by the FDA in July. The story could have done readers a service by giving a sense of how many medical centers around the country are geared up to perform the procedure, or will be soon. This is indeed a new treatment option for essential tremor, though the story may leave readers with the false impression that the concept of killing off neurons in the thalamus is new. Rather, it\u2019s the use of focused ultrasound to destroy brain tissue, rather than a probe inserted in the brain, that constitutes an advance.

The Kalamazoo is polluted with polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, from paper recycling mills. Used for ink removal, the chemicals were discharged into the river from the 1950s through the mid-1970s. They also seeped into groundwater and surface waters from landfills where mill waste was dumped. In addition to the river, the contamination zone in Allegan and Kalamazoo counties includes a roughly 3-mile (5-kilometer) section of a tributary called Portage Creek, as well as mill properties, riverbanks and floodplains. It is on the federal Superfund list of hazardous sites. Signs posted along the river warn anglers not to eat the fish they catch. The EPA has overseen the removal of nearly 450,000 cubic yards (344,000 cubic meters) of soil and sediment from the area since 1998, in addition to cleaning up 7 miles (11 kilometers) of the river and riverbanks. Eighty-two acres (33 hectares) of landfills containing PCBs have been covered with layers of clay, topsoil and vegetation to prevent the toxins from leaching into groundwater. But much remains to be done. The agreement between NCR and the government calls for the company to pay at least $135.7 million for cleanup work that is expected to take an additional 10-15 years. Among the tasks: dismantling Trowbridge Dam in Allegan County. The dam, which was built in 1898 to supply electric power to Kalamazoo, is in poor shape and has been over-topped by high water. It is the highest-priority dam removal planned in Michigan, according to the state Department of Natural Resources, which set aside $2.9 million in May to get the project underway. The first step is to stabilize the structure so that it won\u2019t collapse while a contractor dredges PCB-laced sediments from a 2.4-mile (3.9-kilometer) river section upstream, which is expected to take three years, said Paul Ruesch, the EPA\u2019s on-site coordinator. NCR funds will pay for that work and for razing the dam when the sediment removal is complete, Assistant U.S. Attorney General Jeffrey Bossert Clark told the AP. \u201cYou want to get that sediment out before taking the dam out, so you\u2019re not letting the sediments wash further downstream,\u201d he said. The removal of tainted soils in several floodplain spots is also funded under the deal. And the company will also pay $76.5 million to the EPA to cover past and future costs of the river cleanup; $27 million to other federal and state agencies for damages to natural resources; and $6 million to the state for past and future costs. The proposed settlement was filed in federal court Wednesday. The public will get 30 days to comment, after which the government agencies could make revisions before requesting final court approval. NCR spokesman Scott Sykes said the company had no comment. The agreement represents a significant milestone in the overall cleanup, which is expected to end up costing about $851 million, Clark said. Payment negotiations are continuing with other companies that share responsibility for the pollution, including Georgia-Pacific, International Paper and Weyerhaeuser. The Kalamazoo River project is among those on the Superfund list designated by the Trump administration for special attention because of cleanup delays, Irving said. \u201cThis settlement represents substantial progress in the cleanup and restoration of the Kalamazoo River,\u201d said Liesl Clark, Director of the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy. In addition to protecting public health and the environment, she said, it will fund \u201cprojects to restore natural resources and help compensate the public for lost recreational opportunities within this important Southwest Michigan watershed.\u201d While \u201cextremely welcome,\u201d the deal won\u2019t raise enough money to finish the cleanup and agencies should continue pressing the polluters to do more, said Kenneth Kornheiser, president of the Kalamazoo River Watershed Council, a nonprofit advocacy group. \u201cI appreciate the monumental size of the problem, but somebody created the problem and needs to be responsible for remediating the damage,\u201d he said. ___ Follow John Flesher on Twitter: https://twitter.com/johnflesher", "output": "Company to pay $245M toward cleanup of Kalamazoo River PCBs.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "The story does not discuss the costs or potential savings associated with the use of this drug.

Sure, vitamin pills cost only pennies a day, but treating everyone would cost billions of dollars a year. Assuming just a nickel a day for 400 IU of vitamin D (the dose used in this study), the cost of treating everyone in the U.S. would exceed $5 billion a year. That bill has to be compared to the expected benefits of supplements given to healthy people, which in this trial were not statistically significant, so those billions might just be flushed down the drain. As noted above, the body of the story makes clear that the results of this trial did not show a clear benefit from taking 400 IU daily. However, the headline and lead sentence both state that vitamin D might fight colds, something this trial failed to clearly demonstrate. We\u2019ll give the story the benefit of the doubt for what\u2019s in the middle, not at the top. The story cautions that vitamin D can cause problems including nausea, vomiting, constipation, poor appetite, weight loss and even higher blood pressure or heart rhythm abnormalities. This rating is a close call. The story notes the limitations of the study of vitamin D and winter colds, including the fact that there was no statistically significant difference in the main outcome measure between the treatment and placebo groups, that the study was small, and that the extent of any benefit was not clear. The story also does a nice job of providing readers with some background, including results of other recent trials, as well as recommendations and opinions of health agencies and experts. However, the cautionary notes in the body of the story are drowned out by the headline and the lead sentence that tout potential cold-fighting properties of vitamin D. Also, while the story says that 164 men took part in the trial, it fails to tell readers that 60 of them dropped out before the study was done and that the high number of drop-outs made it impossible for the researchers to determine if there was a statistically significant difference in absenteeism between the treatment and placebo groups. We\u2019ve made our point about the headline and lead, so we won\u2019t ding the story for that again in this criterion. But the grade could have gone either way for reasons noted. This story does not exaggerate the effects of common winter colds. Although this story refers to the findings of other studies and the recommendations of health agencies and experts, there is no identified independent source to comment on the trial. In their journal article, the researchers reported no potential conflicts of interest. It would have been helpful to tell readers that the trial was funded by the Medical Research Fund of Finnish Defence Forces, in order to distinguish this trial from studies funded by supplement manufacturers or others with a vested interest in the results. The story points out that experts generally recommend supplements only when people aren\u2019t getting enough vitamin D from their diet or sunlight. And as noted above, the story points out that supplements expose people to some risks of vitamin D toxicity. The availability of vitamin D supplementation is really not in question. There was no claim that there is anything new about tests of vitamin D for prevention of respiratory illness. This story missed the opportunity to explain what was different about this trial. In their article in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, the researchers pointed out that by studying military conscripts much of the variability that complicates population studies was filtered out. All the participants were from a narrow age group, had passed the same entry physical examination, lived in the same military housing, ate the same food, followed the same daily routines and so on. Also, the classification of their daily status (healthy or ill) was more uniform than would be expected in a study of people in varied civilian occupations. The strengths of the study would be expected to filter out much of the background noise that fogs typical population studies. It is notable that despite those features, this trial failed to reach statistically significant results (partly because of the high drop out rate, which the story should have mentioned.) One word usage nit: the story refers to military \u201crecruits,\u201d but the study participants were not recruited to join the military, they were performing mandatory service.

Unlike the LA Times, this story attached a number to the risk of complications observed during the study.

Notably, this story injected some caution into the discussion in the second paragraph, where it noted\u00a0that bypass outcomes are better with more experienced surgeons like the ones who conducted the study comparing bypass to the gastric band. Patients with different surgeons at a different institution might not fare\u00a0as well\u00a0with bypass\u00a0as the patients in this study. It also included comments from an expert who noted that the band may be a better choice for certain patients, such as those with a lower BMI or who don\u2019t have related medical conditions such as type 2 diabetes. Although it\u00a0included a closing caveat about the relatively short-term follow-up of these patients, which is an important limitation to point out, it could have done a bit better job of\u00a0explaining why this is important. Previous studies suggest that some band patients continue to lose weight for years and may approach the weight loss seen with bypass patients, whereas bypass patients may gain back some of the weight they lose initially. There may also be differences in the risk of very long-term complications (e.g. neurological disorders resulting from nutritional deficiencies after 5-10 years in bypass patients, versus failure of the device and need for reoperation with the band). No disease-mongering here. The story quotes an independent expert source and weaves his comments into the coverage nicely. Remarks from a second source would have been even better.

Authorities said Timothy Barr, 27, was a passenger in the car driven by his wife that was stopped by state troopers on a traffic violation. Troopers said they smelled a strong odor of marijuana and told Barr that gave them the legal right to search the vehicle even after he showed them his card authorizing the use of medical marijuana. Officers found small amounts of marijuana and residue and also found a loaded handgun under the driver\u2019s seat. Court records indicate that Barr cannot legally possess a firearm due to a prior conviction. In her ruling, Dantos said it was \u201cillogical, impractical and unreasonable\u201d for the troopers to suspect illegal activity once Barr showed them his medical marijuana card. She said Pennsylvania lawmakers never contemplated people with such cards being arrested and prosecuted for possession of marijuana in a package not clearly marked with a dispensary name. \u201cSuch actions are merely means of hampering the legalization of marijuana for medical purposes,\u201d Dantos wrote.

In addition, it said that \u201cpatients who received Rydapt in combination with chemotherapy in the trial went longer (median 8.2 months) without certain complications (failure to achieve complete remission within 60 days of starting treatment, progression of leukemia or death) than patients who received chemotherapy alone (median three months).\u201d The release effectively reports possible side effects experienced by AML patients receiving Rydapt, including \u201clow levels of white blood cells with fever (febrile neutropenia), nausea, inflammation of the mucous membranes (mucositis), vomiting, headache, spots on the skin due to bleeding (petechiae), musculoskeletal pain, nosebleeds (epistaxis), device-related infection, high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) and upper respiratory tract infection.\u201d\u00a0 It also warns women who are pregnant or breastfeeding to avoid taking Rydapt. It also points out that the FDA approved the use of Rydapt for other patients with \u201ccertain types of rare blood disorders\u201d and provides a list of possible side effects they might experience. The release explains that the approval follows the completion of a \u201crandomized trial of 717 patients who had not been treated previously for AML.\u201d\u00a0 It would have been better if the release would have added how many patients were screened with the diagnostic test to identify the 717 patients studied. While it appears this treatment prolongs survival, it isn\u2019t clear from the release what the time frame is, meaning people may live longer but still may die in the end of the disease. And while the release states that there are almost 20,000 patients diagnosed with AML each year in the US, it doesn\u2019t state how many may have this mutation and thus be potentially treated with this new therapy. According to a review article published last year, \u201cApproximately 30% of patients with AML carry the FLT3 mutation, which is associated with aggressive disease, with poor prognosis and a high risk for relapse.\u201d That means that most patients with AML will not be eligible for this treatment but the release could give the general public the impression that it will help most patients with AML. There is no evidence of disease mongering here. AML is a life-threatening condition and new agents that can prolong life are clearly needed. There\u2019s plenty of context about the disease and how the drug works: \u201cRydapt is a kinase inhibitor that works by blocking several enzymes that promote cell growth. If the FLT3 mutation is detected in blood or bone marrow samples using the LeukoStrat CDx FLT3 Mutation Assay, the patient may be eligible for treatment with Rydapt in combination with chemotherapy.\u201d The release doesn\u2019t mention who funded the research leading to the approval, although some readers might be able to guess that Novartis Pharmaceuticals, the manufacturer of Rydapt, and Invivoscribe Technologies, the makers of the LeukoStrat CDx FLT3 Mutation Assay, sponsored the trials since the approval was given to them. The new medication was used in combination with standard chemotherapy. That tells us the alternative was standard chemotherapy alone, an important comparison. While the release doesn\u2019t specifically state the availability of the drug, the FDA approval for its use suggests that it should start to become available in a matter of months and not years. The release makes clear that the use of this drug for AML patients with the FLT3 mutation is a new approach for a situation where previous therapies have been marginally successful. It also claims that the\u00a0drug is \u201cthe first targeted therapy to treat patients with AML, in combination with chemotherapy,\u201d according to an FDA official.

The emotionally charged ad focuses on an Ohio couple, Chris and Lauren Glaros, talking about raising their daughter, Grace, who was born with a spinal defect. \"\"When I saw Donald Trump mock a disabled person, I was just shocked,\"\" Lauren Glaros says in the ad, produced by Priorities USA\u00a0Action. Last fall, Trump was broadly criticized for appearing to physically mimic New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski at a campaign rally in South Carolina on Nov. 24. Kovaleski has arthrogryposis, a congenital condition which limits the movement of his joints. The ad shows a photo of the reporter, whose right hand is sharply angled at the wrist. The ad cuts to a video clip of Trump at the rally. \"\"You gotta see this guy,\"\" says Trump, wildly flailing his arms, his right hand flopping at an odd angle as he shouts in a weird, agitated voice: \"\"Ahh, I don\u2019t know what I said! Ahh, I don\u2019t remember!\"\" \"\"When I saw Donald Trump mock somebody with a disability, it showed me his soul, it showed me his heart. And I didn\u2019t like what I saw,\"\" the father, Chris Glaros, adds. The TV ad (which you can watch in full at the bottom of this fact-check)\u00a0is airing in seven crucial swing states -- Colorado, Ohio, Nevada, Virginia, Florida, New Hampshire and Iowa. PolitiFact is fact-checking the obvious question: Did Trump mock the man\u2019s disability? But first, we want to separate Trump\u2019s parody of the reporter from the reality. Kovaleski is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter who speaks with a normal voice and doesn't wave his arms around. (Watch a video of Kovaleski talking about his ground-breaking reporting on the murder cases against former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez.) Trump tweeted about the ad on Sunday: \"\"Clinton made a false ad about me where I was imitating a reporter GROVELING after he changed his story. I would NEVER mock disabled. Shame!\"\" The Trump campaign did not respond to PolitiFact\u2019s request for comment. PolitiFact also contacted Kovaleski, who declined comment. Here\u2019s why Trump singled out this reporter. At the time of the November rally, Trump was taking heat for his widely debunked claims that he watched in Jersey City, N.J., as \u00a0\"\"thousands and thousands of people were cheering\"\" the collapse of the World Trade Center following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. To defend this account, Trump seized on a Sept. 18, 2001, story by Kovaleski -- who then worked for the Washington Post -- and another reporter. Near the bottom of the story, they wrote that \"\"law enforcement authorities detained and questioned a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding tailgate-style parties on rooftops while they watched the devastation on the other side of the river.\"\" But the reporters couldn\u2019t verify the celebrations actually occurred. \"\"I certainly do not remember anyone saying that thousands or even hundreds of people were celebrating. That was not the case, as best as I can remember,\"\" Kovaleski later told the Washington Post Fact Checker. Remember, Kovaleski wrote that \"\"a number of people\"\" -- not thousands -- were allegedly seen celebrating. This why Trump, believing that Kovaleski was backing off the 2001 story, wailed in his impersonation, \"\"Ahh, I don\u2019t remember!\"\" Trump\u2019s behavior sparked public outrage. The New York Times rebuked Trump in a statement: \"\"We think it's outrageous that he would ridicule the appearance of one of our reporters.\"\" Colleagues and friends defended Kovaleski. \"\"@sergenyt is one of the best reporters \u2014 and best people \u2014 I know. This is despicable,\"\" ESPN reporter and author Don Van Natta Jr. wrote on Twitter. People who share Kovaleski\u2019s condition -- formally known as arthrogryposis multiplex congenita or AMC -- and their families launched a social media campaign with the hashtag \"\"AMCStrong.\"\" Trump denied making fun off the reporter\u2019s disability. \"\"I merely mimicked what I thought would be a flustered reporter trying to get out of a statement he made long ago,\"\" he said in a statement at the time. \"\"I don't buy that. (Trump) clearly was mocking his disability,\"\" said Julie Reiskin, executive director of the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition, an advocacy group, when we asked her about it. \"\"That was very, very obvious, because he disagrees with all kinds of people at other times, and he doesn't use that voice or wave his arms like that.\"\" Reiskin stressed that she was just giving her view of how Trump acted, because her nonprofit group can't endorse or oppose any candidate. Reiskin said Trump\u2019s rally display \"\"portrays people with disabilities as incompetent. That if you can't control your speech or part of your body that you're not competent, which is very destructive\"\" to the image of disabled people facing stereotypes and discrimination, she added. U.S. Senator Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican, recently withdrew his support for Trump after Trump said an Indiana-born federal judge of Mexican descent was incapable of fairly presiding over a class-action lawsuit against Trump and his defunct Trump University. But Kirk also referred to Trump\u2019s comments. Kirk suffered a serious stroke in 2012 and uses a wheelchair after years of rehabilitation. \"\"Donald Trump\u2019s latest statements, in context with past attacks on Hispanics, women and the disabled like me, make it certain that I cannot and will not support my party\u2019s nominee for president,\"\" Kirk said. During the rally backlash, Trump insisted in a statement he couldn\u2019t have known the man was disabled because \"\"I have no idea who this reporter, Serge Kovaleski is, what he looks like or his level of intelligence. \u2026 Despite having one of the all-time great memories I certainly do not remember him.\"\" Kovaleski countered that as a reporter for the New York Daily News in the late 1980s and early 1990s he regularly covered Trump. He told the Washington Post he was sure the businessman remembered him -- and his condition. \"\"Donald and I were on a first-name basis for years,\"\" Kovaleski told the New York Times. In fact, Kovelski recalled spending the day with Trump in 1989 when the reporter and other journalists flew with the billionaire on the \"\"inaugural voyage\"\" of the Trump Shuttle airline. \"\"Flying out of La Guardia, we spent a big chunk of the day flying up and down the east coast with Trump chatting with me and the others on the plane,\"\" Kovaleski told the Daily News. He added that a furious Trump called the next day and screamed at him\"\" because Kovaleski had reported that the Trump Shuttle took off late on its debut flight after Trump had run many ads saying it would be the most on-time airline in the industry. The Daily News story looking back at Kovaleski\u2019s history with Trump included an archived image of his bylined Trump Shuttle story (\"\"Wings of Don\"\") with a photograph of Trump cutting a ceremonial ribbon. In addition, Trump spoke familiarly about Kovelski at the rally, calling him a \"\"nice reporter.\"\" He also described him as \"\"the poor guy\"\" and indicated he knew Kovaleski\u2019s appearance (\"\"you gotta see this guy\"\") before launching into his imitation. Still, the candidate repeatedly denied knowing the reporter. \"\"Serge Kovaleski must think a lot of himself if he thinks I remember him from decades ago -- if I ever met him at all, which I doubt. He should stop using his disability to grandstand and get back to reporting for a paper that is rapidly going down the tubes,\"\" Trump said, getting in a shot at the New York Times, in a statement. Our ruling In an ad from Priorities USA Action, parents of a disabled child said Trump \"\"mocked\"\" a disabled reporter at a campaign rally. Trump did mimic the man\u2019s oddly angled right hand while flailing his arms and shouting in a strange voice. Disabled people and advocates\u00a0said the candidate clearly was mocking him. Trump\u2019s excuses for his comments are at odds with the evidence. Trump said he didn\u2019t remember the man so he couldn\u2019t know he was handicapped. But Kovaleski said he and Trump knew each other well because the reporter regularly covered the New York businessman for years. Archived reports support that. Trump also talked about the reporter with familiarity as a \"\"nice reporter\"\" and a \"\"poor guy\"\" who \"\"you gotta see.\"\" Trump\u2019s denials that he did not mock -- or even know -- the disabled reporter don\u2019t add up.", "output": "\"Priorities USA Action Says Donald Trump mocked \"\"someone with a disability.\"", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "As this is not an available treatment, the cost was presented as something not yet known. The story suggested that the cost for the pill would likely be something less than $17/month \u2013 the cost for its component medications. The story did not provide a rational for why the expected costs would be less than the costs for the individual medications on their own. Nonetheless, it tried to address cost. The benefits of treatment in terms of blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, and anti-clotting were presented However, it is premature to present an estimate for the reduction in heart attack and stroke as the time frame of the study presented is much too short to inform us as to whether this is the case. There was no discussion of harms of treatment beyond a statement that the side effect rates for the polypill were the same as for the medications individually. While this was what was observed in the current 12 week trial, the reader should have been reminded of the short term nature of the study, the limited demographics of the study population, and that conclusions, although informed by the common long-term use of the component medications, still require analysis of the effects these medications may have in individuals who may not have all of the underlying conditions being treated. Although the story did an adequate job of describing the results of the study, it did not confine itself to discussion of the observed outcomes but chose to focus on extrapolating the results to what might be the longer term benefit. Stating that this pill could \u2018cut a person\u2019s risk of heart disease and stroke roughly in half, the study concludes\u2019 implies that the pill was tested for its effect on cardiovascular outcomes, when in fact it has only been shown to reduce risk factors levels in a single, short-term study. This is misleading. The story did not engage in overt disease mongering. Quotes from a number of clinicians involved in the current study, and individuals who were supportive or critical of the current treatment approach were included in this story. While the story failed to mention options other than the use of multiple pharmaceuticals to lower risk of heart attack and stroke, \u00a0it did touch on the use of the drugs separately rather than in combined form. The story made clear that the combination pill discussed was experimental, while at the same time indicating that all of its components were available as generic medications.

The release only gets as detailed on cost as the excerpts below: The findings, which support earlier research demonstrating positive results of the assessment and treatment method in a university setting, have the potential to transform dental care for high-risk patients at a lower cost to both patients and dental clinics and practices. Results appear online Jan. 22, 2018, in Advances in Dental Research. The authors said now that this has been shown to be effective in a non-academic clinical setting, there also is potential for insurance companies to reimburse CAMBRA and other preventive therapies for adults, thereby lowering patient costs while increasing profits for dental practices. The release also doesn\u2019t address the cost of prescription fluoride toothpaste which may actually result in higher costs overall. The number needed to treat was 4, meaning\u00a0that you would have to treat 4 people for one additional person to get benefit. This results in the cost of therapy being multiplied by 4 to get the effect found in the study. The release described benefits this way: Among 242 patients (137 intervention, 105 control) initially identified as high risk for caries, only a quarter of the patients remained at high risk in the CAMBRA group at 24 months, while just over half (54 percent) of the control group did. Of the 192 low-risk participants (93 intervention, 99 control), most participants remained low risk. As noted under Evidence criteria below, the release listed as a limitation the fact that only about one-third of the patients who started the study completed the 24 month checkup. There is no mention of harms. We are given enough information to judge the quality of the evidence; it was a randomized study with an experimental and a control group. The release also deserves praise for noting study limitations, including the high study attrition rate (65 percent of volunteers dropped out before their 24 month follow-up). The study quality seems to have been very good considering the difficulty in performing this type of community based study. The blinding was adequate and although the published study states that the\u00a0blinding was \u201cdouble\u201d (patient and investigator), it also appears\u00a0that the treating dentists (participating treaters) were also blinded to the group that the patient was assigned. This could\u00a0have been mentioned, too, and would have strengthened the release. There is no disease mongering. The funding sources are listed, and there are no apparent conflicts. In the strictest possible way, the release does not directly talk about all the different ways of preventing dental caries. But we were glad that the release discussed the improvements that happened for some patients in the control group who received fewer products. We are glad the release talks about possibly following up on this, in case the lesser products could still benefit many patients. Excerpt: The researchers said the risk reduction among the control group may have been caused by the fluoride toothpaste enhancing tooth repair, as well as the mouth rinse enhancing saliva flow and having bactericidal effects. While not as significant as the CAMBRA group in this study, the risk level of these patients dropped more dramatically over time than for those in the 2012 UCSF CAMBRA study. It was surprising to see the benefits gained by the control group,\u201d Rechmann said. \u201cMore research is needed to see if the products and treatment administered to this group function in the way we speculate, and if so, they might be made easily available to dental patients. Doing so can change the whole picture of caries control. This CAMBRA method is available at about half of US schools and colleges of dentistry according to the release. However, the prescription fluoride toothpaste is available from most pharmacies. The release clearly explains that this research began in 2002, and small incremental steps in its validation have been published over many years. This is one more step.

During a September speech in Alabama, Trump had\u00a0called for a boycott of the National Football League (NFL), saying: Wouldn\u2019t you love one of the NFL owners when someone disrespects our flag, \u2018get that son of a bitch off the field right now\u2019 . . . If you see it, leave the stadium, I guarantee things will stop. Trump\u2019s words heightened emotions on both sides of the issue, but for athletes and team owners, it seemed to heighten solidarity and even spread the protest to as quarterback Tom Brady and National Basketball Association players Steph Curry and Lebron James\u00a0spoke out against Trump. Amidst all this, a lengthy open letter to the President purportedly penned by astronaut and former NFL Player Leland Melvin came to light: To Donald Trump I believe in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of this country even though at the time they were drafted, their tenets of life, liberty justice for all and eventual freedom of speech, religion, assembly, press and petition amendment ratified in Dec 1791, only applied to a select group of people and not ones that looked like me. Donald Trump I listened to your Alabama rally rant and could not believe how easily you say what you say. We have become numb to your outlandish acts, tweets and recent retweet of you knocking down Hillary Clinton with a golf ball that you hit. Donald Trump your boorish and disgusting actions are not funny. They actually promote violence against women especially when your followers act out what you say. I used to walk the grounds of UVA in Charlottesville, VA as a graduate student only to watch in horror as those same grounds became a battlefield being trod by Nazi and anti-Semitic worshippers armed with assault style weapons ready to fight to make America White again. (their words). You actually said there were nice people on both sides. People armed and ready to kill other Americans for the purpose of eradicating Blacks, Jews, Hispanics, Mexicans, Asians, Latinas and even the first real Americans, Native Americans to make America Great Again were \u201cnice people\u201d? Verses what you say in condemnation of an unarmed black man peacefully protesting by exercising his constitutional First Amendment rights by silently taking a knee is appalling, unnerving and reprehensible. You called Colin Kaepernick \u201ca son-of-a-bitch.\u201d And said he should be fired. You are basically calling his white mother a bitch. The strong contrast in language for a black man and a Nazi is very telling. Do you have any sense of decency or shame in what you say to the American people that are part of your duty to serve respectfully with dignity, presidentially? The National Anthem that we listen too has been edited to try not to offend because when Francis Scott Key penned the song he watched freed slaves fighting for the British and wrote this stanza: \u201cAnd where is that band who so vauntingly swore, That the havoc of war and the battle\u2019s confusion A home and a Country should leave us no more? Their blood has wash\u2019d out their foul footstep\u2019s pollution. No refuge could save the hireling and slave From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave, And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave O\u2019er the land of the free and the home of the brave.\u201d I guess if I were a slave back then I probably would have done anything to obtain freedom from my American oppressors who were whipping, killing, raping, dismembering, hanging or releasing the dogs on people like me all under our Constitution. In 1814 former slaves fought with the British for their freedom from their American enslavers and Key witnessed a battle from a ship off the Maryland shore at Fort McHenry which inspired him to write what became our National Anthem. I served my country not in the military but as 1 of 362 American Astronauts that have explored the universe to help advance our civilization. Not just Americans but all humans. I also was briefly in the NFL and stood for the National Anthem with my hand over my heart. What makes us great is our differences and respecting that we are all created equally even if not always treated that way. Looking back at our planet from space really helps one get a bigger perspective on how petty and divisive we can be. Donald Trump maybe you should ask your good friend Mr. Putin to give you a ride on a Soyuz rocket to our International Space Station and see what it\u2019s like to work together with people we used to fight against, where your life depends on it. See the world and get a greater sense of what it means to be part of the human race, we call it the Orbital Perspective. Donald Trump please know that you are supposed to be a unifier and a compassionate and empathetic leader. If you can\u2019t do the job then please step down and let someone else try. I pray that you do the right thing. May God bless you.

Some may have also questioned the authenticity of the national anthem stanza mentioned by the former NFL Player (it is indeed part of the song).

The article does not mention comparative costs for other ways of managing the medical conditions these drugs treat. The news article does not quantify the potential benefits of treatment with heartburn or antacid drugs. They are very effective in preventing acid-related disease. An additional sentence or two might help readers weigh their pros and cons. The article provides balanced information about the frequency and seriousness of one potential harm of taking antacids\u2014hip fractures. Most other research has turned up relatively minor side effects (e.g. gastrointestinal discomfort, diarrhea), though a 2005 study suggested that these drugs might make people more susceptible to virulent clostridium difficile infections that produce dangerous watery diarrhea. Though the article ably employs a quote by Dr. Alan Buchman to explain the chief limitation of the study\u2019s design\u2014that it cannot prove cause and effect, and that the patients simply may \u201chave some other problem that increases the risk of fractures\u201d\u2014the story could have stated more clearly the drawbacks inherent in a retrospective study of a large patient database. There are no obvious elements of disease mongering. Hip fracture is common and often devastating. As the article suggests, it is the final insult on the slope toward death for one in five people. It dispatches another one in five to nursing homes for the rest of their lives. However, the article provides information only on relative risk of hip fractures, not their absolute risk. The very large relative risks cited may overstate the absolute risk of these medicines, even if there is a true risk of fracture. The news article reports the funding source for the study, cites three sources\u2014the study\u2019s author, an academic gastroenterologist, and a spokeswoman for the manufacturer of Prevacid\u2014and provides adequate information to judge their potential conflicts of interest.

It suggests two potential solutions \u2013 either \u201csimply to consume more calcium,\u201d or to take the drugs in lower doses. Unfortunately, it fails to note that there is conflicting research to support the calcium-blocking hypothesis or that there is little research to show that calcium consumption can offset the increased risk of fracture among people taking antacids. More importantly, the article could have offered three additional recommendations: (1) all patients may not need to take these medicines on a regular basis; (2) lifestyle and dietary changes\u2014cutting back on caffeine, alcohol, cigarettes, and acidic foods\u2014can also help; and (3) some patients taking one class of drugs known as proton pump inhibitors (e.g. Nexium, Prevacid, Prisolec) could safely switch over to another class known as histamine blockers (e.g. Zantac) that were associated with fewer hip fractures in this study. Histamine blockers have a very safe long-term record (20+ years). Most readers are likely to know about heartburn drugs or antacids that suppress the production of gastric acid. They are, as the LA Times says, \u201camong the most widely used in the United States.\u201d Some of these medicines are also available over-the-counter without a prescription, potentially useful information omitted from the news article.

Newly elected Congressman Dave Joyce watched the hour-long oration on the House of Representatives floor with his House and Senate colleagues and was up the next morning to discuss it with radio talk show host and Plain Dealer columnist Mike McIntyre on WCPN\u2019s \"\"The Sound of Ideas\"\" call-in program. The Russell Township Republican told McIntyre he heard plenty of familiar themes in Obama\u2019s speech, and said many of the president\u2019s solutions to problems \"\"seemed to involve more big government.\"\" But Joyce said he was intrigued by Obama\u2019s call for providing high school students with a more technical education that will help them get better jobs after graduation. During the speech, Obama highlighted a school in Brooklyn, N.Y. that graduates students with both a high school diploma and an associates degree in computers or engineering. \"\"We need to better prepare our workforce for the jobs that we have,\"\" Joyce said. \"\"There are three million jobs that go vacant each month in this country, so the idea of trying to better prepare our children for the workforce by reforming high schools and stressing technical degrees in engineering, that is something that intrigues me. It\u2019s something that people in other districts hear from their people, who said we have difficulty finding competent workers.\"\" PolitiFact was intrigued by Joyce\u2019s assertion that three million U.S. jobs go unfilled every month. Could that be  that a nation with a 7.9 percent unemployment in January, 2013 actually has so many job openings? Joyce\u2019s press secretary referred us to monthly job openings reports produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. A Feb. 12 report that covered statistics from December 2012 said there were 3.6 million job openings on the last day of the year, a number that varied little throughout 2012. The report said that during 2012, hires totaled 51.8 million and separations totaled 50.0 million, yielding a net employment gain of 1.8 million. Reports the office issued for previous months in 2012 indicated there were 3.8 million job openings in June, 3.7 million job openings in November, October , July, \u00a0\u00a0May and March, \u00a03.6 million openings in September and August, 3.5 million vacancies in January and February, and 3.4 million unfilled jobs in April,  So why are there so many unfilled jobs? Employers maintain there\u2019s a skills gap, while some labor economists say that skilled workers desire more pay than employers want to provide. A Bloomberg.com article on the subject said U.S. companies have reported more than 3 million job openings every month since February 2011. The article quoted Anthony Carnevale, who heads the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce in Washington, D.C., saying there\u2019s a demand for workers with highly specific skills. The article described a growing skills gap as a global problem, quoting a McKinsey Global Institute study that said employers worldwide could face a shortage of 85 million high- and medium-skilled workers by 2020. It also highlighted a Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center program that helps unskilled workers train for better paid, skilled jobs in fields such as nursing. \"\"\u2018Qualified\u2019 used to mean a high school degree,\"\" Carnevale told Bloomberg. \"\"Now the qualification level has gone up so they\u2019re pressing for better people.\"\" A Nov. 11 segment on CBS News\u2019 \"\"60 Minutes\"\" said that manufacturers nationwide say the lack of skilled workers is the reason for hundreds of thousands of unfilled jobs. But it quoted management professor Peter Capelli of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School of Business saying that if companies paid better, they might be able to get the higher skilled workers they say they need. \"\"This is a market. And so, you know, if you're not willing to pay more, don't expect to get better quality people,\"\" Capelli said. \"\"One of the things we know now is wages are not going up. In fact, they've been stagnant and some cases even declining over time. So where is the shortage?\"\" Capelli also noted that a generation ago, companies provided workers with the training they needed. \"\"Companies are now saying, for all kinds of reasons, \"\"We're not going to do it anymore,\"\" Capelli told \"\"60 Minutes.\"\" \"\"And maybe they're right, they can't do it. But what they probably can't do is say, \u2018We're not going to do it, and it's your problem. It's your problem to provide us with what we need, Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer. You need to pay for this for us.\"\" Alcoa Inc. CEO Klaus Kleinfeld provided a counterpoint to Capelli\u2019s views. Kleinfeld said he believes manufacturing jobs pay \"\"very, very well,\"\" and that Alcoa is making efforts to fill the skills gap as are many other businesses.

The article\u2019s republishing coincided with an American missile strike retaliating against\u00a0a chemical attack by the Syrian government on civilians in rebel-held Khan Sheikhoun three days earlier. The Daily Mail article reported having evidence of an impending \u201cfalse flag\u201d attack. (A so-called \u201cfalse flag\u201d is a common conspiracy theory that asserts governments initiate crises \u2014 real or fabricated \u2014\u00a0to lay the groundwork for unpopular actions such as confiscating guns, or, in this case, removing a president from power.) Conspiracy web sites claimed the reason for the article\u2019s deletion was \u201cunclear,\u201d implying that forces intent on hiding a nefarious plot to oust Syrian president Bashar al-Assad pressured the publication to do so. The Daily Mail article, originally published 29 January 2013, reported that U.S. officials had told a British defense company they had been given a \u201cgreen light\u201d for chemical weapons use in Syria that could then be blamed on Assad: Leaked emails have allegedly proved that the White House gave the green light to a chemical weapons attack in Syria that could be blamed on Assad\u2019s regime and in turn, spur international military action in the devastated country. A report released on Monday contains an email exchange between two senior officials at British-based contractor Britam Defence where a scheme \u2018approved by Washington\u2019 is outlined explaining that Qatar would fund rebel forces in Syria to use chemical weapons. Barack Obama made it clear to Syrian president Bashar al-Assad last month that the U.S. would not tolerate Syria using chemical weapons against its own people. The idea that the chemical attacks in Syria had been disguised to look like Assad\u2019s work, thus giving\u00a0his adversaries cover to remove him from power, is a pervasive conspiracy theory that has been disseminated by the Assad-allied Russian government. On 11 April 2017, RT, a Kremlin-funded media outlet, quoted President Vladimir Putin airing that same claim: Russia has information of a potential incident similar to the alleged chemical attack in Idlib province, possibly targeting a Damascus suburb, President Vladimir Putin said. The goal is to discredit the government of Syrian President Assad, he added. \u201cWe have reports from multiple sources that false flags like this one \u2013 and I cannot call it otherwise \u2013 are being prepared in other parts of Syria, including the southern suburbs of Damascus. They plan to plant some chemical there and accuse the Syrian government of an attack,\u201d he said at a joint press conference with Italian President Sergio Mattarella in Moscow. Damascus denied the allegations, noting that the targeted area may have been hosting chemical weapons stockpiles belonging to Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) or Al-Nusra Front jihadists. But Truth Theory and other sites that re-posted the old Daily Mail story failed to note that the article wasn\u2019t deleted due to pressure from an evil globalist cabal, but instead was taken down because the publication admitted it was untrue. The Daily Mail\u00a0apologized to officials of Britam Defence and paid damages for libel after admitting the \u201cleaked e-mails\u201d were actually forged by a hacker. One of the fake e-mails read: Phil We\u2019ve got a new offer. It\u2019s about Syria again. Qataris propose an attractive deal and swear that the idea is approved by Washington. We\u2019ll have to deliver a CW to Homs, a Soviet origin g-shell from Libya similar to those that Assad should have. They want us to deploy our Ukrainian personnel that should speak Russian and make a video record. Frankly, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea but the sums proposed are enormous. Your opinion? Kind regards David Carter-Ruck, the law firm that represented the defense company, wrote in its Autumn 2013 newsletter of the case: The Mail\u2019s allegations were based on emails said to have been sent between two Britam directors, which had been published on the internet after Britam\u2019s computer systems had been illegally hacked. In fact, however,the emails were forgeries. They had been fabricated and published online by the hacker, whose activities remain the subject of a number of criminal investigations. Faced with these facts, the Mail accepted that the allegations it had published were completely false. In addition to publishing a prominent apology on its website and in the High Court, the Mail paid the company and the two directors \u00a3110,000 in libel damages, together with their legal costs The 18 April 2013 Daily Mail\u00a0apology read: An article on 29 January reported allegations on the internet that the US Government had backed a plot to launch a chemicals weapons attack in Syria and blame it on the Assad regime.

They described a series of experiments that suggest that people and their canine companions have mutually developed this instinctual bonding mechanism in the thousands of years since dogs were first domesticated. Sometimes called the \u201clove hormone,\u201d oxytocin is made in a brain structure called the hypothalamus and secreted from the pituitary gland. It is involved in emotional bonding, maternal behavior, child birth, breast-feeding, sexual arousal and other functions. \u201cOxytocin has many positive impacts on human physiology and psychology,\u201d said Takefumi Kikusui, a veterinary medicine professor at Japan\u2019s Azabu University, whose research was published in the journal Science. In one experiment, dogs were put in a room with their owners. The researchers tracked their interaction and measured oxytocin levels through urine samples. People whose dogs had the most eye contact with them - a mutual gaze - registered the largest increases in oxytocin levels. The dogs also had an oxytocin spike correlating with that of their owner. The researchers conducted a similar experiment with wolves, close relatives of dogs, and found that no such thing happened despite the fact that the wolves had been raised by the people. In another experiment, the researchers sprayed oxytocin into dogs\u2019 noses and put them in a room with their owners as well as people the dogs did not know. With the female dogs, and not the males, this increased the mutual gazing between dogs and their owners and also led to an oxytocin increase in the owners. \u201cI personally believe that there is a tight bond between the owner and dogs,\u201d Kikusui said. \u201cI have three standard poodles. I strongly feel the tight bonding with these dogs. Actually, I participated in the experiment, and my oxytocin boosted up after the eye gaze, like 300 percent,\u201d Kikusui added.

Ideally, the article would have also mentioned the costs of over-the-counter options to provide a comparison point. Even with a Q&A format, articles about allergies can be more useful by making sure to include relative and absolute rates of benefit from various treatments. This article leaves the readers with the idea that all or most people get relief from one or more of the triad of treatment approaches: avoidance of allergy triggers, OTC or prescription drugs like antihistamines and nasal steroids, and immunotherapies like allergy shots. But drawbacks\u00a0and side effects should be made clear, so that the true benefit is more accurate. For example, while the article does note that successful immunotherapy often takes years, it doesn\u2019t report: The article duly notes the most common side effect of the newer sublingual drops treatment and the rare risk of serious side effects from allergy shots. The article could have been strengthened by including information on the side effects of OTC and prescription drug treatments. The article relies on the credentialed expertise of an allergy specialist, and the \u201cAsk the Expert\u201d format means it\u2019s mostly a \u201creview\u201d of best practices and what\u2019s available therapeutically. The interview subject makes allusions to trial data (\u201csignificant decrease\u201d of symptoms, follow-up period) without giving information on the quality of the studies. This story didn\u2019t disease monger;\u00a0allergies are certainly a common affliction. But, while this isn\u2019t enough to lose the Satisfactory rating, there was what we call \u201ctreatment mongering\u201d because of the emphasis on immunotherapy for treatment. Most people won\u2019t\u00a0need this level of treatment,\u00a0and will do well with standard OTC and prescription medications. The format clearly excludes independent sources commenting on what the expert is saying. The interviewee himself might have quoted another source or two and strengthened his information, but overall, N/A seems reasonable. The article does a pretty good job of explaining alternatives to the relatively new immunotherapies, as well as some treatment cost comparisons. As stated earlier, the discussion was weighted toward immunotherapy and not OTC and prescription medications. The report makes clear what\u2019s FDA approved and what\u2019s not; and where to get the latest immunotherapies, and where people cannot get them. Good job on this.

Danone buys a range of dairy ingredients from Fonterra, but is one of its biggest customers for milk powder, according to analysts who cover the sector. Fonterra, which said it would contest the suit \u201cvigorously\u201d, declined to give details on its sales to the French firm. Danone has said that Fonterra supplied about 16 percent of the milk ingredients for its baby food business, which accounts for 20 percent of its total revenue. In August, Fonterra said it had found a potentially fatal ingredient in a range of products sold by multinational companies. After recalls were issued across nine countries including China, the scare turned out to be a false alarm because the ingredient was found to contain a less harmful bacteria. In a statement, Danone said it was starting proceedings in the New Zealand High Court against the world\u2019s largest dairy processor, as well as arbitration proceedings in Singapore to bring all facts to light and obtain compensation. The company said it was also terminating its supply contract with Fonterra and would make any further collaboration contingent on a commitment by Fonterra to full transparency and compliance with Danone\u2019s food safety procedures. \u201cThis affair illustrates serious failings on Fonterra\u2019s part in applying the quality standards required in the food industry,\u201d Danone said. Danone told Reuters it would source products from other firms, without elaborating. Other potential suppliers could include Glanbia, which is building a new milk powder plant in Ireland, and Arla Foods, which recently told Reuters it has \u201cmassively benefited\u201d from a desire by milk powder buyers to diversify supply after the food safety scare and a drought last year highlighted the risk of over-reliance on one supplier. Some dairy brands in China, for example, have started to look to diversify. Glanbia and Fonterra\u2019s much smaller competitors in New Zealand would not comment on whether they had seen more business from Danone as a result of the dispute. Arla was not immediately available. Danone\u2019s decision to halt purchases may be an effort to distance itself from the source of the perceived problem. \u201cIt\u2019s all about trying to rebuild their brand,\u201d said an analyst, who added that Danone was unlikely to face any supply interruption. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a panic decision today. They\u2019ve been looking at (diversifying) since the minute it happened.\u201d  Danone has a cushion, the analyst said, since the sudden, sharp drop in consumer demand means there is a large amount of product that still needs to be sold. Fonterra, a farmer-owned co-operative, has denied any legal liability to Danone regarding the recall. \u201cFonterra has been in ongoing commercial discussions with Danone and is disappointed that they have resulted in legal action,\u201d the company said in a statement. Shares in Fonterra\u2019s trading fund closed down 1.7 percent, while Danone shares were down 0.7 percent at 1245 GMT. The two sides started negotiations in October, after Danone recalled its Dumex formula products in China, where demand for foreign branded infant formula is high due to a series of domestic food quality issues. It is a key growth market at a time of sluggish demand in Europe. Eight companies issued product recalls in August. Danone is the first to take legal action against Fonterra. In December, Fonterra said it had reached agreements to compensate six firms and that it was \u201cvery, very close\u201d to an agreement with an affected nutritional company. New Zealand\u2019s largest company controls roughly one-third of global dairy exports and is a major wholesale supplier of milk powder used in milk formula and other food products marketed by Danone, Nestle and other multinationals. A big court settlement in Danone\u2019s favor would hurt Fonterra\u2019s bottom line given that it has already slashed its earnings and dividend forecast on the back of rising production costs at a time when it is struggling to keep up with soaring demand for milk powder. \u201cA large fine of the magnitude that Danone ... has stated would have a material impact. You\u2019d have to either remove your dividend or address your capital structure,\u201d said Rickey Ward, head of equities at Tyndall Investment Management in Auckland. Ward said that given strong global demand for dairy products, particularly from China, Fonterra was unlikely to have problems finding new buyers to replace cancelled orders. \u201cIt\u2019s not nice to lose a big customer ...

Michele Bachmann blasted her fellow Minnesotan Tim Pawlenty after he questioned her experience. The two are competing for the Republican nomination for president. \"\"These are serious times that require serious solutions -- not more of the same. Being right on the issues is critical -- it is what the American people demand. Executive experience is not an asset if it simply means bigger and more intrusive government,\"\" Bachmann said in a prepared statement on July 24, 2011. \"\"Governor Pawlenty said in 2006, 'The era of small government is over... the government has to be more proactive and more aggressive.' That's the same philosophy that, under President Obama, has brought us record deficits, massive unemployment and an unconstitutional health care plan.\"\" We wanted to see if Bachmann was correct about what Pawlenty said about small government, as it seems like a sentiment unlikely to be popular in a Republican primary. We contacted both campaigns for comment but didn't hear back from either one. We were able to easily find the comment; it originated with an August 2006 report in the\u00a0Minneapolis Star Tribune. (We found it in the Nexis newspaper database.) \"\"Pawlenty sees his role as reformer,\"\" says the headline. \"\"The GOP governor has targeted what he calls excessive corporate power. Critics call his election-year 'populism' cosmetic.\"\" The story says that starting in 2006, Pawlenty \"\"repeatedly made himself a nuisance to major industries that frequently back Republicans,\"\" particularly calling on Congress to put new regulations on prescription drug companies and auto makers. The story said he called for a two-year ban on advertising prescription drugs, urged regulators to speed the release of generic insulin products and proposed new regulations to support the use of ethanol. \"\"Those kinds of proposals for government intervention in the free market on the surface might seem unusual coming from a conservative GOP politician. But they are illustrations of the way that Pawlenty, a fiscal and social conservative, also styles himself a kind of latter-day trust buster, a reformer who is unafraid to challenge big business and wield government power to correct imbalances in the marketplace,\"\" the story said. And here's the key section:  \"\"The era of small government is over,\"\" Pawlenty said in an interview with the Star Tribune. \"\"I'm a market person, but there are certain circumstances where you've got to have government put up the guardrails or bust up entrenched interests before they become too powerful ... Government has to be more proactive, more aggressive.\"\" ...  Pawlenty insists his own populist streak is no election-year attempt to steer toward the middle. Peel back the conservative, he said, and you find the boy who grew up near South St. Paul's stockyards and learned what happened when power became too concentrated. When companies gain too much power, he said, they can suppress wages. Drug companies can command high prices for brand-name products long after they could have gone generic. Oil companies can use their muscle to keep out renewable fuels. HMOs can shift costs from their members to the public at large. While he may not fit the DFL [Democratic-Farm-Labor Party] definition of a populist, Pawlenty said, \"\"it's a matter of where you draw the line. ... I know that concentrated power unchecked leads to bad things,\"\" he said. We're not sure what Pawlenty's own reaction to the story was, but his press secretary didn't like it. The next day, the\u00a0Star Tribune\u00a0ran a \"\"clarification,\"\" that said the story \"\"quoted Gov. Tim Pawlenty saying 'The era of small government is over,' a comment he made in reference to a point made in a 2004 column by\u00a0New York Times\u00a0columnist David Brooks. Pawlenty spokesman Brian McClung said Monday that Pawlenty's record shows he is not a supporter of 'big government' and that he was 'simply talking about the need for government to be more effective and active.'\"\" The\u00a0Star Tribune\u00a0story doesn't mention David Brooks, but we went searching for the relevant story, and it seems likely it was a story Brooks wrote for the\u00a0New York Times Magazine\u00a0that took the measure of the conservative movement in 2004, headlined \"\"How to re-invent the G.O.P.\"\" In the story, Brooks noted that historical forces like Islamic extremism and the end of socialism were changing the nature of conservatism, pushing it away from a minimalist vision for government. The new conservatism \"\"understands the paradox that if you don't have a positive vision of government, you won't be able to limit the growth of government. If you can't offer people a vision of what government should do, you won't be able to persuade them about the things it shouldn't do. If the Republican Party is going to evolve into a principled majority party, members of this group are going to have to build a governing philosophy based on this insight,\"\" Brooks wrote. Brooks said George W. Bush typified this new approach. \"\"By the time he began his campaign for president in 1999, Bush understood that the simple government-is-the-problem philosophy of the older Republicans was obsolete. During that campaign, Bush criticized what he called the 'destructive mind-set: the idea that if government would only get out of our way, all our problems would be solved. An approach with no higher goal, no nobler purpose, than \"\"Leave us alone.''' Instead, Bush argued, 'government must be carefully limited but strong and active.'\"\" Pawlenty maintains that he was incorrectly quoted in the Star Tribune story. In May 2011, he went on Rush Limbaugh's radio show, and Limbaugh asked him if he had indeed said, \"\"The era of small government is over.\"\" \"\"The other side has pushed that falsely for a number of years,\"\" Pawleny said, according to the show's transcript. \"\"What happened is in the\u00a0Minnesota Star Tribune\u00a0-- not exactly a conservative publication -- I made reference to an article that David Brooks wrote which was entitled, 'The Era of Small Government is Over.' I didn't say those words myself; I was referencing his article. \"\"The very next day, the\u00a0Star Tribune, after a big battle, printed a clarification or a correction in their correction page,\"\" he continued. \"\"Of course, the main article was on page one and the correction was buried in some footnote in page three, but that incorrect quote has haunted me -- and I'm glad I had a chance in this big national forum on your great show to clarify, because if you go to the next day's newspaper you'll see the clarification in the\u00a0Star Tribune.\"\" We should note that the headline of the Brooks' article we found was not \"\"The Era of Small Government is Over,\"\" but we won't quibble about that. Pawlenty could have seen the article or another one like it somewhere with a modified headline, and the phrase certainly captures the article's sentiment. We also contacted the\u00a0Star Tribune\u00a0to see if it still stood by the story. The story's author, Patricia Lopez, is now the newspaper's political editor. Here's what she said: \"\"The governor was quoted correctly, which is why we printed only a clarification. He was quoting a David Brooks column, but as you can see, it was in support of other statements he made about the role of government. He never asked to have any other statement in the article corrected.\"\" But even if Pawlenty was quoting Brooks when he said the phrase \"\"the era of small government is over\"\" during the interview, he seemed to be doing so approvingly. The rest of the article portrays Pawlenty as someone who was willing to use government to intervene in the markets and gives examples to support that. Here's a little more from the story. \"\"Oil companies have played a role in suppressing the development of alternative fuels,\"\" Pawlenty said, with heavy-handed contracts that prevent gasoline stations from providing pumps for renewable fuels such as ethanol. With the nation's economic security at stake, \"\"that is disproportionate power,\"\" he said. \"\"Government has to step in.\"\" Similarly, when he testified before Congress for reimportation of drugs from Canada, where prices are government-regulated, Pawlenty said he got a taste of the pharmaceutical industry's might. \"\"I've seen it firsthand,\"\" he said. \"\"They've got a power that would frighten most citizens.\"\" Pawlenty has changed positions on energy policy; he once supported a cap and trade system\u00a0but no longer does. We looked for any recent statements he's made about reimporting drugs from Canada, but couldn't find any. We also asked two political watchers in Minnesota if the\u00a0Star Tribune\u00a0story was generally reflective of Pawlenty's political views in 2006. They said it was. \"\"In terms of his views on government, I think he can best be described as actively wanting to use the government to achieve certain ends, only with less taxes,\"\" said David Schultz, a professor at Hamline University who studies Minnesota politics. Schultz said Pawlenty's rhetoric became more conservative starting around 2008, when his name was mentioned as a potential running mate for John McCain. \"\"In fairness, Pawlenty did restrain spending by the Democratic Legislature. But he was more moderate on several other issues than he now appears, and the (Star Tribune\u00a0story) is an example of that,\"\" said Steve Schier, a professor of political science at Carleton College. So where does this leave us? Back in 2006, Pawlenty was portraying himself as a conservative who was willing to intervene in markets, and he said that government has to \"\"bust up entrenched interests before they become too powerful.\"\" It appears he's been backing off those positions in 2011, but that doesn't change what his views were years ago. If he was quoting David Brooks when he said \"\"the era of small government is over,\"\" he seemed to be doing so approvingly, though a spokesman said he did not mean to imply that he supported \"\"big government.\"\".\"", "output": "\"Michele Bachmann Says Tim Pawlenty said in 2006, \"\"The era of small government is over... the government has to be more proactive and more aggressive.\"", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "The story mentions that the Internet-based program is a \u201clow-cost\u201d option for treating insomnia; however, nothing more specific regarding cost is provided.

It\u2019s laboratory research only, nowhere near ready to be tried in a pregnancy. But it suggests that scientists might alter DNA in a way that protects not just one baby from a disease that runs in the family, but his or her offspring as well. And that raises ethical questions. \u201cI for one believe, and this paper supports the view, that ultimately gene editing of human embryos can be made safe. Then the question truly becomes, if we can do it, should we do it?\u201d said Dr. George Daley, a stem cell scientist and dean of Harvard Medical School. He wasn\u2019t involved in the new research and praised it as \u201cquite remarkable.\u201d \u201cThis is definitely a leap forward,\u201d agreed developmental geneticist Robin Lovell-Badge of Britain\u2019s Francis Crick Institute. Today, couples seeking to avoid passing on a bad gene sometimes have embryos created in fertility clinics so they can discard those that inherit the disease and attempt pregnancy only with healthy ones, if there are any. Gene editing in theory could rescue diseased embryos. But so-called \u201cgermline\u201d changes \u2014 altering sperm, eggs or embryos \u2014 are controversial because they would be permanent, passed down to future generations. Critics worry about attempts at \u201cdesigner babies\u201d instead of just preventing disease, and a few previous attempts at learning to edit embryos, in China, didn\u2019t work well and, more importantly, raised safety concerns. In a series of laboratory experiments reported in the journal Nature, the Oregon researchers tried a different approach. They targeted a gene mutation that causes a heart-weakening disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, that affects about 1 in 500 people. Inheriting just one copy of the bad gene can cause it. The team programmed a gene-editing tool, named CRISPR-Cas9, that acts like a pair of molecular scissors to find that mutation \u2014 a missing piece of genetic material. Then came the test. Researchers injected sperm from a patient with the heart condition along with those molecular scissors into healthy donated eggs at the same time. The scissors cut the defective DNA in the sperm. Normally cells will repair a CRISPR-induced cut in DNA by essentially gluing the ends back together. Or scientists can try delivering the missing DNA in a repair package, like a computer\u2019s cut-and-paste program. Instead, the newly forming embryos made their own perfect fix without that outside help, reported Oregon Health & Science University senior researcher Shoukhrat Mitalipov. We all inherit two copies of each gene, one from dad and one from mom \u2014 and those embryos just copied the healthy one from the donated egg. \u201cThe embryos are really looking for the blueprint,\u201d Mitalipov, who directs OHSU\u2019s Center for Embryonic Cell and Gene Therapy, said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re finding embryos will repair themselves if you have another healthy copy.\u201d It worked 72 percent of the time, in 42 out of 58 embryos. Normally a sick parent has a 50-50 chance of passing on the mutation. Previous embryo-editing attempts in China found not every cell was repaired, a safety concern called mosaicism. Beginning the process before fertilization avoided that problem: Until now, \u201ceverybody was injecting too late,\u201d Mitalipov said. Nor did intense testing uncover any \u201coff-target\u201d errors, cuts to DNA in the wrong places, reported the team, which also included researchers from the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in California and South Korea\u2019s Institute for Basic Science. The embryos weren\u2019t allowed to develop beyond eight cells, a standard for laboratory research. The experiments were privately funded; U.S. tax dollars aren\u2019t allowed for embryo research. Genetics and ethics experts not involved in the work say it\u2019s a critical first step \u2014 but just one step \u2014 toward eventually testing the process in pregnancy, something currently prohibited by U.S. policy. \u201cThis is very elegant lab work,\u201d but it\u2019s moving so fast that society needs to catch up and debate how far it should go, said Johns Hopkins University bioethicist Jeffrey Kahn. And lots more research is needed to tell if it\u2019s really safe, added Britain\u2019s Lovell-Badge. He and Kahn were part of a National Academy of Sciences report earlier this year that said if germline editing ever were allowed, it should be only for serious diseases with no good alternatives and done with strict oversight. \u201cWhat we do not want is for rogue clinicians to start offering treatments\u201d that are unproven, as has happened with some other experimental technologies, he stressed. Among key questions: Would the technique work if mom, not dad, harbored the mutation? Is repair even possible if both parents pass on a bad gene? Mitalipov is \u201cpushing a frontier,\u201d but it\u2019s responsible basic research that\u2019s critical for understanding embryos and disease inheritance, noted University of Pittsburgh professor Kyle Orwig. In fact, Mitalipov said the research should offer critics some reassurance: If embryos prefer self-repair, it would be extremely hard to add traits for \u201cdesigner babies\u201d rather than just eliminate disease. \u201cAll we did is un-modify the already mutated gene.\u201d ___ This Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

That definitely was not in the script. Downes had asked a cameraman to document his unusual plan to find a soulmate. Instead, it was his mania that was caught on film, giving a rare insight into bipolar disorder. \u201cI wanted to find a bride but when I go manic, I become Ya, the creator of Allah and the creator of God and I start thinking of an awful lot of things other than beautiful ladies that are there,\u201d Downes told Reuters in London after the screening of the documentary created out of his 2009 trip to Jamaica. \u201cTrue Stories: Bipolar Expedition,\u201d by film maker Mark James, aired on British television this week and will become available internationally. \u201cWhen I went to Jamaica, Paul was in the grip of a developing mania which I obviously hadn\u2019t witnessed before and had no idea what that was, so I filmed all the events as you see in the film,\u201d James told Reuters. \u201cHe just got more interested in me and the camera and making speeches which went on every day.\u201d   MODERN-DAY DISEASE   Before being diagnosed with bipolar at the age of 44, Downes was living a high-powered life of luxury, making business deals, playing golf and gambling. But one day, while holidaying in Jamaica, he began acting strangely. He started smoking pot, stopped sleeping, asked a stranger to marry him and eventually jumped off a cliff into the sea without knowing how to swim. \u201cI don\u2019t know what triggered that because if anybody had said that I could possibly have a mental illness in the first 44 years of my life, I\u2019d have said you were the crazy person,\u201d Downes said. Known as the \u201cdisease of the 21st century,\u201d bipolar disorder has made headlines with celebrities such as Stephen Fry, Richard Dreyfuss and Sinead O\u2019Connor openly discussing their struggles. It causes mood swings from severe depression to dramatic highs, which can range from a couple times a year, to a couple times a day, depending on the severity of the disorder in the individual, and is often followed by suicidal feelings. \u201cIn my last manic episode, I had seven chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royces with a private detective visit Prince Charles, Stephen Hawkins and Simon Cowell with DVDs of taped speeches and certain gifts,\u201d Downes said. In the documentary, James suggests that Downes\u2019 first ever manic episode in 2004 was triggered by a business deal gone wrong. Downes strongly denies this, saying he has no idea what sparked it off. There is a lot that is not understood about the condition and the biggest problem medical experts face is actually diagnosing it. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to unravel the origins of the universe,\u201d said James. \u201cWe\u2019ve only just really started to scratch the surface of what the whole universe is about and I think it\u2019s the same with the human mind.\u201d   Many studies have shown there is a definite link between bipolar disorder and creative genius.

Andrew Cuomo and state Attorney General Letitia James, both Democrats, promptly announced they intend to sue the EPA over its decision. They claim levels of the contaminating polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, remain unacceptably high in the river sediment and in fish. Scenic Hudson and Riverkeeper, two environmental groups lobbying for additional dredging, said they would support litigation. \u201cSince the EPA has failed to hold GE accountable for fulfilling its obligation to restore the river, New York state will take any action necessary to protect our waterways and that includes suing the EPA to demand a full and complete remediation,\u2019\u201d Cuomo said in a written news release. \u201cAnything less is unacceptable.\u201d Cuomo accused the Republican Trump Administration of putting corporations\u2019 interests ahead of public health and the environment. EPA officials said their decision was guided by Superfund law and science. The EPA said in a \u201cfive-year review\u201d of the river released Friday that there is not enough testing data on fish, water and sediment yet to determine if the cleanup will succeed in its goal of protecting human health and the environment. Lopez said that will take more time and monitoring before a conclusion could be reached. The review found some signs of progress in removing highly contaminated sediment, though it found three spots in the upper river with slightly elevated levels of PCBs. Until the mid-1970s, GE factories discharged more than 1 million pounds (450,000 kilograms) of PCBs into the river. The probable carcinogen, used as coolants and lubricants in electrical equipment, was banned in 1977. GE said the EPA\u2019s decision confirms the success of the project. \u201cGE will continue to collect environmental data to assess ongoing improvements in river conditions and to work closely with EPA, New York State, and local communities on other Hudson environmental projects,\u201d the company said in a written statement.", "output": "EPA won\u2019t make GE restart Hudson dredging for now.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "Depression is one of the most common forms of mental illness, affecting more than 350 million people worldwide. It is ranked by the World Health Organization as the leading cause of disability globally. Treatment usually involves either medication, some form of  psychotherapy or a combination of both. Yet many patients fail to get better and suffer recurring bouts of illness. MBCT was developed to help such people by teaching them skills to recognize and respond constructively to thoughts and feelings associated with relapse, aiming to prevent a downward spiral into depression. In the first large study to compare MBCT and anti-depressants, researchers found little difference in outcomes. In terms of cost, mindfulness training \u2014 often viewed as more costly because it requires more time with a trained therapist \u2014 was not significantly more pricey, particularly when given in group sessions, the study found. Richard Byng, a professor at Britain\u2019s Plymouth University Peninsula Schools of Medicine and Dentistry, said that, while current standard treatment for chronic depression is to keep taking anti-depressants, many people don\u2019t want to take them for long periods and others want to avoid side-effects. In this study, 424 adults with recurrent major depression who were on maintenance anti-depressant drugs were randomly assigned either to come off their anti-depressants slowly and receive MBCT or to stay on their medication. While 212 patients continued taking their anti-depressants, the other 212 attended eight group mindfulness therapy sessions and were given daily home practice as well as an option to have four follow-up sessions over a 12-month period. Study results published in The Lancet medical journal showed that after two years, relapse rates were similar in both groups \u2014 at 44 percent in the therapy group versus 47 percent in the anti-depressant drug group. \u201cWhilst this study doesn\u2019t show that mindfulness-based cognitive therapy works any better than maintenance anti-depressant medication in reducing the rate of relapse ... these results suggest a new choice for the millions of people with recurrent depression on repeat prescriptions,\u201d said Willem Kuyken of Oxford University, who worked with Byng on the research.", "output": "Mindfulness therapy as good as medication for chronic depression - study.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "The Kearney Hub reports that Mayor Stan Clouse made the request at Tuesday\u2019s City Council meeting.

The researchers also noted increases in depression, alcohol-related disorders and suicides in Spain since the financial crisis hit and unemployment increased. \u201cIf no corrective measures are implemented, this could worsen with the risk of increases in HIV and tuberculosis \u2014 as we have seen in Greece where healthcare services have had severe cuts \u2014 as well as the risk of a rise in drug resistance and spread of disease,\u201d said Helena Legido-Quigley, a lecturer in Global Health at LSHTM who worked with McKee. The findings in Spain chime with other studies in Europe and North America which found budget cuts had a devastating effect on health, driving up suicides, depression and infectious diseases and reducing access to medicines and care. In a book published in April, researchers said around 10,000 suicides and a million cases of depression had been diagnosed during what they called the \u201cGreat Recession\u201d and the austerity measures that have come with it across Europe and North America. The BMJ study noted that Spain already had one of the lowest public expenditures on healthcare relative to GDP in the European Union. It said planned further cuts to a dependency fund for the elderly and disabled this year would put these vulnerable people even more at risk. Other changes in health provision include excluding unofficial immigrants from accessing free health services and increasing payments by patients for extra treatments such as drugs, prosthetics and some ambulance trips.

We were a little concerned about some of the phrasing in the story. It says, \u201cBut some, including the manufacturer of the Lap-Band \u2014 used in a technique called laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding \u2014 take exception to the study, criticizing the small sample size and the number of patients lost to follow-up.The critics also point out that both the device itself and the expertise of surgeons placing it have improved greatly since the patients in the study had their bands placed, in the years 1994 through 1997.\u201d This leads readers to believe that there are mulitple critics out there pointing out flaws in the study. The story itself, though, only quotes one actual critic: the company spokewoman. The criticisms may be valid, but readers deserved a strong independent analysis of the study\u2019s limitations. While the story did mention at the very end how the pace of weight loss with the product reported on compared with weight loss following gastric bypass surgery, the story ought to have provided better insight about the long-term outcomes in those who have gastric bypass and those who chose not to have surgery to help manage their excess weight.

More research labs are retiring primates to sanctuaries like Primates Inc., a 17-acre (7-hectare) rural compound in central Wisconsin, where they can live their remaining years, according to the sanctuaries and researchers. For some monkeys, it\u2019s their first time hanging out in the fresh air. \u201cJust to see them look around in amazement. You know it was all very calm and peaceful,\u201d said Amy Kerwin, who worked for 15 years to get the Westfield, Wisconsin, sanctuary off the ground after being employed in a University of Wisconsin research lab. There were approximately 110,000 primates in research facilities in 2017, according to the most recent data available from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. While most research facilities need primates to be euthanized to examine their tissues, technological advances, such as brain scans, mean fewer monkeys need to be put down. Plus, researchers who become close with the animals are making more efforts to give the ones who can survive a retirement, rather than euthanization. In 2015, a group of researchers, graduate students and an ethicist created the Research Animal Retirement Foundation. It raises funds for labs to pay the sanctuaries to retire them. So far they have given $33,000 in funding for three monkeys who went to the Wisconsin sanctuary. A visit to the Peaceable Primate Sanctuary in Indiana helped convince Rep. Jackie Walorski, R-Ind., to author a bill introduced last month, along with Rep. Brendan Boyle, D-Penn., that requires federal agencies to develop a policy allowing animals no longer needed for research to be adopted out or put in sanctuaries. Currently, no federal regulations dictate what happens to them. Some are sold to other studies when one study is done. The bill doesn\u2019t address funding, one of the main hurdles to get primates into retirement sanctuaries. Currently, grants through the National Institutes of Health, which is the largest public funder of biomedical research in the world, don\u2019t include money for retirement. That leaves the labs and sanctuaries to find the tens of thousands of dollars per monkey, per year needed to care for them. Monkeys are finished with studies at different ages and some can live for decades. Some can also leave with lingering issues, like compulsive behaviors caused by boredom. That\u2019s why many sanctuaries require the labs to send some funding, often between $10,000 and $20,000, to help care and create space for monkeys. Since many of the primates have only lived in labs, they don\u2019t have the skills needed to live in the wild. Most primates in accredited sanctuaries are chimpanzees, capuchins, and squirrel monkeys, according to Erika Fleury, program director for the North American Primate Sanctuary Alliance, or NAPSA, an advocacy group for captive primates. They come from research, the entertainment industry or private homes. Chimpanzees are no longer used in most research. The NIH announced in 2013 it would stop supporting them in research and that they should be moved to sanctuaries, with funding. It pointed to a report from the Institute of Medicine in 2011 that concluded the use of chimpanzees in biomedical research was unnecessary. Cindy Buckmaster, chair of the Americans for Medical Progress, which represents research universities and medical research companies, said that besides funding, researchers are concerned about sanctuaries standards, their financial viability and whether some sanctuaries\u2019 ties to animal rights groups will cause them to badmouth the institution. \u201cWe really feel very grateful to them and we want them to have wonderful lives after,\u201d Buckmaster said. \u201cThey certainly deserve it. But it has to be done well and it has to be done properly because we\u2019re not going to put our animals in harm\u2019s way.\u201d Some animal rights groups, including People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, don\u2019t support research but do agree with retiring monkeys to sanctuaries rather than having them euthanized. Sanctuaries have been around for decades but, in 2010, more than a half-dozen came together to create NAPSA. Currently, there are eight member sanctuaries, with about 775 primates. Membership requires the sanctuaries be USDA licensed, accredited by the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries or certified by the Association of Zoos & Aquariums, among many guidelines. There are 31 other, nonmember sanctuaries in the U.S. and Canada that have primates but have a variety of standards, according to NAPSA. Besides requiring high standards for sanctuaries, NAPSA is also upping efforts with researchers to encourage them to ask for retirement funding upfront. An NIH spokeswoman wouldn\u2019t respond to whether the agency would consider adding money to grants for monkey retirement care, only saying in a statement that the animals\u2019 owners are responsible for ongoing care. Kerwin, who started the Wisconsin sanctuary, said she\u2019s seen monkeys become calmer in retirement. Her goal is to have 100 monkeys over the next 20 years. \u201cJust knowing that these little individual personalities are in the thousands and largely no one knows about them and even the need to help them.

For months now, Republican Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam has highlighted a surprising factoid about Florida\u2019s nursing workforce, often while emphasizing the importance of trade education and career training outside of a four-year bachelor\u2019s degree. \"\"The No. 1 job vacancy in Florida every month for seven years has been nursing,\"\" Putnam said Oct. 31 during a campaign stop at Whitey's Fish Camp in Fleming Island. Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum (and Putnam\u2019s possible opponent) has also mentioned a nursing shortage in the state, so we wanted to take a look at it. We found that Putnam\u2019s claim is backed up by state data, and experts in Florida agreed that the shortage of nurses has been a problem since the 1990s. Data from the Department of Economic Opportunity shows that registered nurses have consistently topped the lists of monthly online job advertisements and annual job openings. Department\u00a0spokeswoman Karen Smith told PolitiFact Florida the top online job advertisement in Florida has been registered nurses every month for the past seven years. We asked for a sample of that data and got a year\u2019s worth of monthly reports for Help Wanted OnLine, a tool used by the Department to measure real-time labor demand. These reports are posted on the DEO\u2019s site and updated monthly. The most recent month of data (October 2017) shows there were 13,619 online ads placed for registered nurses. The second-most popular ads sought retail salespersons at 7,207 postings, followed by \"\"first-line supervisors\"\" for retail sales workers with 6,467 ads. Putnam has also talked about the need for truck drivers, which place fourth for online job ads. In addition, Florida's Statewide Demand Occupations List shows that registered nurses have consistently ranked as the most in-demand occupation since at least 2011. Mary Lou Brunell is the executive director of the Florida Center for Nursing, which was set up in 2001 by the Florida Legislature to address the nursing shortages in the state. In recent years, she said the problem has been exacerbated by a lack of students studying to become nurses, a shortage of faculty teaching future students, and an aging workforce and state population. \"\"You put all those pieces together, and it\u2019s just not getting better,\"\" said Dianne Morrison-Beedy, the former\u00a0dean at the University of South Florida College of Nursing. The nursing workforce is also aging. According to a 2017 report from the Florida Center for Nursing, 44 percent of registered nurses are over the age of 50 and expected to retire in the next 5 to 10 years. The economic turnaround in the late 2000s also decreased the number of nurses in the workforce. When the economy plummeted in 2008, many people trained in nursing but not working returned to their job or delayed retirement. As the economy improved, there were once again more vacancies because those nurses returned home or retired. Brunell also said she\u2019s also concerned about the need for licensed practical nurses, which work under the guidance of registered nurses or physicians. She said there\u2019s been an increase in home care facilities, which is why she predicts more licensed practical nurses (LPNs)\u00a0will be needed in the future. Morrison-Beedy said that in order to fix the problem, the focus has to be on the how to develop faculty and support for people who want to become nurses. In Florida, becoming a registered nurse requires either a two-year associate degree or a bachelor\u2019s of science degree in nursing. \"\"We need more students in the baccalaureate program, we need to provide financial support for students to go to school, and in order to do that we have to have enough faculty to teach those students,\"\" she said. \"\"We want the best educated and the best kind of nurses because that\u2019s where we\u2019ll see better outcomes.\"\" Putnam said the No. 1 job vacancy in Florida every month for seven years has been nursing. He\u2019s right. The top online job advertisement in Florida has been registered nurses every month for the past seven years.

Cunnington said a theory has developed that this may be because the bacteria the baby is exposed to in the birth canal during a vaginal birth colonise the baby\u2019s gut, so exposing those who miss out on it might help protect them. \u201cPeople have made a leap of logic that gut bacteria must be the link between caesarean section and risk of these diseases,\u201d Cunningham said. \u201cBut we just don\u2019t know this for sure - or whether we can even influence this by transferring bacteria on a swab from mum to baby.\u201d  He added that while there is no evidence of benefits from \u201cvaginal seeding\u201d, the practice has potential risks such as transferring harmful bacteria to the baby. \u201cDoctors, nurses, midwives and parents need to be aware they are doing something with a potential risk that currently doesn\u2019t have any evidence of benefit,\u201d Cunnington said. He added that evidence-based interventions, such as encouraging breast feeding and avoiding unnecessary antibiotics, could be \u201cmore important to a baby\u2019s gut bacteria than worrying about transferring vaginal fluid on a swab\u201d.", "output": "Doctors warn of demand for 'vaginal seeding' despite thin evidence.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "Not applicable. The story presented the outcome of 472 obese individuals and examined in more detail those who were able, on average, to loss 14 pounds over a period of 26 weeks. The story did not provide any insight as to whether this amount of weight loss resulted in any health improvement in the obese individuals who were studied. So the true benefit \u2013 the true significance of the potential benefit \u2013 was not explained. Further \u2013 while the study found that those who got an adequate amount of sleep were among the cohort of individuals who were found to lose the most weight, the story did not explicitly point out that the study does not inform us about whether enforced hours of sleep would impact weight loss and weight loss management. So, again, the headline, the story\u2019s first sentence, and the call to action by the researcher were not balanced. The story was reporting on the impact of getting adequate amounts of sleep on weight loss. While there was no overt discussion of the harm of obtaining adequate amounts of sleep, there doesn\u2019t appear to be any harm involved in adequate sleep. Similar to the LA Times story we reviewed on the same study, this story did not challenge researchers\u2019 comments that went too far in promoting a call to action based on one observational study \u2013 a study that can\u2019t prove cause and effect. Its opening sentence is an example of that flaw:\u00a0 \u201cIf you\u2019re looking to lose those extra pounds, you should probably add reducing stress and getting the right amount of sleep to the list\u2026\u201d Later, it didn\u2019t challenge a researcher when he said, \u201cIf you want to lose weight, things that will help you include reducing stress and getting the right amount of sleep.\u201d\u00a0 That\u2019s pushing the limits of what one can conclude based on one observational study and the story should have explained that limitation. Toward the end, in describing another study, it started in a good direction by explaining that conclusions \u201cshould be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\u201d\u00a0 Actually, they should be considered preliminary because they were based on analysis of just 26 people. They should be considered to have evaded full scrutiny by expert colleagues until published in a peer-reviewed journal. Just because work has not been peer-reviewed does not make it preliminary. The intent, we think, was correct. But the explanation \u2013 the limitation \u2013 was not defined appropriately. The story did not engage in overt disease mongering. This story included expert quotes and also some insight from the results of a recently presented study. One of the strengths of this story in comparison with its shorter LA Times competition is the context it provided, much of it from an independent expert who said: \u201cPeople who are healthy and vital tend to be healthy and vital not because of any one factor, but because of many. And the factors that promote health \u2014 eating well, being active, not smoking, sleeping enough, controlling stress, to name a few \u2013promote all aspects of health. \u2026The important message is that weight loss should not be looked at with tunnel vision. \u2026 This study encourages weight loss in a more holistic context.\u201d Not applicable. The story was framed as taking a broader perspective when contemplating weight loss and including other lifestyle factors which can affect food intake and exercise. Better than its LA Times competition, at least this story nodded in the direction of one other recent study on sleep and weight, thereby conveying that the newer study is not the only research on this topic.

Dowell, a retired labor union worker, has rheumatoid arthritis and a compromised immune system. Her husband Donald, 74, suffers from emphysema. Her mother, Margaret Hildebrandt, 93, also has a lung disease and needs oxygen. Dowell took over her mother\u2019s care from a visiting nurse because she worried an outsider could contaminate the home. \u201cIf my mom gets this, she\u2019d be gone in a day,\u201d said Dowell, who wears a baby-monitor and answers her mother\u2019s calls for help through the night. \u201cMy mom beat cancer nine times. I don\u2019t want her to die from this.\u201d  The elderly are especially vulnerable in the global pandemic and health officials and governments are increasingly calling for extreme measures to safeguard them. Across the globe, many cities have all but shut down as officials issue dire warnings for younger people - who can carry the virus without knowing it - to avoid their parents and grandparents. But this growing isolation of the elderly has spawned its own crisis, as families try to balance the need to care for loved ones with directives to stay away, shifting the burden to overstretched governments and medical facilities. Studies suggest the severity of coronavirus rises with age. In Italy, which now has the world\u2019s highest death count, the average age of those dying is 80, according to a study by the Italian national institute of health. In China, where the pandemic started, people 70 and older accounted for just 12 percent of all infections but more than half of all deaths, according to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. In the United States, people 65 and older  have thus far accounted for 31 percent of cases, 53 percent of intensive care hospitalizations and 80 percent of deaths, according to U.S. government data. Beyond the grim statistics, the pandemic has spawned countless small dramas of isolation and anxiety across the globe. In a village in Lebanon, a grandmother walled herself off in her home, unable to properly grieve her dead husband. In Spain, nursery home workers produced a Facebook video so residents could reassure their loved ones. And in Colombia - where the government on Tuesday ordered citizens 70 and over to stay inside until May 31 - seniors stocked up on supplies for two months of isolation. \u201cThey need to take these measures because many people are taking the situation lightly,\u201d said shopper Carlos Manrique, 74, as he loaded up on potatoes, eggs and rice at a supermarket in Bogota. \u201cI\u2019m taking care of myself, as God orders.\u201d  Just as often, older people greeted the epidemic with defiance. \u201cI am not worried about the coronavirus at all,\u201d said Yutaka Kobayashi, 85, who refuses to wear a mask while working in his Tokyo shoe store. \u201cPeople of my generation were made to wash their hands by their mothers and grandmothers.\u201d  In Italy, where more than 3,400 people have died since the outbreak came to light on Feb. 21, local officials fret about the psychological state of elderly people confined to their homes for weeks in a government lockdown. The town of San Casciano in Val di Pesa launched an initiative called \u201cCiao Nonna, come stai?\u201d or \u201cHello Gran, how are you?\u201d urging all young people to call elderly relatives \u2013 or even older people they don\u2019t know. One nursing home, Nuestra Casa La Grande in Navares de Enmedio, Spain, recorded a video of 24 elderly residents and posted it on Facebook, encouraging each other to blow kisses to the camera for their loved ones. Jonathan Barrios, a 24-year-old student living with his parents in La Parla, Madrid, said he doesn\u2019t dare see his grandparents, who live on the same street. His 80-year-old grandfather has lung cancer. His grandmother, 70, has symptoms of the virus - a fever, cough and difficulty breathing - but can\u2019t get tested because of a shortage of kits. \u201cI feel strange and frustrated,\u201d Barrios said. \u201cAll I can do for my grandparents is to call them.\u201d  The forced isolation perhaps cuts deepest for those in mourning. Joey Ayoub, a Lebanese researcher, said his grandfather died this week of problems unrelated to the coronavirus. He worries for his grandmother, who suddenly lives alone. Only six or seven people attended her husband\u2019s funeral, which Ayoub said would otherwise have attracted \u201cdozens and dozens.\u201d They all sat at a distance from one another during a rushed service. \u201cShe can\u2019t mourn properly,\u201d he said. \u201cShe cannot do it with friends.\u201d  Some families have been hit hard when senior care centers closed, forcing them to take off work to watch over relatives. In the central Japan city of Nagoya, the mayor asked 126 such facilities to shut down for two weeks after a cluster of coronavirus cases was found at one of them. Japan has already weathered serious outbreaks of the virus and has huge numbers of people at risk - more than 28 percent of the nation\u2019s population is 65 or over. But now, some people are venturing out again. \u201cIf I get it, I get it,\u201d said Kazuko Mori, 74, a part-time cleaner in suburban Ichikawa, which had clusters of cases originating at a sports gym and an elderly daycare service. \u201cIf you get too nervous about it all, that isn\u2019t good, either.\u201d  Many elderly people said they can\u2019t follow government directives to stay home. In Kibera, a settlement of densely packed neighborhoods where few homes have running water in Kenya\u2019s capital Nairobi, volunteers knocked on doors to tell people \u2013 especially the elderly \u2013 about the coronavirus. In one courtyard filled with children, Fatima Juma listened intently as Zulela Abdul explained the risks to her and handed over a small bottle of hand sanitizer. Juma, who says she\u2019s about 82, had heard of the disease on television but didn\u2019t know its symptoms. She was fine with washing her hands but rejected the idea of social distancing. She takes care of her grandchildren, the youngest one two years old, while their parents worked. She also needed to see her friends, she said. \u201cThis government directive is not good for me. I need to go to the market,\u201d she said firmly, bangles flashing in the sunlight. \u201cIf there is a death outside, I need to go and console that person.\u201d  In Communist-run Cuba, which has Latin America\u2019s oldest population, many people are forced to work long after retirement age to supplement meager pensions. Even in normal times, they endure long lines at stores and pharmacies. \u201cI am very worried because I have asthma, and if I get it, I will die,\u201d said Maria Torres Hernandez, 75, waiting alongside dozens of others outside a pharmacy in central Havana that had just received its ration of supplies. \u201cI have to look after myself.\u201d  Angel Pupo Osorio, 80, works as a parking attendant in Havana to supplement his $12-a-month pension, and can\u2019t afford to quit. So far, the disease hasn\u2019t hit his neighborhood. \u201cI\u2019m going to continue working as long as I can, out of necessity,\u201d said Pupo, wearing his uniform, a scarlet jacket and cap. Lucy Mayimela, a 68-year-old grandmother, first heard about the coronavirus on Monday when she made a trip to buy spinach for her fruit and vegetable stand in Kliptown, on the outskirts of Johannesburg. The farmer selling it to her wore a mask and insisted everyone repeatedly wash their hands before touching anything. Mayimela laughed bitterly at a suggestion she heard on the radio that she should isolate herself at home. \u201cIsolate myself how?\u201d she scoffed. She lives in a small shack with six relatives, in a community with a single wash basin and toilet for dozens of people. The produce stand she has run for 36 years provides her family\u2019s only income. \u201cI\u2019ll end up dying of hunger\u201d if people stay indoors, she said. \u201cIf God wants me to die, then it\u2019s my time.\u201d", "output": "Coronavirus spreads fear, isolation, death to elderly worldwide.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "\"TXA costs $10 per treatment, according to the story.

In an ominous sign he and other governors are preparing for the worst, the states of New York, North Carolina and Hawaii requested the Federal Emergency Management Agency send special mortuary teams that can be deployed for mass casualties, FEMA said on Wednesday. New Orleans, where large crowds celebrated Mardi Gras a month ago, was on track to become the next U.S. epicenter, as Louisiana\u2019s Gulf Coast metropolis recorded the world\u2019s highest growth rate in coronavirus cases. Cuomo announced new steps aimed at containing the virus. New York City - home to over 8 million people - closed some of its largely empty streets to vehicle traffic to allow more room for pedestrians to walk with greater \u201csocial distancing.\u201d    At a news conference, Cuomo said the city also would ban basketball and other contact sports in public parks, while lamenting the challenges posed by dense populations. \u201cOur closeness makes us vulnerable,\u201d he said. Nationwide, nearly 68,000 people have been diagnosed with COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the highly contagious virus, as the U.S. death toll approached 1,000. Only two other nations - China and Italy - have more cases of the virus, which is particularly perilous to elderly people and those with underlying chronic health conditions. At least 30,800 people have tested positive for the virus in New York state and more than 17,800 in New York City alone. By Wednesday night, the number of coronavirus fatalities had climbed to 280, up 81 from the number reported hours earlier when the statewide death toll stood at 285. An updated toll for the state was not immediately available. New York state as a whole, accounting for roughly half the country\u2019s known infections, followed California last week in ordering non-essential businesses to close and to direct residents to stay home as much as possible. As of Wednesday, the governors of at least 21 states, representing more than half the U.S. population of 330 million, have imposed such restrictions, designed to curb transmission of the virus by limiting congregations of people. Even before states began adopting those measures last week, the pandemic paralyzed parts of the U.S. economy and upended daily life as schools and colleges closed and workplaces shuttered voluntarily or under local government orders. The crisis, sparking projections of a global recession amid tumbling stock prices, has put public health authorities at odds with President Donald Trump, who had pointed to a robust economy and stock market in making his case for reelection in November. Trump this week has pushed to reopen commerce by April 12, Easter Sunday, and on Wednesday blamed news outlets for exerting pressure to keep restrictions in place. \u201cThe LameStream Media is the dominant force in trying to get me to keep our Country closed as long as possible in the hope that it will be detrimental to my election success,\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet. \u201cThe real people want to get back to work ASAP.\u201d   Health experts insist reopening businesses and schools too soon would only risk fueling transmission of the virus, overwhelming a hospital system already facing equipment and personnel shortages, and ultimately worsen the economic fallout. Cuomo cited recent coronavirus hospitalization figures in his state as evidence that social distancing was starting to work. While hospitalizations had been doubling every two days as of Sunday, those numbers were doubling every 3.4 days by Monday, and by Tuesday the rate was every 4.7 days, Cuomo said. \u201cThis is a very good sign and a positive sign, again not 100% sure it holds ... but the arrows are headed in the right direction,\u201d Cuomo said. Diagnostic testing remained a challenge in New York and around the country. At Elmhurst Hospital Center in New York\u2019s Queens borough, scores of people, most wearing surgical masks, lined up on Wednesday to be tested at a tent outside. Dr. Ashley Bray, 27, a general medicine resident interviewed by the New York Times, described the situation inside the 545-bed hospital as \u201capocalyptic,\u201d recounting how she performed chest compressions on at least three coronavirus patients, one after the other, all of whom eventually died. The deteriorating situation in New Orleans dashed hopes that less densely populated cities and those in warmer climates might escape the worst of the pandemic. Local authorities have warned that hospitals in the Mississippi River port city could reach the point of collapse by April 4. Trump issued federal disaster declarations for Louisiana and Iowa late on Tuesday and for Texas and Florida on Wednesday, freeing up federal funds to help states cope. The three states hardest hit so far - New York, California and Washington - were given such status previously. Dr. Rebekah Gee, head of Louisiana State University\u2019s healthcare services division, said that Mardi Gras, when 1.4 million tourists descended on New Orleans for celebrations that included tightly packed street parades, fed the city\u2019s outbreak. New Orleans restaurant owner Ronnie Evans said everyone in New Orleans was \u201cfreaking out.\u201d  \u201cPeople don\u2019t know what to expect or how long this will last.

Despite the strong uptake in coronavirus testing, the cancellation of non-essential surgeries and restrictions on people\u2019s movement are expected to severely crimp sales of its medical devices and other lab tests, which contribute to more than half of total quarterly revenue. \u201c(The second quarter) will likely be our toughest quarter in the year, especially for our core lab business, our cardio and neuro businesses,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Robert Ford said on a post-earnings call.

The rate of those injuries almost doubled during the study period, from about four children for every 100,000, to between seven and eight per 100,000. That\u2019s probably due to more and more household electronics, hearing aids and toys using button batteries, rather than the previous cylindrical batteries, with more than 80 percent of all emergency room visits involving button batteries. \u201cThey\u2019re shiny, they\u2019re small and children explore things developmentally with their mouth - if they don\u2019t know what something is, they put it in their mouth,\u201d said Nicholas Slamon, a pediatrician who has treated battery-related injuries at Nemours/Alfred I. DuPont Hospital for Children in Wilmington. There are a few ways button batteries can cause injury, he added. They can lodge or wedge in the esophagus and push on its walls, or they can leak acid if the casing around the battery is eroded. But the most common fear is that they can create an electrical current flowing through tissue, even if they don\u2019t have enough juice to power a remote control anymore. Slamon and colleagues see several children a year who need emergency surgery to retrieve a battery from the throat, nose or ear. But only a small number of visits, about eight percent, require such serious intervention. Experts agreed that parents should make sure all compartments on battery cases are screwed in or taped shut and dead batteries should be thrown into the bottom of the trash where children are unlikely to find them, Slamon added. \u201cThe real way to prevent these (emergencies) is to prevent the event from happening in the first place,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIf (parents) suspect something, they need to get to the hospital and get an X-ray done immediately.\u201d   SOURCE: bit.ly/jsoh2P", "output": "\"Children at risk as \"\"button\"\" battery use grows: study.\"", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "Deals being negotiated between drugmakers and the insurers who buy medicines now sometimes include extra rebates \u2014 or even full refunds \u2014 if drugs don\u2019t help patients as expected. It\u2019s part of an effort driven by insurers and government health programs to align the cost of care with the quality of care, and slow the relentless growth of prescription drug costs. \u201cWe\u2019re spending less money on drugs that are less effective,\u201d said Dr. Michael Sherman, chief medical officer for the not-for-profit insurer Harvard Pilgrim, which has several of these deals and is negotiating more. Sherman says one-fourth of every dollar it spends on patient care goes to prescription drugs. For the patient, it doesn\u2019t mean a check in the mail if cancer comes back after a round of treatment. But it does mean patients could get a drug that an insurer might otherwise be unwilling to pay for and that might help them. And insurers, who now can track how patients fare through electronic medical records, will be reducing wasteful spending and making at least a dent in overall health care costs. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be part of the solution\u201d to soaring drug prices, predicts Roger Longman, CEO of Real Endpoints, an analytics company that assesses the value of medicines for drugmakers, insurers and other clients. Many new drugs now top $100,000 per year or course of treatment, even though their benefits are unclear or only marginally better than cheaper, older drugs. Buyers of those new drugs, usually insurance companies, are hesitant to pay without assurance the drugs will help patients. Not only is that bad for patients, it makes insurers spend even more on complications and hospital stays if the drugs don\u2019t work. As a result, insurers often restrict access to expensive new drugs. Sometimes that\u2019s achieved by making patients pay more out of their own pockets, or making doctors wade through red tape to get authorization for a patient\u2019s medicine. Sometimes patients have to try cheaper drugs first, and only when they fail \u2014 and the patients\u2019 health has deteriorated \u2014 are they allowed to get the pricey new drug. Pharmaceutical companies have an incentive here, too: These deals may help them sell more of the new drug they\u2019ve spent hundreds of millions of dollars or more developing. For example, a new generation of injected cholesterol drugs does an impressive job of reducing so-called bad cholesterol. But the drugs, Amgen\u2019s Repatha and Sanofi\u2019s Praluent, cost $14,000 a year, while cheap generic pills do a good job of lowering cholesterol for most people for $300 a year or less. Predictably, insurers often reject prescriptions for these drugs. So Amgen, trying to boost disappointing sales for a drug expected to be a huge seller, is offering full refunds to insurers if patients have a heart attack or stroke while taking its drug. On Tuesday, Amgen announced its first deal to do so, with Harvard Pilgrim. Sanofi has a contract with insurer Cigna to pay extra rebates if patient cholesterol doesn\u2019t fall as much as expected. \u201cIt demonstrates the fact that we are standing behind the value the product has, and we\u2019re willing to put some money behind it,\u201d said James Borneman, Sanofi\u2019s head of strategic pricing. Some insurers are now demanding these deals, which are expected to become standard for some drugs: super-expensive medicines for cancer and rare diseases, and others that are used widely enough to cost insurers millions. In addition, the drugs must have a benefit that\u2019s easy to measure, such as keeping kids with asthma out of the emergency room or preventing growth of cancerous tumors for a certain period. Cigna has been pursuing more of these types of deals after finding that some of its earlier efforts \u201cmet or exceeded expectations in terms of benefit to our customers, patients,\u201d said Chris Bradbury, who heads Cigna\u2019s prescription benefit program. One of its early deals, with drugmaker Merck for its diabetes pills Januvia and Janumet, dates to 2009, with rebates pegged to how much patients lower blood sugar. \u201cWe keep re-signing that agreement, so I think they\u2019re pretty satisfied,\u201d said Bob McMahon, head of U.S. marketing at Merck, which also has such contracts with insurers and hospital systems covering an asthma medicine and is negotiating contracts for an infection drug. Other companies with such deals for one or more medicines include drugmakers Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, Novartis, Novo Nordisk and Roche\u2019s Genentech unit; insurers Aetna and Priority Health, and prescription benefit manager Express Scripts. On their own, these deals are unlikely to reverse the persistent rise in medical spending, experts say. But they improve the chance that the money will at least go to treatments that work best \u2014 by making sure insurers and drug companies have something at stake along with the patient. \u201cThere\u2019s a risk on both sides with these contracts,\u201d said Dr. Mark Fendrick, director of the University of Michigan\u2019s Center for Value-Based Insurance Design. \u201cBoth want to make sure they\u2019ll get the outcome they want.\u201d ___ Follow Linda A.

Some districts have opted for completely virtual learning. Others will try a mix of both online and in-person classes, or will send younger children to school while older kids stay home, or will phase students back to the classroom gradually. Others still are calling for schools to reopen completely for those who feel well enough to teach and attend, and who aren\u2019t especially vulnerable to COVID-19. One such voice is U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, who in an Aug. 13, 2020 radio interview with Milwaukee talk show host Steve Scaffidi on WTMJ-AM discussed why he believes students need to return to school in person this fall. For younger people, Johnson asserted, \"\"seasonal flu is actually, in many cases, a deadlier virus if they contract that.\"\" Is Johnson correct that COVID-19 is less deadly for children than the flu? Let\u2019s dig in. COVID was less harsh on kids than the flu, this year\u2019s stats show To back up his claim, Johnson\u2019s office sent statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on flu and COVID-19 deaths among Americans under age 18. During the 2018-19 flu season, the CDC reported approximately 480 flu deaths among children ages 0-17, about 30% of whom had a lab-confirmed case of influenza. Comparably, 90 American youth have died from coronavirus complications from the beginning of the pandemic through mid-August, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. More than 46,000 children were hospitalized for flu in that 2018-19 period. The hospitalization rate among children 5 to 17 was 39.2 children per 100,000 children. For COVID-19, that hospitalization rate is 6 per 100,000 children ages 5 to 17, the CDC says. In a report detailing the differences between COVID-19 and the flu, the CDC states that \"\"the risk of complications for healthy children is higher for flu compared to COVID-19.\"\" And data from Wisconsin echoes that sentiment. Since the pandemic began, no children have died from COVID-19 complications, according to state Department of Health Services death data, and 147 people ages 0-19 have been hospitalized. In contrast, three pediatric flu deaths occurred during this year\u2019s flu season, DHS data show, and 605 kids ages 17 and under have been hospitalized. The data show there have been fewer childhood deaths from COVID-19 so far this year than from the seasonal flu. The hold-up, of course, lies in nuance, said Dr. Jon Temte, associate dean for public health and community engagement within UW-Madison\u2019s School of Medicine and Public Health. \"\"U.S. schools have been out (and) mostly closed since March, thus extremely limiting cases of SARS-CoV-2 in children. Conversely, we rarely close schools for influenza, thus allowing an attack rate of 30-40% in school-aged children,\"\" Temte wrote in an Aug. 27, 2020 email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. That is, the flu has been able to spread through children more commonly than COVID-19, creating more cases, more complications and more deaths. Other experts agree. Dr. Chad Vercio, chair of pediatrics at Riverside University Health System in California, said children\u2019s risk from the coronavirus depends on how widespread the virus is in any given area, and that \"\"it is unknown\"\" if COVID hospitalization rates would rise once schools reopen. And though the early data suggests that COVID-19 is not as bad for children as the flu, it\u2019s just that: Early. Dr. Vidya Mony, an infectious disease expert with Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in San Jose, Calif., said there isn\u2019t enough data yet to say indisputably that COVID risks are lower for kids. Johnson claimed that in many cases, the seasonal flu was a deadlier virus for youth than COVID-19. The numbers show that this year, that was the case. More children died from flu complications than from COVID-19, and were hospitalized at higher rates for the flu. But experts caution that we don\u2019t have enough data to paint the full picture so early in the game, and that schools shutting down in early spring may have driven down coronavirus case rates in children \u2014 meaning we can\u2019t be sure exactly how the virus will move through young people when more of them are potentially getting exposed.

Bill Nelson \u2014 and Rubio went for big ideas. \"\"America is not perfect,\"\" said the freshman Republican, the child of Cuban immigrants. \"\"... But since her earliest days, America has inspired people from all over the world. Inspired them with the hope that one day their own countries would be one like this one. Many others decided they could not wait. And so they came here from everywhere, to pursue their dreams and to work to leave their children better off than themselves. And the result was the American miracle.\"\" As he held the floor for nearly 15 minutes, Rubio highlighted rags-to-riches stories that he said happen \"\"only in America,\"\" describing the founders of Nordstrom, Mattel and eBay. When he finished, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., commended him, saying, \"\"No one expresses American exceptionalism better than Sen. Rubio.\"\" Rubio traced America\u2019s role in the 20th century, from two world wars to the Cold War and the defeat of communism. Then he turned to other contributions:  While our military and foreign policy contributions helped save the world, it was our economic and cultural innovations that helped transform it. The fruits of the American miracle can be found in the daily lives of people everywhere. Anywhere in the world, when someone uses a mobile phone, e-mail, the Internet or GPS, they are enjoying the benefits of the American miracle. Anywhere in the world, when a bone marrow, lung or heart transplant saves a life, they are touched by the value of the American miracle. And on one night in July of 1969, the whole world witnessed the American miracle firsthand. For on that night an American walked on the surface of the moon, and it was clear to the whole world that these Americans\u2026 could do anything. We briefly considered wading into fringe conspiracy theories about whether astronauts actually walked on the moon, but got control of ourselves. We were more curious about his other technology claims. Were Americans truly the ones responsible for innovation of the mobile phone, e-mail, the Internet and the global positioning system? We dropped a line to Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos, who provided us with links about inventors of the mobile phone, e-mail, the Internet and GPS. Indeed, stories from The Telegraph (via Huffington Post), NPR, the Internet Society, PBS and MITnews identify American origins for all four technologies. But these are complex systems that have developed over time. We wondered: Was there more to the story? Mobile phone  A lot fits under the umbrella \"\"mobile phone\"\" -- including, say, early radio technology that led to car phones by the 1940s. But Rubio\u2019s spokesman pointed to the inventor of the first portable cellular phone, which is fine by us. (Did you think of dawn-of-the-1900s ship-to-shore communication when Rubio said \"\"mobile phone\"\"? We didn\u2019t think so.) Martin Cooper worked for Illinois company Motorola as it developed the DynaTAC phone and the cellular network behind it in the early 1970s. The lead engineer for the team that developed the phone, Martin made the first wireless call from Manhattan in 1973. The FCC approved the phone -- the world\u2019s first commercial portable cell phone -- for regular folks in 1983. Now, Japan and some European countries were quicker to deploy cellular networks, in the late \u201870s and very early \u201880s. But Paul Levinson, a Fordham University professor who wrote the 2004 book \"\"Cellphone: The Story of the World's Most Mobile Medium and How It Has Transformed Everything!\"\" says it\u2019s the phone that matters. \"\"That was the breakthrough,\"\" he said \"\"There were several different companies and scientists working on it. \u2026 But no one believed that it could be done. \u2026 So everything that came afterwards was based on that first breakthrough.\"\" An American breakthrough. Score one for Rubio. Internet & E-mail  We read the work from the Internet Society and PBS that Burgos sent our way, then exchanged messages with Stephen Stein, who teaches the history of technology at the University of Memphis. Computer networks that led to the Internet we know today include Arpanet , a 1970s project of the U.S. Department of Defense, and NSFnet, created by the National Science Foundation in the 1980s. These projects, with their indisputably American roots, provided two cornerstones of the modern-day Web: the TCP/IP protocol and a major communications backbone. But Stein pointed out that the way we interact with the Internet owes much to the work of Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist who worked for CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory in Switzerland. It was there -- in the late \u201880s as NSFnet was being developed in the United States -- that Berners-Lee \"\"developed the whole concept of the World Wide Web,\"\" Stein said. (There\u2019s more on this in a PBS article related to the one Burgos sent.) HTTP? HTML? Both Berners-Lee. \"\"So, yes, Americans developed the Internet, but Berners-Lee made it user-friendly,\"\" Stein said. Meanwhile, Virginia Tech scholar Janet Abbate says in her 1999 book \"\"Inventing the Internet,\"\" published by MIT Press, that even in the expansion of Arpanet , Americans enlisted the help of computer experts from England and France. She also points to Berners-Lee\u2019s contributions, saying, \"\"The history of the Internet is not \u2026 a story of a few heroic inventors; it is a tale of collaboration and conflict among a remarkable variety of players.\"\" The origins of e-mail, as you might expect, are entwined with the Internet. Electronic mail was part of the development of Arpanet in the early \u201870s, according to Stein, Abbate and others. American programmer Ray Tomlinson gets credit (and tongue-in-cheek blame) for the first working network mail program, picked up by users of Arpanet sites. Here's what Abbate told us when we asked her about Rubio's claim. \"\"I think it's an overstatement to call the Internet a purely American product. Certainly other countries were building their own computer networks (and inter-networks) in parallel with the U.S.; these other networks eventually became part of the Internet,\"\" Abbate said. \"\"Also, the Internet itself (as opposed to the earlier Apranet) was a collaborative effort with input from computer scientists in France and elsewhere, and I argue in my book that the diversity of input made the resulting system stronger. I do think the U.S. did a remarkably good job with the Internet design and expansion, maybe better than anyone else would or could have done. But if the resulting Internet hadn't suited other countries' needs, they were perfectly capable of creating their own networks (indeed, for a while there were a number of different competing network systems before TCP/IP eventually became the standard). \"\"And of course, the World Wide Web was invented at CERN, not in the US or by an American. So does that mean we in the U.S. are enjoying the benefits of the \"\"Swiss miracle\"\" every time we use the Web?\"\" GPS  The satellite technology that puts some of the smart in your smart phone and informs your car\u2019s navigation system is a system of satellites funded by taxpayers and operated by the U.S. government. So calling the global positioning system an \"\"American miracle\"\" is no stretch. The technology was born at Aerospace Corp., a military research contractor in El Segundo, Calif. Its founding president was New York native Ivan Getting. That isn\u2019t to say there aren\u2019t foreign navigation satellites. The United States cooperates with Australia, China, the European Union, India, Japan and Russia on global navigation satellite systems, sometimes referred to as GNSS. But Rubio said GPS, and the history there is fairly clear -cut. The ruling  What to make of all of this? Rubio's basic point, that the technology behind mobile phones, e-mail, the Internet and GPS all have American roots, holds up. It\u2019s true \"\"in a general sense,\"\" said Sherry Turkle, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who writes on our relationship with technology. Or, as the University of Memphis professor, Stein, put it: \"\"The statement is superficially correct, but there is (as usual) more to the story.\"\" Stein was most concerned about the non-American role in the development of the Internet, especially the substantial contribution of England's Berners-Lee. It\u2019s also important to note in the context of Rubio\u2019s \"\"only in America\"\" rhetoric that while the United States led, it wasn\u2019t alone in its innovation. Other nations\u2019 researchers contributed to the early Internet; commercial mobile phone networks were available overseas before they were in America; other nations operate satellite navigation systems. But in these areas and many others, Americans can claim primacy.\"", "output": "Anywhere in the world, when someone uses a mobile phone, e-mail, the Internet or GPS, they are enjoying the benefits of the American miracle.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "The state\u2019s health secretary, Dr. Rachel Levine, announced the death Friday and said Pennsylvania has also reported nine confirmed cases to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The investigation found some schools and day care centers had lead levels so high that researchers noted it could impact children\u2019s health. Exacerbating the problem, many water providers aren\u2019t testing at all. It wasn\u2019t the Canadian government that exposed the scope of this public health concern. A yearlong investigation by more than 120 journalists from nine universities and 10 media organizations, including The Associated Press and the Institute for Investigative Journalism at Concordia University in Montreal , collected test results that properly measure exposure to lead in 11 cities across Canada. Out of 12,000 tests since 2014, one-third \u2014 33% \u2014 exceeded the national safety guideline of 5 parts per billion; 18% exceeded the U.S. limit of 15 ppb. In a country that touts its clean, natural turquoise lakes, sparkling springs and rushing rivers, there are no national mandates to test drinking water for lead. And even if agencies do take a sample, residents are rarely informed of contamination. \u201cI\u2019m surprised,\u201d said Bruce Lanphear, a leading Canadian water safety researcher who studies the impacts of lead exposure on fetuses and young children. \u201cThese are quite high given the kind of attention that has been given to Flint, Michigan, as having such extreme problems. Even when I compare this to some of the other hotspots in the United States, like Newark, like Pittsburgh, the levels here are quite high.\u201d Many Canadians who had allowed journalists to sample their water were troubled when they came back with potentially dangerous lead levels. Some private homeowners said they plan to stop drinking from the tap. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit disturbing to see that there\u2019s that much,\u201d said Andrew Keddie, a retired professor who assumed his water was clean after replacing pipes years ago at his home in Edmonton, a city of almost 1 million in western Canada. What he couldn\u2019t do is replace public service lines delivering water to his house. After learning his water lead levels tested at 28 ppb, Keddie said he was \u201cconcerned enough that we won\u2019t be drinking and using this water.\u201d Sarah Rana, 18, was one of tens of thousands of students who weren\u2019t alerted when her brick high school in Oakville, a town on the shores of Lake Ontario, found lead levels above national guidelines in dozens of water samples, the highest at 140 ppb. She found out on her own, looking at reports posted online. \u201cI was getting poisoned for four years and did not know about it,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a student, I think I should be told.\u201d Leona Peterson learned of the contamination in her water after journalists found excessively high lead levels in 21 of 25 homes tested in her small, northwest port town of Prince Rupert. Peterson, who lives in subsidized housing for Indigenous people, had water that registered at 15.6 ppb. \u201cI was drinking from the tap, directly from the tap, without any knowledge that there was lead in the water,\u201d said Peterson. Her son was as well. Her response: \u201cHurt, real hurt.\u201d The town of Prince Rupert, where whales, grizzly bears and bald eagles are common sights, is among more than a dozen communities along Canada\u2019s wild west coast where residents \u2014 many Indigenous \u2014 are living in homes with aging pipes, drinking corrosive rainwater that is likely to draw lead. But their province of British Columbia doesn\u2019t require municipalities to test tap water for lead. Canadian officials where levels were high said they were aware that lead pipes can contaminate drinking water and that they were working to replace aging infrastructure. And some localities are taking action. Montreal Mayor Val\u00e9rie Plante vowed to test 100,000 homes for lead and speed up replacement of lead-lined pipes immediately after journalists sent her an analysis of the city\u2019s internal data revealing high lead levels across the city. The media consortium filed more than 700 Freedom of Information requests and took hundreds of samples in people\u2019s homes to collect more than 79,000 water test results. But the findings are neither comprehensive nor an indication of overall drinking water quality in Canada. That doesn\u2019t exist. \u201cBecause there is no federal oversight, everybody does what they want,\u201d said engineering professor Mich\u00e8le Pr\u00e9vost, who quit working on a government study of school drinking water in frustration over the lack of lead testing. \u201cMost provinces ignore this very serious problem.\u201d The government\u2019s approach to limiting lead in drinking water in Canada is starkly different from the U.S., where the Environmental Protection Agency sets legal standards under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, and every person is supposed to receive an annual Consumer Confidence Report from their water provider by July 1 detailing lead test results. There\u2019s no similar, routine testing or notice in Canada, with the exception of the 14 million-person province of Ontario, bordering the U.S. and the Great Lakes, which post results online. \u201cIf that\u2019s not public, that\u2019s a problem,\u201d said Tom Neltner, a chemical engineer at the Environmental Defense Fund, a U.S.-based environmental group. \u201cThe public is more sensitive to the risks of lead, especially on children\u2019s development. Where you have transparency you have advocacy, and where you have advocacy you have action.\u201d In the U.S., however, even public water quality reports weren\u2019t enough to prevent the Flint, Michigan, drinking water crisis, brought on by a 2014 decision to temporarily pull water from a river as a cost saver while installing new pipelines. Some doctors raised concerns in Flint after noticing elevated lead levels in children\u2019s blood tests. Flint\u2019s water problems went well beyond lead: Excessive microbes turned the water reddish brown and led to a Legionnaires\u2019 disease outbreak that caused at least 12 deaths and sickened more than 90 people. The Flint crisis sparked congressional hearings, lawsuits and scrutiny of lead testing across the country. Now officials in Newark, New Jersey, are scrambling to replace about 18,000 lead lines after repeated tests found elevated lead levels in drinking water. Other communities are also responding. Nearly 30 million people in the U.S. were supplied drinking water that had excessively high levels of lead, from Portland, Oregon to Providence, Rhode Island between 2015 and 2018, according to an analysis of EPA data by the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. Hundreds of people in the U.S. are suing local water authorities over the contamination. Virginia Tech professor Marc Edwards, whose study of the Flint water system helped reveal the dangerous lead levels, reviewed the Canadian media consortium\u2019s findings. \u201cThis is a significant health concern, people should be warned,\u201d said Edwards. \u201cSomething should be done.\u201d In Canada, where lawsuits are less frequent and provinces \u2014 not the federal government \u2014 set water safety rules, the main source of lead in drinking water is antiquated pipes. At one government hearing, an expert estimated some 500,000 lead service lines are still delivering water to people in the country. Some cities, like Montreal, are already working to replace them, tearing up streets and sidewalks with massive and expensive construction. But homeowners are almost always responsible for paying the cost of replacing the section of pipe between their property lines to their homes, a cost that can range from about $3,000 to $15,000, according to provincial studies. Several other short-term solutions include having suppliers add anti-corrosives or altering water chemistry so it\u2019s less likely to leach lead from the insides of pipes as it heads for the tap. These are widely used and often mandatory in the U.S., but in Canada only the province of Ontario requires anti-corrosives in communities with older buildings and sewerage. Studies have documented over years that even low levels of lead exposure can affect a child\u2019s IQ and their ability to pay attention. Children who are younger than 7 and pregnant women are most at risk from lead exposure, which can damage brains and kidneys. Yet the consortium\u2019s investigation found day cares and schools are not tested regularly. And when they are tested, those results are also not public. Documents obtained under the Freedom of Information laws included a 2017 pilot study of tap water at 150 day cares in the picturesque, lake-laden province of Alberta. It showed 18 had lead levels in drinking water at or above 5 ppb, which the researchers considered risky for the infants and toddlers. The highest was 35.5 ppb. Canada is one of the only developed countries in the world that does not have a nationwide drinking water standard. Even countries that struggle to provide safe drinking water have established acceptable lead levels: India\u2019s is 10 ppb and Mexico and Egypt\u2019s are 5 ppb, according to those country\u2019s government websites. Joe Cotruvo, a D.C.-based environmental and public health consultant active in the World Health Organization\u2019s work on drinking water guidelines, hadn\u2019t realized that some provinces in Canada don\u2019t routinely test tap water for lead. \u201cReally? No kidding,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the U.S., if there is a federal regulation, states are required to implicate it. If they don\u2019t, they\u2019re functioning illegally.\u201d Drinking water testing and treatment methods are also inconsistent in Canada. In the U.S., in-home tests are taken first thing in the morning, after water has stagnated in pipes for at least six hours. This provides a worst-case scenario, because after water runs through pipes for a while, lead levels often decline. In Canada, provinces have set their own rules, which range from not testing at all, to requiring a sample to stagnate before testing. Few are treating the drinking water itself to lower lead levels. Maura Allaire, an assistant professor of water economics and policy at University of California, Irvine, was surprised Canada\u2019s major water suppliers aren\u2019t routinely required to add anti-corrosives to drinking water. \u201cYikes, I could imagine in older cities if they\u2019re not doing corrosion control what can happen when acidic water touches lead pipes in homes,\u201d she said. She recommends Canadian officials start to address the problem by collecting better information. \u201cOnce you have better information, there can be targeted efforts, to really try to prevent corrosion,\u201d she said. \u201cThe big discussion in the U.S. among politicians is to replace the pipes, but that takes time and is costly. If there\u2019s lead in the water, you\u2019ve got a public health problem that needs to be dealt with now.\u201d ___ The Institute for Investigative Journalism at Concordia University in Montreal members: concordia.ca/watercredits", "output": "Investigation: Lead in some Canadian water worse than Flint.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "Homebred beef cattle are seen at a local cattle market in Hongseong, about 170 km (106 miles) south of Seoul July 29, 2008. A rare genetic mutation may underlie some cases of mad cow disease in cattle and its discovery may help shed light on where the epidemic started, U.S. researchers reported on Friday. REUTERS/Lee Jae-Won The mutation, in an Alabama cow that tested positive in 2006 for bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, is identical to one that causes a related brain-wasting disease in humans. This suggests BSE may sometimes arise spontaneously in cattle. Jurgen Richt of Kansas State University said cattle producers must never let down their guard against BSE because cattle anywhere, at any time, can develop the disease. The finding may support a 2005 theory that the BSE epidemic in cattle could be traced to feed contaminated with cattle remains from India, the researchers report in the Public Library of Science journal PLoS Pathogens. BSE or mad cow disease swept through British dairy herds in the 1980s, forcing the destruction of millions of animals. No one ever found where it came from but most experts thought at the time it came from cattle feed that contained the remains of sheep infected with a similar disease called scrapie. Cattle were never known to develop BSE before the epidemic, but some experts have argued they may have. This report lends credence to that idea. BSE, scrapie and a human version called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or CJD, are brain-destroying illnesses called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. In some cases, animals or people that eat brain and nervous system material from victims of these diseases can develop them, too. They are passed along by misfolded infectious protein fragments called prions. A very rare disease called variant CJD has been found in people who ate infected beef products. Fatal and incurable, it has affected just 167 people so far. Most countries now ban the use of meat and other parts from mammals in food for cattle. They also ban the use of potentially infectious tissues such as brain and spinal cord in human food. \u201cThere are tendencies around the world, now that the feed-borne epidemic has gone down, to relax these rules and regulations,\u201d Richt said in a telephone interview. \u201cSo if we have these genetic cases popping up here and there and we don\u2019t have our mitigations in place, we will have another epidemic somewhere.\u201d   He suggested breeding the gene out of cattle. \u201cWe can clean the world cattle herd of that mutation,\u201d Richt said. CJD is also known to pop up spontaneously in the human population. A genetic mutation causes the disease in one in a million people globally. Richt and colleagues tested the brain of the Alabama cow and found a mutation identical to the prion gene mutation that causes some cases of CJD.

Nace said Wheeler failed to follow the regulations outlined in the Black Lung Benefits Act for years, causing two West Virginia coal miners \u2014 Michael Day and Junior McCoy Barr \u2014 to lose significant amounts of money in compensation. Both men later died of black lung disease. James Mathias, arguing on behalf of Johns Hopkins and Wheeler, said the case \u201cbegins and ends\u201d with witness immunity, which shields witnesses from later civil liability. Judge J.

The proposed class-action lawsuit filed by the families of Day and Barr cited a 2013 investigation by the Center for Public Integrity and ABC News reporting that Wheeler did not apply the required guidelines for evaluating X-rays of patients to determine if they had black lung disease. The series, which won a Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting, found that in at least 280 cases in which Wheeler convinced an administrative law judge to deny benefits, autopsies later showed the miners had the disease and were entitled to benefits.

Multiple news reports -- and Comedy Central\u2019s The Colbert Report -- recounted the tale of Abbott\u2019s arrest, which reignited a long-running debate about how the city should handle the homeless population downtown and at the beach. On Nov. 5, Fort Lauderdale Mayor Jack Seiler issued a statement in which he said he wanted to \"\"set the record straight\"\" about the city\u2019s services for homeless. He said that the media had misrepresented the facts. \"\"Contrary to reports,\"\" Seiler wrote, \"\"the City of Fort Lauderdale is not banning groups from feeding the homeless.\"\" Seiler said outdoor feeding is legal, but added that a new city law regulates the activity. Then Seiler addressed the situation regarding Abbott: \"\"At two recent outdoor food distributions, citations were rightly issued for non-compliance with the process enacted to ensure public health and safety. Contrary to what was reported in the media, no one was taken into custody. ...\"\" As the public-relations crisis escalated, Seiler gave multiple interviews to the media. On CNN Nov. 11, Seiler said Abbott \"\"was not arrested and taken into custody.\"\" At PolitiFact Florida we agree with Seiler\u2019s goal of setting the record straight. Was Abbott taken into custody? Fort Lauderdale\u2019s laws about the homeless Abbott\u2019s battle with the city has brought notoriety to Seiler, a former state representative who has been mentioned as a future statewide candidate for the Democrats. Seiler faces re-election to a third term in March. So far, no one has filed to run against him. Abbott, who founded an interfaith volunteer organization Love Thy Neighbor to help the homeless, has been battling city leaders for more than a decade. In 1999, the city tried to ban him from holding picnics for the homeless at the beach, offering him an alternative site miles away from downtown. But Abbott prevailed in court when a judge ruled that the city had violated his religious rights and that the city\u2019s new location was too remote. Abbott resumed his feedings and resumed them in visible locations in Stranahan Park in downtown and along the beach. The battle has continued in recent years, with the commission passing a series of laws that attempted to regulate the homeless population, including a ban on soliciting for money at intersections and tougher laws against defecating in public. City officials, including Seiler, have argued that while the homeless should have access to services, including meals, they have heard complaints from some businesses and residents about the homeless population in downtown. Advocates have decried city officials for cracking down on the homeless with a series of laws. At an Oct. 21 meeting, the commission approved the ordinance about outdoor food distribution over the objection of protesters. The ordinance, approved by the Commission 4-1, codified a list of rules for outdoor food distribution, including that sites must be 500 feet away from residential areas, have bathrooms or portable toilets, equipment for hand washing and consent of the owner. The law allows indoor feedings at houses of worship. \"\"You have to balance the interests of everybody in the community,\"\" Seiler told PolitiFact Florida. \"\"What we always try to do is make sure everybody gets to enjoy our parks. Every single thing we have done with the ordinance is a balance.\"\" But while the law itself doesn\u2019t technically ban outdoor feedings, it raises the bar for groups such as Abbott\u2019s in a way that makes it almost impossible to clear. (Abbott argues that the requirement that he get a port-a-potty should be moot since a public restroom is nearby and he says volunteers wash their hands before feedings and use gloves.) At the time of Seiler\u2019s statement, Abbott had three run-ins with law enforcement related to the outdoor feedings: on Oct. 6, Nov. 2 and Nov. 5, police reports show. (The October arrest predated the new ordinance but the city already had a separate law banning social services in the parks.) On the first two occasions, Abbott was given a warning but then continued with the feedings. The third time, Abbott agreed to end the food distribution that day, police reports say. In none of the three instances was he handcuffed or taken to jail. Instead, he was given notices to appear in court. (In one police report, it states that Abbott shook the police officer\u2019s hand before he left.) At least one other person helping with the feedings was also arrested in a similar manner. A city spokesman told PolitiFact Florida that the case stemming from the Nov. 2 arrest has been filed in court. The city has generally avoided referring to Abbott\u2019s case as an \"\"arrest,\"\" but his attorney John David said that just because it\u2019s not a \"\"custodial arrest\"\" doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not an arrest. For minor crimes, police use this type of arrest and give defendants notices to appear as long as the person has a connection to the area and is likely to show up in court. Nonetheless, \"\"it's an arrest, no doubt about that,\"\" David said. \"\"He is charged with a criminal offense.\"\" Fort Lauderdale police Capt. Rick Maglione told PolitiFact Florida that \"\"It is similar to a misdemeanor arrest, but we do not have to take the person physically into custody and they can just show up in court and let a judge decide the case.\"\" We interviewed a few criminal defense lawyers in South Florida not involved in the case and they agreed that the police did indeed arrest Abbott. \"\"With all due respect to the mayor, it is an arrest,\"\" said Brian Tannebaum, a Miami criminal defense lawyer. \"\"The fact that someone is not taken into custody does not make it something other than an arrest. Misdemeanor cases are handled with promises to appear all the time. The officer has discretion to take someone into custody, but even if they don't it is still considered an arrest.\"\" City spokesman Chaz Adams told PolitiFact that although a notice to appear is technically an arrest, \"\"the mayor has been consistent in saying that Mr. Abbott was not \"\"arrested and taken into custody.\"\" Abbott faces up to a $500 fine and 60 days in jail for each offense. However, lawyers say it\u2019s unlikely that a judge will throw him behind bars. \"\"I can\u2019t imagine anyone putting Arnold in jail,\"\" said Broward public defender Howard Finkelstein. His office is not handling the case, but he has praised Abbott. Abbott\u2019s lawyer filed a motion in Broward court on Nov. 12 that asked a judge to enforce the injunction from the earlier case that allowed Abbott to continue the feedings. The city offered Abbott two alternative sites -- at the city\u2019s aquatic complex near the beach, and at Church by the Sea, located near the beach -- but he rejected both. \"\"I plan to continue my feedings at the same site I have used for the past 23 years,\"\" Abbott told PolitiFact Florida in an email. Seiler says it\u2019s not his call what penalty Abbott faces. \"\"We have to enforce the laws, we have to be consistent,\"\" Seiler told PolitiFact Florida. \"\"What the courts do with Mr. Abbott -- that\u2019s up to the courts.\"\" Seiler has defended his city\u2019s reputation for serving the homeless, which includes working with nonprofits to provide services and allowing the county-run Homeless Assistance center to expand. The city\u2019s police department also has a homeless outreach unit. Fort Lauderdale\u2019s law about feeding the homeless is part of a growing national trend. Since 2007, 71 cities have attempted or enacted some type of rules related to food-sharing activities, according to the National Coalition for the Homeless. \"\"The best solution to the food-sharing issue is to have indoor meal programs available to the homeless three times a day, seven days a week,\"\" said Michael Stoops, director of community organizing National Coalition for the Homeless. \"\"If these locations were located conveniently in Downtown Fort Lauderdale, a good number of the homeless would opt to eat inside vs. outside. However, food-sharing with the homeless in public spaces would still be needed.\"\" Our ruling Seiler said that \"\"no one was taken into custody\"\" for feeding the homeless. Seiler is correct that Abbott wasn\u2019t taken into custody -- the activist was not handcuffed or taken to jail but was instead given a notice to appear in court. But his carefully worded claim glosses over the fact that Abbott was indeed arrested on more than one occasion for allegedly feeding the homeless in violation of city ordinances, something that leaves Abbott at least theoretically in peril of being sentenced to jail.

Last month, the agency sent an alert to 25,000 Massachusetts health care providers asking them to voluntarily report pulmonary-related disease associated with vaping. \u201cToday\u2019s action establishes the legal framework for health care providers to report cases and suspected cases so that we can get a better sense of the overall burden of disease in Massachusetts,\u201d Bharel said in a written statement. She said the reporting will also help the state provide case counts to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as they to try to understand the nationwide impact of vaping. U.S. health officials are investigating what might be causing hundreds of serious breathing illnesses in people who use e-cigarettes and vaping devices. They have identified about 450 possible cases in 33 states, including six deaths. Massachusetts is actively investigating several suspected vaping-associated pulmonary cases. There have been no confirmed Massachusetts cases. The last time the state health commissioner issued a similar mandate was two years ago. That mandate required providers to report cases of amnesia associated with intravenous drug use. The new mandate was sent to all clinicians \u2014 including internal medicine, family practice, general practice, emergency medicine, and clinical care \u2014 in Massachusetts as well as pediatricians, pulmonologists, and nurse practitioners. It asks providers to report any case of a person experiencing otherwise unexplained progressive symptoms of shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, cough, or weight loss, of any severity, and an abnormal chest imaging study associated with vaping. In the cases reported to the CDC, patients experienced coughing, shortness of breath, and fatigue. Symptoms worsened days or weeks before they were admitted to a hospital. Other symptoms reported by some patients included fever, anorexia, pleuritic chest pain, nausea, and diarrhea. All the patients had reported vaping in the weeks and months before going to the hospital. No specific product has been identified in all cases, nor has any product been conclusively linked to the clinical syndrome. According to the state health department, 41% of Massachusetts high school students have tried e-cigarettes at least once. About 20% of them reported using e-cigarettes in the past 30 days \u2014 a rate six times higher than adults. Nearly 10% of middle school students say they have tried e-cigarettes. A 2018 law signed by Gov. Charlie Baker includes e-cigarettes into the definition of tobacco, making it illegal to vape where it is illegal to smoke.

Scientists have long been able to make specific changes in the DNA code. Now, they\u2019re taking the more radical step of starting over, and building redesigned life forms from scratch. Boeke, a researcher at New York University, directs an international team of 11 labs on four continents working to \u201crewrite\u201d the yeast genome, following a detailed plan they published in March. Their work is part of a bold and controversial pursuit aimed at creating custom-made DNA codes to be inserted into living cells to change how they function, or even provide a treatment for diseases. It could also someday help give scientists the profound and unsettling ability to create entirely new organisms. The genome is the entire genetic code of a living thing. Learning how to make one from scratch, Boeke said, means \u201cyou really can construct something that\u2019s completely new.\u201d The research may reveal basic, hidden rules that govern the structure and functioning of genomes. But it also opens the door to life with new and useful characteristics, like microbes or mammal cells that are better than current ones at pumping out medications in pharmaceutical factories, or new vaccines. The right modifications might make yeast efficiently produce new biofuels, Boeke says. Some scientists look further into the future and see things like trees that purify water supplies and plants that detect explosives at airports and shopping malls. Also on the horizon is redesigning human DNA. That\u2019s not to make genetically altered people, scientists stress. Instead, the synthetic DNA would be put into cells, to make them better at pumping out pharmaceutical proteins, for example, or perhaps to engineer stem cells as a safer source of lab-grown tissue and organs for transplanting into patients. Some have found the idea of remaking human DNA disconcerting, and scientists plan to get guidance from ethicists and the public before they try it. Still, redesigning DNA is alarming to some. Laurie Zoloth of Northwestern University, a bioethicist who\u2019s been following the effort, is concerned about making organisms with \u201cproperties we cannot fully know.\u201d And the work would disturb people who believe creating life from scratch would give humans unwarranted power, she said. \u201cIt is not only a science project,\u201d Zoloth said in an email. \u201cIt is an ethical and moral and theological proposal of significant proportions.\u201d Rewritten DNA has already been put to work in viruses and bacteria. Australian scientists recently announced that they\u2019d built the genome of the Zika virus in a lab, for example, to better understand it and get clues for new treatments. At Harvard University, Jeffrey Way and Pamela Silver are working toward developing a harmless strain of salmonella to use as a vaccine against food poisoning from salmonella and E. coli, as well as the diarrhea-causing disease called shigella. A key goal is to prevent the strain from turning harmful as a result of picking up DNA from other bacteria. That requires changing its genome in 30,000 places. \u201cThe only practical way to do that,\u201d Way says, \u201cis to synthesize it from scratch.\u201d The cutting edge for redesigning a genome, though, is yeast. Its genome is bigger and more complex than the viral and bacterial codes altered so far. But it\u2019s well-understood and yeast will readily swap man-made DNA for its own. Still, rewriting the yeast genome is a huge job. It\u2019s like a chain with 12 million chemical links, known by the letters, A, C, G and T. That\u2019s less than one-hundredth the size of the human genome, which has 3.2 billion links. But it\u2019s still such a big job that Boeke\u2019s lab and scientists in the United States, Australia, China, Singapore, and the United Kingdom are splitting up the work. By the time the new yeast genome is completed, researchers will have added, deleted or altered about a million DNA letters. Boeke compares a genome to a book with many chapters, and researchers are coming out with a new edition, with chapters that allow the book to do something it couldn\u2019t do before. To redesign a particular stretch of yeast DNA, scientists begin with its sequence of code letters \u2014 nature\u2019s own recipe. They load that sequence into a computer, then tell the computer to make specific kinds of changes. For example one change might let them rearrange the order of genes, which might reveal strategies to make yeast grow better, says NYU researcher Leslie Mitchell. Once the changes are made, the new sequence used as a blueprint. It is sent to a company that builds chunks of DNA containing the new sequence. Then these short chunks are joined together in the lab to build ever longer strands. The project has so far reported building about one-third of the yeast genome. Boeke hopes the rest of the construction will be done by the end of the year. But he says it will take longer to test the new DNA and fix problems, and to finally combine the various chunks into a complete synthetic genome. Last year, Boeke and others announced a separate effort, what is now called Genome Project-write or GP-write . It is chiefly focused on cutting the cost of building and testing large genomes, including human ones, by more than 1,000-fold within 10 years. The project is still seeking funding. In the meantime, leaders of GP-write have started discussions of ethical, legal and social issues. And they realize the idea of making a human genome is a sensitive one. \u201cThe notion that we could actually write a human genome is simultaneously thrilling to some and not so thrilling to others,\u201d Boeke said. \u201cSo we recognize this is going to take a lot of discussion.\u201d ___ Follow Malcolm Ritter at @MalcolmRitter.

An estimated five to 20 percent of heart patients are intolerant of statin medications for lowering cholesterol due to side effects such as muscle weakness or fatigue, Amgen said. Evolocumab belongs to a class of medicine called PCSK9 inhibitors that work by blocking a protein that reduces the liver\u2019s ability to remove LDL cholesterol from the blood. Based on dramatic LDL lowering demonstrated by Amgen and other companies in earlier studies, PCSK9 inhibitors could be the most important new heart drugs to come along in several years with multibillion-dollar sales potential. The injected medicines are likely to be used in high risk heart patients unable to lower their LDL levels sufficiently with high doses of widely used statin drugs, such as Pfizer\u2019s Lipitor, and in those unable to take statins. Many patients remain at high risk of heart attack and stroke \u201cdespite the use of all available therapies,\u201d Amgen research and development chief Sean Harper said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe ability to treat those individuals with a completely distinct mechanism and see this very large effect size of dropping LDL cholesterol by roughly 50 percent, that\u2019s a pretty big deal for those patients,\u201d Harper said. The company expects during the current quarter to have results of its final two Phase III studies - one in patients already taking high doses of statins and one in patients genetically predisposed to dangerously high cholesterol levels. Amgen will provide details of its latest 307-patient Phase III study, called GAUSS-2, which compared evolocumab to Merck & Co\u2019s Zetia (ezetimibe), at an upcoming medical meeting. However, the world\u2019s largest biotech company said the percentage of cholesterol lowering was consistent with those observed in a similar, smaller Phase II trial. In that study, evolocumab led to 51 percent reduction in LDL levels and 63 percent when combined with Zetia versus a 15 percent reduction seen with Zetia alone. \u201cIt\u2019s very unusual to have a therapeutic that addresses one of the underlying factors that drive the greatest mortality risk that exists in Western countries, and increasingly in developing countries - cardiovascular disease driven by atherosclerosis,\u201d Harper said.

But the release\u2019s lack of discussion on that point shouldn\u2019t be enough for a Not Satisfactory rating \u2014 we\u2019ll rule it Not Applicable. This release described\u00a0a large, multi-center, randomized trial where those analyzing the data were blinded to information that might influence their findings. It gave ample information about the study design, it\u2019s relationship to the larger cardiovascular study from which it is derived,\u00a0and the size, scope, age and body mass of the participants. The release also does a good job following the research paper\u2019s example of delineating the weaknesses of the study. It even quotes the cautionary language included in an accompanying editorial. This release offers no evidence of disease-mongering. The release only offers the following statement as an endnote: \u201cAuthors made conflict of interest and funding/support disclosures. Please see the article for additional information, including other authors, author contributions and affiliations, financial disclosures.\u201d\u00a0 The paper itself points to numerous connections between the researchers and sponsors which would have an obvious vested interest in the study\u2019s outcome. These include grants as well as free supplies of the foods supplemented in the study. While this doesn\u2019t call the findings into question, disclosing this information in a release of this type provides transparency that readers appreciate and should expect. The release offers no real alternatives to the diets studied but it is reasonable to assume that readers can compare these examples with their own diets and make decisions accordingly. And while there are other approaches to cancer prevention that arguably could have been discussed (screening mammography, for example), we don\u2019t really think a release about a diet study should be expected to address those approaches. It\u2019s clear from the release that the foods in the Mediterranean diet are widely available. However, it might be harder to find certain component foods like fish, fresh fruits and vegetables, and extra virgin olive oil in some places in the U.S. (i.e. \u201cfood deserts\u201d). The release could have acknowledged this. The release establishes that the effects of diet on breast cancer risk have been studied previously with this line: \u201cDiet has been extensively studied as a modifiable risk factor in the development of breast cancer but epidemiologic evidence on the effect of specific dietary factors is inconsistent.\u201d There is no unjustifiable language in this release.", "output": "Mediterranean diet plus olive oil associated with reduced breast cancer risk", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "The Kansas Department of Health and Environment announced Wednesday it is partnering with Count the Kicks, a stillbirth prevention public health campaign.

We liked that the story took pains to explain that approval of this drug faces many hurdles. This is a tough one. While the story tells us what percentage of patients benefited from treatment, it does not, in fact, quantify the extent of those benefits\u2013which is precisely what this category is designed to assess. However, the story does do a good\u2013and thorough\u2013job of describing the benefits in qualitative terms. That said, if the story had only chosen one or two examples of changes in the standardized measures of depression or anxiety, this would have received an enthusiastic \u201cSatisfactory\u201d rating. One strong word of caution though: The story cites one source as saying that psilocybin may one day be used to treat a wide range of mental health issues ranging from drug addiction to obsessive-compulsive disorder. The story offers no evidence to support these claims, which were made by a source associated with an organization that exists specifically to promote research on hallucinogens. Substantial claims require substantial evidence. The story would have been much stronger if it had eliminated the unsubstantiated remarks from the source \u2014 particularly since they had no bearing on the subject of the story. The story addresses this issue thoroughly. Well done. The story does a good job of both describing the design of the studies and explaining why the study design is relevant. For example, the story notes: \u201cBut both [studies] were considered to be double-blind placebo trials \u2014 the gold-standard of medical research in which subjects are left to guess whether they have gotten the active study drug or an inactive lookalike.\u201d This is the sort of thing we like to see. However, we did want to note that in the NYU study, researchers did state in the limitations section that there was \u201climited blinding\u201d \u2014 how did that possibly affect the outcomes? No disease mongering here. However, the story should have been more cautious about claims of benefit for conditions ranging far beyond the scope of the research at hand, which focused on mental health problems among people with advanced cancer. The story clearly states who funded the studies, and what that organization\u2019s long-term goals are. Further, the story clearly identified individuals quoted in the story who have ties to the studies or the funding organization. Lastly, the story incorporates input from an independent expert. However, the story would have been stronger if there had been a skeptical take on the research, which saw\u00a0in some other coverage, such as this New York Times piece. The story does not address other treatment options for anxiety or depression, such as talk therapy or other pharmaceutical interventions. The story does a good job here. For example, the story notes: \u201c[F]inding drugs like psilocybin effective is by no means the final hurdle to their widespread availability. None are currently in production, and no for-profit pharmaceutical company would likely invest millions of dollars to bring to market a pill intended effectively for one-time use.\u201d Well done. This is a close call. The story does do a good job of placing the work in context in regard to overall research involving hallucinogens. That\u2019s enough to earn it a \u201cSatisfactory\u201d rating. However, the story doesn\u2019t mention any of the work done in the past 10 years on the use of psilocybin specifically to address anxiety in cancer patients, such as this 2007 study, this one from 2011, or this one from 2013. Are the results from the two new studies consistent with these earlier findings? Do they differ in a meaningful way? That would be good to know.

Chhabria, who oversees some 900 federal Roundup lawsuits, on April 11 ordered the parties to start confidential mediation. He appointed Feinberg after the parties failed to agree on a mediator. Feinberg is well known for having facilitated dispute resolutions in high-stakes litigations in the past. He led mediation talks over the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster, Volkswagen\u2019s diesel emissions scandal and General Motors ignition switch litigation. Chhabria on Wednesday also scheduled the next federal Roundup trial for February 2020. The case would mark the second bellwether, or test trial, to help determine the range of damages and define settlement options for federal cases. The judge also wants to prepare some 20 cases currently pending before him for trial and send them to other courts across the country. More than 13,400 plaintiffs nationwide allege Roundup caused non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and that the company failed to warn about that risk. The majority of lawsuits are pending in state courts across the country. Bayer, which acquired Roundup maker Monsanto in a $63 billion deal last year, denies the allegations, saying studies and regulators have deemed glyphosate and Roundup safe for human use. The company in the past said it would comply with Chhabria\u2019s mediation order in good faith, while believing strongly in the \u201cextensive body of reliable science supporting the safety of Roundup.\u201d  Bayer has also said it would defend itself in all cases and await the appeals process underway for the three cases that have gone to trial and resulted in jury verdicts against it. A California jury on May 13 awarded $2 billion to a couple alleging Roundup caused their cancer. In March, a federal jury in San Francisco awarded $80 million to a California man after finding Roundup caused his cancer. That decision came after another California jury in August 2018 awarded $289 million to a groundskeeper in the first U.S. Roundup trial.

Among women with a personal history of breast cancer, 1.7 %\u00a0were referred for\u00a0biopsies that determined there was no second\u00a0breast cancer while 1% of the women without breast cancer had false positive determinations. The article does point out that 18% of women with a personal history of breast cancer were called back for additional imaging or biopsies compared with 8.3% of those without breast cancer but there is no discussion of the psychological or financial costs connected with the additional imaging. By quantifying the benefits of screening mammography for women with a personal history of breast cancer in absolute numbers, the story presents this information accurately and in a useful, understandable way for women with breast cancer. The story\u00a0discusses false positives & interval cancers & provides explanations of both of these problems associated with screening mammography. The story does not explain that the study was a retrospective study based on mammograms performed from 1996-2007 in five states at facilities affiliated with the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. There is no mention in the story of the possible confounding factors such as the biological factors associated with treatment of the first cancers that were noted by the study authors. The story also fails to include information about the subgroups of women with the highest observed cancer rates for whom the study authors note that alternate screening might be considered. The headline of this story misleads the reader by stating that \u201cMammograms May Not Be Fool-Proof at Catching Second Cancers.\u201d\u00a0 No type of screening for breast cancer is fool-proof whether it is for an initial diagnosis or for a second breast\u00a0cancer. Regarding the accuracy of screening mammography for an initial breast cancer diagnosis, the Komen for the Cure website states that in women age 50 and older \u201c\u2026between six and 27 percent of breast cancers may be missed by mammography alone.\u201d\u00a0 Mammography is most effective in women 50 and older. Quotes from two independent sources are included in the article. Dr. William Audeh, director of the Wasserman Breast Cancer Risk Reduction Program at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center,\u00a0presents possible explanations for\u00a0some of the higher false positives among\u00a0women with a\u00a0personal history of breast cancer. Quotes from both Dr. Audeh and\u00a0Dr. Robert Smith, director of cancer screening for the American Cancer Society,\u00a0point out that screening mammography may not have been as effective among women with\u00a0a personal history of breast cancer as it was\u00a0in those without a breast\u00a0cancer\u00a0diagnosis but that most of the cancers detected were stage I or ductal carcinoma in situ, a non-invasive breast cancer. The article could have noted that study authors declared no conflicts of interest\u00a0and\u00a0\u00a0that the study was funded by a grant from the National Cancer Institute. Satisfactory mostly because of the inclusion of the comments by Dr Audeh about MRI, which is really the only acceptable alternative to mammography for followup of breast cancer survivors, and it is still unclear how MRI and mammography should be used in concert. Not applicable. Mammography is widely available and recommendations for annual mammography screening after a breast cancer diagnosis are standard. So the story didn\u2019t need to specifically discuss the availability. Satisfactory. The novelty of mammography is not in question, and the whole point of the story was the new study about mammography\u2019s performance in breast cancer survivors vs. controls. It may have been helpful for readers to know\u00a0that the study\u00a0was the first to examine the accuracy of screening mammography for women with a personal history of breast cancer.

The costs of intensive medical therapy can easily be identified. Using an online pharmacy we calculated the costs to be about $1,500 to $2,000 annually for medical therapy, using generic drugs. Using the Health Care\u00a0Blue Book, we found the average cost of coronary artery bypass sugery and hospitalization to be about $62,000. We think that this is important information for readers that should have been included. The quantification here was presented in such a way to make it clear to readers that there was no significant benefit found to surgical intervention, which is a fair conclusion to draw from the study. The story says, \u201cIn the Stich study, 41% of patients assigned to treatment with drugs alone died during the follow-up period, which averaged five years. That compared with a mortality rate of 36% among patients who received bypass surgery plus medication. Although the relative reduction in risk of death was 14%, the result didn\u2019t meet tests for statistical significance, meaning it could have resulted from chance alone.\u201d\u00a0That\u2019s a great way to describe the lack of statistical significance. It would have been even more powerful to show readers the actual number of patients who died in each group. The story provides great information about the study itself and about the overall state of the evidence supporting heart surgery. \u201cHow best to treat these patients has been fraught with uncertainty,\u201d is one of the more notable phrases from the story. It also says, \u201cMany patients aren\u2019t evaluated for heart surgery to treat diseased arteries because they don\u2019t suffer classic chest pain or because doctors worry that hearts weakened by heart failure won\u2019t benefit from the procedure. Other doctors recommend immediate bypass surgery despite a lack of vigorous studies to support that strategy.\u201d The story does not engage in disease-mongering and takes a very careful approach to describing the types of patients who would be affected by this study\u2019s results. We also like the way they provided snapshots of patients who were in both arms of the study \u2014 surgery and non-surgery \u2014 at the end of the story, making it clear, as the study did, that both routes can be equally successful. The story brings in some strong independent voices who help make sense of this complicated study: James Fang, a cardiologist at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study, Raymond Gibbons, a cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic, and Clyde Yancy, chief of cardiology at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine. Rarely do you see a story that spends as much time with independent experts as it does with the authors of the study. The story does a great job showing how the standard interventions for heart disease stacked up against each other in this study. We wish that some mention had been made of diet and exercise and that at least a sentence had been included about whether there might be differences in outcomes seen as a result of different medication patterns. The story doesn\u2019t make it clear what exactly the patients were taking. The story makes it clear that the range of treatments studied by the authors are widely available. The story makes it clear that there is a great need for more evidence in this field and that this study will be surprising to many clinicians because of a long-held assumption that surgery is the superior option. tudies published in the early 1990s supported the view that bypass surgery provided a better long term outcome.

The plan also would fund access to long-term contraceptives for low-income patients and study the possibility of Medicaid reimbursement for doula services. \u201cIt is unacceptable that in this country  and in our Commonwealth maternal mortality rates are on the rise,\u201d he said. \u201cThis disparity is greatest among black women, who have a maternal mortality rate two times that of white women, regardless of education or income status.\u201d Northam, a Democrat, established a new initiative in June intended to reduce the maternal mortality rate for black women. He said the budget proposals grew out of that work, which included a series of public input session held around the state. \u201cOur goal is that every mother and every infant survive\u201d to celebrate the baby\u2019s first birthday together, said Northam, a pediatric neurologist. The governor\u2019s budget includes nearly $4 million over two fiscal years to expand Medicaid coverage for women who are eligible only while they are pregnant. Coverage for those women currently extends 60 days from the end of a pregnancy. The additional funding would extend coverage until a year post-pregnancy and cover treatment for substance use disorders. State figures show the majority of pregnancy-associated deaths occurred more than 43 days from the end of the pregnancy and ensuring postpartum care would improve health outcomes, Northam said. The budget plan would allocate another $4 million to the state program that offers long-acting reversible contraception to low-income patients and $12.8 million to make home visit services eligible for Medicaid reimbursement. Northam said the plan also would call for the study of the best way to develop a Medicaid reimbursement model for doulas, who provide support to women and their partners during pregnancy, labor and the postpartum period. Aaliyah Samuel, a mother from northern Virginia who spoke after Northam\u2019s announcement, said she was grateful for the steps he was taking. She said she experienced discrimination from health care professionals during the birth of her first son, who did not survive. \u201cUnfortunately, my story is far too common among black women and women of color, not only here in Virginia but across the U.S.\u201d she said. Governors\u2019 budget proposals generally serve as a starting point for negotiations during the General Assembly session, which starts in January. The budget will be a top priority, and Northam\u2019s plan will likely get a warmer reception than the one he put forward a year ago. During last month\u2019s legislative elections, voters gave Democrats full control of the General Assembly for the first time in a generation.

Customers order remotely \u2013 on mobile phones or by computers in store \u2013 and employees seal the meals in bags and put them in a special spot for pickup without human contact, McDonald\u2019s says on its website. For delivery orders, drivers drop McDonald\u2019s packages at building entrances, disinfect their delivery bags and wash their hands more frequently. Drivers carry ID cards showing that they - and the people who made and packaged their food - had their body temperature scanned to prove they do not have a fever. \u201cWhile we look at how to further improve the process, the stepped-up preventive measures apply to all of our servicing channels,\u201d McDonald\u2019s said in a statement to Reuters. The flu-like virus has infected more than 68,500 people globally and killed 1,665 as of Sunday, mostly in the central Chinese province of Hubei. Some major Chinese cities still resemble ghost towns as China struggles to get its economy back on track after a prolonged Lunar New Year holiday. In early February, 83% of all stores on the Meituan-Dianping delivery platform - one of the largest in the country - were closed, according to Beijing-based data firm BigOne Lab. Earlier this month, China\u2019s National Health Commission recommended that deliveries limit contact. Starbucks suggests customers order coffee via its app and then wait outside its caf\u00e9s until they get a pick-up notice. Orders are placed on tables just inside caf\u00e9 entrances. If they do enter Starbucks locations, customers have their temperature taken at the door, as fever is one of the main symptoms of infection, and baristas wear masks. For delivery, Starbucks said it regularly sterilizes containers and that its delivery people have their temperature taken daily. Indoors staff must wash hands every 30 minutes, and public areas are sterilized every 2 hours. Starbucks delivery is provided by ele.me, owned by ecommerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. The measures illustrate how companies are quickly adapting in order to sell prepared food while keeping people safe. Yum China Holdings Inc rolled out contactless delivery on Jan. 30, with contactless pickup coming two days later at its KFC and Pizza Hut locations, the company said. There had been contactless delivery in China prior to the crisis, when couriers would drop packages at a consumer\u2019s door or lobby or place parcels in lockers for later pickup. But since the outbreak, many residential compounds are limiting access for drivers and asking customers to pick up their own packages. In transactions that previously would have involved one person handing a package to the other, the driver now puts the food down \u2013 on the back of a moped, for instance \u2013 and then steps back and waits for the customer to take it and leave. One customer, for example, asked a delivery person to put a parcel in the elevator and press the button for the designated floor. The customer grabbed the package when the doors opened - unaccompanied by the courier, according to a post on CCTV News\u2019 social media account on Weibo, said Allison Malmsten, a marketing strategy analyst at Daxue Consulting in Shanghai. The outbreak \u201credefines contactless food delivery,\u201d Malmsten said via email. Since the start of the outbreak, Yum China has closed more than 30% of its locations. There have been \u201csignificant interruptions,\u201d with sales off as much as 50% in those that remained open since the Lunar New Year holiday, versus the same time last year, Chief Financial Officer Ka Wai Yeung said in a Feb. 5 earnings call. The crisis has accelerated the rollout of Yum China\u2019s  contactless services in China, it said in a statement. \u201cThese services have been well-received by customers and are playing an important role in ensuring that our delivery business continues to hold up during this period of significantly reduced dine-in traffic,\u201d it said. Early during the epidemic, meal delivery took a hit because customers feared contact with drivers would put them at risk of infection, according to news reports. Cases of couriers being diagnosed with the virus after working for days arose in Shenzhen and Qingdao cities. The companies\u2019 reliance on pickup and delivery to offset some losses does, however, have limitations. Malmsten said many drivers cannot return to work due to travel restrictions, and those who can return face long hours and physical and mental fatigue.

The explanation CEO Bill Johnson offered the Capitol hearing room: Several smaller outages that PG&E triggered in the year before its debacle began in mid-October went well, giving his company misplaced confidence. \u201cI think we got a little complacent that we had figured it out,\u201d Johnson testified last month. PG&E had not figured it out. An Associated Press review shows widespread problems with the four \u201cpublic safety power shutoffs\u201d the utility started rolling out in 2018, a year before massive blackouts paralyzed much of California in recent months. Interviews and documents obtained under public records requests reveal persistent failures and broken promises that in some cases compromised public safety. Even as PG&E assured regulators it was fixing the problems, the utility kept making many of the same mistakes, further undermining trust after its outdated equipment and negligence has been blamed for fires that killed nearly 130 people during 2017 and 2018. Communication, a foundation of emergency management, was poor. PG&E\u2019s notifications of impending outages were haphazard at times, with some sent after the power was already out. Telecommunications companies, water providers and emergency managers did not always receive the early word they needed. \u201cWe were surprised that PG&E provided no advanced warning to us,\u201d an official with the city of Oroville\u2019s drinking water provider wrote state regulators about a June outage. PG&E made important information hard to get. It was slow to distribute electronic maps showing who would lose power, making it harder for emergency responders to know exactly where to send resources. The utility also balked at providing the addresses of medically needy customers to local officials who planned to check on them in person. Breakdowns afflicted even basic technology. In a region that\u2019s home to Silicon Valley and its thousands of computer programmers and engineers, PG&E had not prepared the website where it posted outage updates for a crush of customers, so it crashed. Tech experts from the state had to intervene. The sound quality of some calls PG&E hosted during shutoffs was so poor that emergency responders and legislators had a hard time understanding updates. Even then, not everyone was invited. \u201cIn the future, AT&T requests that it and other communications providers be included on any conference calls providing real time information,\u201d the telecommunications giant protested to regulators after the June shutoff. These and other early failures weren\u2019t widely recognized as harbingers of the issues that would overwhelm PG&E come mid-October, partly because the outages affected rural areas with less political and economic clout. While the headline-making shutoffs affected more than 2 million people across much of PG&E\u2019s 70,000-square-mile service territory, the four initial blackouts affected tens of thousands in Northern California\u2019s Sierra Nevada foothills and famed wine valleys. They hit in October 2018 and then in June, September and early October of this year. Among those who saw trouble building were regulators at the California Public Utilities Commission. The first shutoff was chaotic and the next three were not going according to the guidelines regulators had passed. Commission staff met more frequently with PG&E starting in the spring, using advice and persuasion rather than mandating changes. \u201cWe, as the state, never got to the point where we had complete confidence in PG&E\u2019s ability to execute,\u201d said Elizaveta Malashenko, the top California regulator overseeing blackouts. Malashenko, deputy executive director of safety and enforcement policy, told the AP that the commission didn\u2019t act more aggressively because it has to balance punitive intervention with giving utilities a chance to self-correct. \u201cThere needs to be some basic operational assumption that you can set up a conference call,\u201d Malashenko said. Some critics faulted regulators for not doing enough. The utilities commission, a sprawling bureaucracy with a complex rule-making process, was \u201cnot aggressive enough early in setting clear requirements and standards,\u201d said Melissa Kasnitz, legal director for the Center for Accessible Technology, which advocates for people with disabilities. PG&E promised to fix a range of problems promptly, and an executive said it worked hard to deliver. In many ways, that didn\u2019t happen. Not only did the problems continue throughout the smaller shutoffs, but they were replicated on a huge scale starting with the mid-October shutoffs. The problems galled local officials, who vented deep frustration that a utility they often work closely with kept failing them. After all, they are the ones dealing with a shutoff\u2019s consequences. They must dispatch ambulances, run jails and water plants, direct traffic through darkened intersections, set up community shelters and much more. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if it\u2019s intentional disregard of all the warnings we gave them,\u201d said Napa County Supervisor Diane Dillon, whose district north of San Francisco has experienced nearly every shutoff. ___ Sixteen million people \u2014 more than the population of nearly any U.S. state \u2014 depend on PG&E for power. The shutoffs were an inconvenience for some and extremely costly for others. For society\u2019s most frail, they brought questions of life and death. Those who rely on medical devices in their homes were particularly vulnerable. \u201cPG&E did nothing to help us who depend on electricity to run our life support,\u201d recounted Grace Lin, a polio survivor who needs a ventilator to breathe and uses an electric wheelchair. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we could simply grind our teeth and tough it out by holding our breath.\u201d   Lin said she was confused by the notifications PG&E sent ahead of the first shutoff that affected her San Francisco Bay Area home on Oct. 9. The company website they referred to for updates was frozen. Lin considered herself lucky that she had the means to evacuate 20 miles away, to a quadriplegic friend\u2019s house that had electricity. PG&E could identify \u201cmedical baseline\u201d customers such as Lin based on billing records. Local officials working to identify everyone who might need help repeatedly asked PG&E to share its list, so no one was overlooked. Regulators said PG&E promised it would release medical baseline addresses during a shutoff. Yet when each of the first four hit, PG&E insisted that locals sign a legal agreement not to disclose the addresses, causing delay and uncertainty that regulators said could risk lives. On the eve of the first massive power outage, Malashenko of the utilities commission was urgently emailing company officials in frustration. \u201cThis issue has been discussed many times over the last several months\u201d yet \u201chas once again become an issue with PG&E,\u201d she wrote on Oct. 8. Malashenko said state officials also pushed PG&E to improve in other areas. Starting in April, they met at least weekly with PG&E, pointing out needed improvements and stressing that aspects of the utility\u2019s preparation was inadequate. PG&E argued that the commission\u2019s own privacy rules meant it couldn\u2019t share the addresses without a non-disclosure agreement, spokesman Jeff Smith explained. Resolving the problem took an order that the commission\u2019s executive director sent three hours before the first massive blackouts began. Other groups of vulnerable Californians endured shutoffs without the help they needed. \u201cA lot of them don\u2019t have support, a lot of them don\u2019t have family,\u201d Betty Briggs, 84, said of her elderly neighbors in the well-touristed Napa Valley town of Calistoga. \u201cIt makes it very difficult, and it puts them in danger.\u201d   Briggs can get around without help, but her husband requires 24-hour care due to dementia. He lives nearby at Cedars Care Home, where seven residents in their 80s and 90s experienced three shutoffs before mid-October. The outages created anxiety for people reliant on routine, as well as practical problems. Beds and wheelchair lifts require electricity. So does the heat and air conditioning. When the freezer got too warm, staff tossed 30 days of backup food. Owner Irais Lopez still hasn\u2019t restocked fully. \u201cNow, we only buy small quantities,\u201d Lopez said, \u201cbecause we don\u2019t know what will happen.\u201d  ___   At PG&E\u2019s high-rise headquarters in downtown San Francisco, the emergency operations center springs to life with each shutoff. Employees in different colored vests that distinguish their expertise cluster around banks of computer monitors showing real-time updates. Maps track wind speed and direction, as well as which circuits are down. Conversation hums in the background. This is where decisions are made and answers can be found \u2014 and local officials said they felt they had little access to either. Fed up with communication gaps, one hard-hit county requested a presence at PG&E headquarters during the September shutoff. Regulators required that the utility hold seats in its emergency operations center for local representatives, but a lawyer for Sonoma County instead spent her day in a conference room several locked doors away. \u201cThere was just a lack of understanding on behalf of PG&E of why local government needs timely information,\u201d said Petra Bruggisser, a deputy county counsel. PG&E already had a shaky reputation in its Northern and central California territory. The company spent three years in bankruptcy starting in 2001, after California\u2019s attempt to deregulate its power market went awry. Maintenance failures led to a natural gas pipeline blast near San Francisco in 2010 that killed eight people. PG&E was found criminally liable and paid a $1.6 billion fine. In late 2017, its equipment was suspected of starting the Tubbs Fire that killed 22 people and destroyed more than 5,600 buildings. The utility revealed in spring 2018 that it would start using power shutoffs when fire danger was high and extreme winds blew. PG&E then began to explain what to expect, sending millions of emails to update its customer contact files, running advertising in multiple languages and holding hundreds of meetings with community leaders, public safety agencies and residents. The California Public Utilities Commission started writing guidelines for how utilities should roll out \u201cde-energization.\u201d The guidelines were published as a 176-page document in June. By that point, PG&E had again filed for bankruptcy protection, crushed by liabilities for fires in 2017 and 2018, including the Camp Fire that nearly wiped out the town of Paradise and killed 85 people. The utility now has a market value of about $6 billion \u2014 a drop of $30 billion in just over two years \u2014 and is working with the state and a federal judge to emerge from bankruptcy by June 30. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said he expects PG&E\u2019s entire 14-member board of directors, including Johnson, its CEO, to step down before the state will approve the utility\u2019s plan to regain its financial footing. \u201cPG&E\u2019s recent management of the public safety power shutoffs did not restore public confidence,\u201d the Democratic governor warned the company in a Dec. 13 letter. \u201cInstead, PG&E caused extreme uncertainty and harm for Californians who rely on power for their health care and their livelihood.\u201d PG&E said Johnson was not available for an interview. The utility\u2019s point man on the shutoffs told AP that he believes Johnson, while testifying before lawmakers last month, was referring to its ability to kill and safely restore power to an extremely complex electrical grid. Sumeet Singh, a vice president who oversees PG&E\u2019s community wildfire safety program, listed a litany of ways the utility is investing in fixes that he said will lessen the need for future shutoffs. Those include trimming more vegetation near power lines and burying some lines in areas most at risk of igniting. Singh also acknowledged that the utility had some struggles during the early shutoffs but that it strove to improve and disputed any characterization that it did not succeed in some ways. He cited how quickly the utility restored power as one improvement, along with the timeliness and accuracy of customer notifications. \u201cDid we hit the mark on every single improvement? No. Do we have more work to do? Yes,\u201d Singh said. Power shutoffs are likely to be a feature of life in California for years to come. PG&E must invest billions in infrastructure upgrades, and communities are spreading into lands once populated by trees and brush. Regulators promise to be watching closely. \u201cIf we have an outcome that doesn\u2019t meet the public expectation and what we need to run as a state,\u201d said Malashenko of the utilities commission, \u201cthat means that we need to rethink our approach and try something different and drive to a better outcome.\u201d In November, the commission launched an investigation into whether it should sanction PG&E for violating shutoff protocols. PG&E said it will need to improve how it reacts after it shuts off the power. \u201cI think we thought the big event was turning off the power,\u201d Johnson told lawmakers. \u201cAnd I think we focused on that as the main event instead of the impact of that, right, on the people it affected.\u201d ___ Pritchard reported from Los Angeles.

It fell 2.2% from 2016 to 2017, according to the new American Cancer Society report. That\u2019s the largest drop ever seen in national cancer statistics going back to 1930, said Rebecca Siegel, the lead author. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely driven by lung cancer,\u201d which accounts for about a quarter of all cancer deaths, she said. Take lung cancer out of the mix, and the 2017 rate drop is 1.4%, she added. Government researchers previously reported a slightly lower drop in the cancer death rate for the same period. But the Cancer Society calculates the death rate differently, and on Wednesday said the decline was larger \u2014 and record-setting. Most lung cancer cases are tied to smoking, and decades of declining smoking rates led to falling rates of lung cancer illnesses and deaths. But the drop in deaths seems to have been accelerated by recent lung cancer treatment advances, Siegel said. Experts mainly credit advances in treatment. Topping the list are refinements in surgery, better diagnostic scanning, and more precise use of radiation. They also celebrate the impact of newer drugs. Genetic testing can now identify specific cancer cell mutations, which allow more targeted therapy using newer pharmaceuticals that are a step beyond traditional chemotherapy. \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting time,\u201d said Dr. Jyoti Patel, a Northwestern University lung cancer expert. Even patients with late-stage cancers are surviving for several years \u2014 rather than months \u2014 after treatment starts, she said. \u201cThat was very, very uncommon a decade ago,\u201d she said. New immunotherapy drugs could accelerate the death rate decline, Patel said. Cancer Society researchers also found: \u2014 The overall cancer death rate fell by nearly 30% from 1991 through 2017. \u2014 Death rates from one type of skin cancer dropped even more dramatically than lung cancer \u2014 falling 7% a year recently. That decline in melanoma patients is attributed to drugs that came on the market about nine years ago. \u2014 Declines in the death rates from prostate, breast and colon cancer are slowing, for a range of reasons. \u2014 The rising liver cancer death rate seems to have leveled off somewhat. That may be related to better treatment of hepatitis C infections, which are tied to about 25% of liver cancer cases, Siegel said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

Much of the criticisms from the former EPA heads focused on perceptions that the Trump administration was focusing on economic and financial interests, sidelining or rejecting science and minimizing environmental and health effects in moving to ease dozens of environmental regulations. Asked for reaction, EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said current EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler was working to engage the agency\u2019s Science Advisory Board, or SAB. \u201cAdministrator Wheeler will continue to work with the SAB and try to improve relations that the previous administration took for granted,\u201d Abboud said.

The story wrapped the new analysis into the context of prior work: \u201cWhile earlier research has yielded mixed conclusions on the link between cancer and fiber, it would make scientific sense: According to the Chinese researchers, people who eat high-fiber diets have lower levels of estrogen, which is a risk factor for breast tumors.

In January, the 23-year department veteran was spotted arriving late to mandatory in-service trainings and leaving early. He was placed on administrative leave in August pending the internal investigation. When asked about his training attendance, Hickey told investigators that he did leave at least one class early, but he didn\u2019t remember why. He also acknowledged having a second job at the mental health institute where he worked \u201calmost every day except for the weekend.\u201d He was pretty sure he took time off from that job for the training though, he told investigators.

The investigation found Hickey was actually working as a full-time social worker, clocking more than 37 hours at the institute during the week of police training. Hickey was fired from the mental health institute this summer after an internal investigation by the state Department of Mental Health found a previously undisclosed conflict of interest with Hickey\u2019s role at the police department.

Irish drugmaker Amarin is seeking approval for a much larger group of patients who have lower fat levels but are still at risk of heart problems, despite taking cholesterol-lowering statin drugs like Lipitor and Zocor. The panel of advisers to the Food and Drug Administration unanimously supported the expansion based on recent study results showing the drug can cut rates of life-threatening heart problems in high-risk patients. \u201cThere is no doubt this drug could benefit a substantial portion of the U.S. population and meet an unmet need,\u201d said Dr. Jack Yanovski, a panelist and hormone specialist from the federal National Institutes of Health. The FDA is not required to follow the group\u2019s advice and is expected to make its decision by the end of the year. Financial analysts predict that broader use could translate into billions in sales for Amarin. Vascepa costs around $300 a month. Some panelists urged the FDA to tailor the drug\u2019s label to patients who are most likely to benefit. \u201cI do not want to see this become what I call cardio candy,\u201d said Philip Posner, a patient representative on the panel. FDA-written drug labels guide physician prescribing and often determine which uses are paid for by insurers. Panelists based their decision on a company-funded study showing that Vascepa cut the risk of heart attack, clogged arteries and other cardiovascular problems by about 25%, compared with a dummy treatment. Patients in the study were randomly assigned to take Vascepa or mineral oil capsules as a comparison. Patients in the trial had high triglycerides and other risk factors for heart problems, such as diabetes. The results, published last year, came as a surprise because a string of past studies of fish oil failed to show a positive impact on heart health. The panel noted several potential side effects of the drug, including irregular heartbeats and internal bleeding. But they agreed the drug\u2019s benefits outweighed those risks, which could be monitored and managed by physicians. Millions of Americans take over-the-counter fish oil supplements for their presumed health benefits. These oils, also called omega-3 fatty acids, are known to reduce triglycerides. But several pharmaceutical trials have tried and failed to show that lowering those fats translates into meaningful benefits for patients. If approved, Vascepa would be the first fat-lowering drug endorsed by the FDA to reduce heart problems. Amarin has long tried to differentiate its drug from non-prescription fish oil supplements. Company advertising states that it can take 10 to 40 over-the-counter capsules to equal the daily dose of Vascepa. The drug is taken in four 1-gram capsules per day. Wall Street analysts have high expectations for broader use of the drug, with some projecting annual sales of $3 billion or higher. That compares to total company sales of just $228.4 million in 2018, according to Amarin\u2019s financial reports. Vascepa, first approved in 2012, is Amarin\u2019s only product on the U.S. market. ___ Follow Matthew Perrone on Twitter: @AP_FDAwriter ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

On Feb. 16, Wisconsin Republican official Anna Kelly posted a 60-second clip of Bloomberg to Twitter, writing: \u201cBillionaire Bloomberg claims he \u2018could teach anybody to be a farmer,\u2019 even implying that farmers don\u2019t have the same level of \u2018skill set\u2019 or \u2018grey matter\u2019 as folks in tech jobs.

He will never fight for them because he couldn\u2019t care less about them. https://t.co/03CmskF5Vn \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) February 17, 2020  The 60-second clip, and Bloomberg\u2019s remarks, garnered widespread coverage and prompted an angry response from some right-leaning observers. In an interview with Fox News, South Dakota\u2019s Republican Gov. Kristi Noem accused Bloomberg of exhibiting \u201cpompous ignorance\u201d in his comments. The video footage contained in Kelly\u2019s Twitter post, and subsequently shared widely online, was authentic and not doctored. Although clearly it was cut from a much longer video, its removal from its original context did not substantively alter its tone or sense, nor deprive the viewer of context which might significantly change or impinge upon their understanding of Bloomberg\u2019s remarks. As such, the claim that Bloomberg had said he could \u201cteach anybody to be a farmer\u201d and that information technology work required \u201cmore gray matter\u201d was accurate. The original video was recorded at the University of Oxford\u2019s Sa\u00efd Business School on Nov. 17, 2016. Bloomberg appeared there as part of the school\u2019s \u201cDistinguished Speaker Seminar Series.\u201d The full video can be viewed on YouTube, below. When he made his remarks about farming and technology, Bloomberg was responding to a question, placed by an audience member, about the role of business leaders in addressing or alleviating public perceptions of economic inequality, especially in the context of Trump\u2019s 2016 election victory, which had taken place only days earlier. The following is a complete transcript of that question, and Bloomberg\u2019s full response. The segment shown in the 60-second clip is in bold type: Ewen Hollingsworth: Ewen Hollingsworth, doing my MBA here. Mr. Bloomberg, Trump got in on a great sense of inequality, not just in the United States but across the world. There\u2019s been a divide, and there\u2019s an increasing divide, between the haves and the have-nots. What do you think business leaders \u2014 what\u2019s their responsibility to addressing that divide and uniting, perhaps, the central America [read: \u2018Middle America\u2019] and the coasts? Mike Bloomberg: Well, number one, I question whether you\u2019re right. We have, in the last four decades, cut poverty in half in the world, if you measure poverty by people who go to bed without a roof over their head, a meal in their stomach and [who] can\u2019t read. So society is making some progress. Life expectancy is going up, we\u2019re [inaudible] cure more diseases, and we\u2019re about to eradicate \u2014 thanks to [Bill] Gates and a little bit of money from us \u2014 eradicate polio. So we\u2019re doing some things to help. Number two, the bottom 20% is a lot better off than the bottom 20% in the past. The bottom 20% in America \u2014 the bottom 20% in New York City, 80% have cars, 30% have two cars, virtually everybody has a cellphone, they all have 72-inch TV screens and sort of thing. So there is some of this, so you\u2019ve got to be careful in this. And, incidentally, before we address the basic issue, if you measure poverty by the top 1% versus the bottom 20%, you get very different numbers than if you measure it by the two to 20% down from the top here, and the bottom 20%. Because of very low interest rates, you have inflated values of fixed assets, which are almost always owned by the very wealthy, and so, they\u2019ve shot up \u2014 maybe it\u2019s the top 5% \u2014 but if you adjusted for that, it\u2019s not as disparate as you would think. So that\u2019s what the real world is. We have a problem of income inequality, nevertheless. I would argue what\u2019s more important is we have educational inequality. There was a story on the front page of the FT [Financial Times] today, I think it was, that said there\u2019s nobody from the poor districts of London that comes to this great school, one of the great universities of the whole world, and zero from poor neighborhoods, at least I assume the statistics are right and they didn\u2019t just cherry-pick one neighborhood. So that is more important than net worth because that says what the future is going to be for the young people. Having said all of that, you can fix the inequality. You take money from the rich and you give it to the poor. We\u2019ve always done that, we have a tax system, generally, around the world, that is graduated at the top end, progressive tax system, takes more money from the rich per capita and redistributes it. Tuition in a university, in America certainly, is a Robin Hood plan. You want \u2014 the kids are always on the wrong side of that, they always want lower tuition, no you don\u2019t, you want to raise tuition in the university, as high as you can, so the wealthy will contribute more money, and then use the extra money to subsidize those kids who have no money. If you reduce the amount of money you take in from the rich, it\u2019s the poor that get hurt, not helped. So some of these things are a little bit counterintuitive. But you take the money from the rich, you give it to the poor, you do it for altruistic reasons, you do it because you don\u2019t want the poor on your doorstep and there are a variety of things. But I think what you\u2019ve got to understand is the people who are getting the subsidy want the dignity of a job. They want the dignity of being responsible for their family and being able to take care of it. And that\u2019s the conundrum we\u2019re going to have here because technology is reducing the ability to give them the jobs. We just \u2014 more and more, if you think about it, the agrarian society lasted 3,000 years, and we could teach processes. I could teach anybody \u2014 even people in this room, no offense intended \u2014 to be a farmer. It\u2019s a [process]. You dig a hole, you put a seed in, you put dirt on top, add water, up comes the corn. You could learn that. Then you have 300 years of the industrial society. You put the piece of metal on the lathe, you turn the crank in the direction of the arrow and you can have a job. And we created a lot of jobs. [At] one point, 98% of the world worked in agriculture, today it\u2019s 2%, in the United States. Now comes the information economy. And the information economy is fundamentally different because it\u2019s built around replacing people with technology, and the skill sets that you have to learn are how to think and analyze. And that is a whole degree level different. You have to have a different skill set, you have to have a lot more gray matter. It\u2019s not clear that teachers can teach or the students can learn. So the challenge for society is to find jobs for these people \u2014 who we can take care of giving them a roof over their head and a meal in their stomach, and a cellphone and a car and that sort of thing. But the thing that\u2019s the most important, that will stop them from setting up the guillotines some day, is the dignity of a job. And nobody\u2019s yet come up with a simple solution, in this day and age, to how we create jobs, particularly for people already out of school. I can tell you how to fix the school system so that the kids come out with better skills, more ability to appreciate life and to work collaboratively and collectively and read the instruction manual and follow orders. But it\u2019s very hard to figure out where the jobs they\u2019re going to get will come from, and for those that are already out in the work force, to get them back into the system and teach them new skill sets, is almost impossible. It\u2019s very very hard to do and nobody\u2019s really shown they could it. There\u2019s individual cases where you can retrain them, I don\u2019t want to overstate it. But the coal miner I talked about in West Virginia is not going to move, and his family, out to California where the solar jobs are, and even if he got there he\u2019s not going to get those jobs. Nobody\u2019s going to hire an older person. It\u2019s fascinating to me \u2014 older people are always willing to hire younger people; younger people are not willing to hire older people. I think it\u2019s just they\u2019re afraid of older people that may have skill sets they don\u2019t have, and you know, they make fun of them, they say they\u2019re not able to change and think \u2014 none of those things are true, there are plenty of older people who are really smart and really can do new things if you gave them the opportunity. But there\u2019s a discrimination from young managers to hire older people. It\u2019s reasonably well documented I think, and certainly observable. So your basic premise is, it\u2019s not that bad, it\u2019s better than it was before, but it\u2019s a big problem and the problem is not the redistribution of wealth, it is the job where you\u2019re going every day. And you say \u2018What\u2019s business\u2019s responsibility?\u2019 It\u2019s not business\u2019s job. Business\u2019s job is to take the investors\u2019 money and to maximize the money by creating products that the public wants and are willing to pay for. And you can\u2019t say to them they should go and create jobs deliberately. You can have a tax policy that encourages that, and that\u2019s one of the things you should do, and then use the collective wisdom of all of the heads of companies, to create small pockets, and it adds up to a lot of jobs. That\u2019s what I would do right away. Your taxes are lower the more people you hire, and higher the fewer people you hire. And let capitalism work, because government\u2019s not going to be able to solve the problem directly. But short of that, who\u2019s going to create the jobs? Well if it\u2019s not industry, there\u2019s only one group left to do it. And so the next time you want more efficient government, think twice. I\u2019m not so sure you do want more efficient government. Back in the \u201930s, we created an inefficient government. We put people to work building infrastructure we needed. They weren\u2019t maybe the \u2014 you could have had other people do it more efficiently but we wanted to create jobs and we did, and it took us \u2014 World War II was really what took us out of the Depression, but it got us through the Depression. And maybe that is the answer, that we\u2019re going to say \u2018government\u2019s got to create no-show jobs,\u2019 or jobs that you have to show but that aren\u2019t needed. We can pass a law that says you\u2019ve got to move all the paper from the left to the right side of the building every day, and back again. Okay. And then the government are going to hire people to do it. But it\u2019s better than people being out on the streets, desperate for a job, not being able to find it, [destabilizing] society.\u201d", "output": "\"In 2016 Mike Bloomberg said he \"\"could teach anybody to be a farmer\"\" but information technology required \"\"a lot more gray matter.\"", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "Preliminary results found the bacteria in the water supply at a prison medical facility in Stockton and at two neighboring youth correctional facilities, Corrections Department spokeswoman Vicky Waters said.

Missouri grants exemptions for religious and medical reasons. The hearing came just days after a judge temporarily blocked a suburban New York county\u2019s emergency order banning children from public places unless they\u2019ve been vaccinated against measles. Lawmakers from other states also are looking to ramp up vaccinations in response to outbreaks of diseases such as measles and whooping cough . Washington lawmakers in March passed a measure to strip exemptions for measles vaccinations after an outbreak sickened dozens. There\u2019s a push to end non-medical exemptions for vaccines in Maine, where there were 95 cases of whooping cough through February. While overall vaccination rates remain high in the U.S. according to the Centers for Disease Control, the number of kids under two who haven\u2019t received any vaccines is growing. The CDC attributes much of this to lack of health insurance \u2014 uninsured kids are much more likely to be unvaccinated than children who have health insurance. Janessa Baake, from the city of Peculiar in southwestern Missouri, cited concern over potential medical risks and told lawmakers Monday that her 3-year-old daughter is unvaccinated. She said after being denied by a Missouri doctor, she now takes her daughter to a Kansas pediatrician. Another man said his two children developed autism after being vaccinated as toddlers. \u201cAll of the stories and the anecdotes that we heard are very important, but I don\u2019t think that they can be used to refute science,\u201d Ferguson Democrat Rep. Cora Faith Walker said during a break in the hearing. Multiple studies have debunked claims that measles, mumps and rubella vaccinations increase the risk for autism, and the National Institutes of Health says reports of serious reactions are rare: about one every 100,000 vaccinations.

Pharmaceutical companies now pay rebates to insurers and pharmacy benefit managers to help their medications gain a bigger slice of the market. Insurers apply savings from rebates to keep premiums more manageable. Under Trump\u2019s proposal, seniors covered by Medicare\u2019s popular \u201cPart D\u201d prescription benefit would be able to share in the rebates for individual drugs that they purchase at the pharmacy. Trump\u2019s budget would also expand Medicare\u2019s \u201ccatastrophic\u201d drug benefit so that many seniors with very high costs would not face copayments. Seniors with high drug bills are currently still responsible for 5 percent of the cost of their medications. With some new drugs costing $100,000 a year or more, patient costs add up quickly. The White House proposal would put Trump in the middle of a tug-of-war between drug companies on one side and insurers and pharmacy benefit managers on the other, with billions of dollars at stake. Insurers and pharmacy benefit managers say the reason drug costs are so high is that drug companies are free to charge what the market will bear. The pharmaceutical industry says middlemen are the problem, because they keep rebates paid by drug makers instead of passing them on to patients. Insurers counter that rebates are passed on in the form of lower monthly premiums for everybody. The drug industry lobbying group, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, had no immediate reaction. The Trump administration\u2019s new proposals come on top of a long list of Medicare changes in the congressional budget deal. Medicare is the government\u2019s premier health insurance program, covering about 60 million seniors and disabled people. Lawmakers would shift a greater share of Medicare drug costs to the pharmaceutical industry. They also want to eliminate the drug coverage gap known as the \u201cdoughnut hole\u201d one year earlier than currently scheduled, in 2019 instead of 2020. \u201cOn the whole, I think this is a good bill for people with Medicare,\u201d said Joe Baker, president of the Medicare Rights Center, said of the congressional legislation. \u201cThis tilts toward getting a lot of good things done.\u201d But his group opposes a provision that would raise premiums paid by the wealthiest retirees for coverage of outpatient services and prescription drugs. Here\u2019s a look at some of the major Medicare provisions in the budget deal that Republican leaders are trying to push through Congress. Democrats are split over the overall measure, but the Medicare provisions appear to have support from both parties: \u2014 PRESCRIPTION DRUGS Originally, beneficiaries in the \u201cdoughnut hole\u201d coverage gap were responsible for the full cost of their medications, but the Affordable Care Act passed under former President Barack Obama gradually closes the gap. The budget deal accelerates the timetable by one year, to 2019. Drug makers are already required to provide discounts to close the coverage gap, but the budget deal raises the level of company discounts, which in turn lowers the government\u2019s costs. That should act as a brake on the monthly premiums paid by beneficiaries. \u201cIn theory when Medicare spending goes down, premiums would go down, too,\u201d said Tricia Neuman, a Medicare expert with the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. The drug industry is criticizing the proposal, saying it will mainly benefit insurance companies that act as middlemen providing the benefit. The coverage gap starts when beneficiaries hit $3,750 in total drug costs. \u2014 CAPS REPEALED ON REHAB The budget deal permanently repeals limits on therapy services commonly used by stroke patients and people recovering from major surgeries. Those services include physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy. In previous years, Congress had routinely held off on applying the caps. Groups including AARP were pressing for a full repeal. It takes effect this year. __HIGHER PREMIUMS FOR WEALTHIEST RETIREES Premiums for outpatient coverage and prescription drugs would rise for about 1 million wealthy seniors with annual incomes of at least $500,000 for an individual, or $750,000 for a couple filing jointly. Hiking premiums on the well-to-do is an idea that has bipartisan support among lawmakers, but advocates worry that Congress will ultimately start raising costs for middle-class seniors as well. __TELEMEDICINE AND CHRONIC CARE The budget deal expands Medicare\u2019s ability to pay for telemedicine in a wide variety of situations, including for patients with stroke symptoms. It also incorporates a bipartisan Senate bill that is intended to improve care coordination for patients with chronic illnesses, such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. \u2014COST CONTROL BOARD REPEALED The deal would repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board, a Medicare cost-control agency authorized under the Affordable Care Act.

Rick Scott scared the bejesus out of seniors with an online ad claiming that Medicare rate cuts would lead them to lose access to their doctors, hospitals and preventive care. Then, the Florida Democratic Party fired back at Scott, issuing a press release that called Scott \"\"the ultimate Medicare thief.\"\" The Democrats were referring to Scott\u2019s prior tenure as CEO of Columbia/HCA about a decade ago, when the hospital company was fined $1.7 billion for Medicare fraud. \"\"Rick Scott is saying Democrats are committing Medicare robbery, when in fact he's the ultimate Medicare thief. He lost the right to accuse Democrats of raiding Medicare when he oversaw the largest Medicare fraud in the nation's history. Rick Scott's company stole money that should have gone to health care for seniors,\"\" said Florida Democratic Party spokesman Joshua Karp in the Feb. 25 press release. Separately, we have fact-checked Scott\u2019s claim \"\"we are seeing dramatic rate cuts\"\" to Medicare that will affect people's choice of doctor, hospital and preventive care. We concluded that Scott had failed to say that the rate cut only applies to Medicare Advantage, and thus only affects a fraction of all Medicare beneficiaries. Also, it could be several months before we know the actual impact of the cut which could vary county by county. Here, we\u2019ll fact-check the Democratic counter-attack that Scott \"\"oversaw the largest Medicare fraud in the nation\u2019s history.\"\" Scott\u2019s tenure at Columbia/HCA During Scott\u2019s 2010 race for governor, PolitiFact fact-checked multiple claims related to his tenure at Columbia/HCA. Now, we\u2019ll recap some of our earlier discussion of the investigation and fine. Scott started what was first Columbia in 1987, purchasing two El Paso, Texas, hospitals. Over the next decade he would add hundreds of hospitals, surgery centers and home health locations. In 1994, Scott\u2019s Columbia purchased Tennessee-headquartered HCA and its 100 hospitals, and merged the companies. In 1997, federal agents went public with an investigation into the company, first seizing records from four El Paso-area hospitals and then expanding across the country. The investigation focused on whether Columbia/HCA had committed Medicare and Medicaid fraud. Scott resigned as CEO in July 1997, less than four months after the inquiry became public. Company executives said had Scott remained CEO, the entire chain could have been in jeopardy. During his 2010 race, the Miami Herald reported that Scott had said he would have immediately stopped his company from committing fraud -- if only \"\"somebody told me something was wrong.\"\" But there were such warnings in the company\u2019s annual public reports to stockholders -- which Scott had to sign as president and CEO. Scott wanted to fight the accusations, but the corporate board of the publicly traded company wanted to settle. In December 2000, the U.S. Justice Department announced that Columbia/HCA agreed to pay $840 million in criminal fines, civil damages and penalties. Among the revelations from the 2000 settlement: \u2022 Columbia billed Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal programs for tests that were not necessary or had not been ordered by physicians; \u2022 The company attached false diagnosis codes to patient records to increase reimbursement to the hospitals; \u2022 The company illegally claimed non-reimbursable marketing and advertising costs as community education; \u2022 Columbia billed the government for home health care visits for patients who did not qualify to receive them. The government settled a second series of similar claims with Columbia/HCA in 2002 for an additional $881 million. The total for the two fines was $1.7 billion. On Scott\u2019s 2010 campaign website, he admitted to the $1.7 billion fine, though the link is no longer on the site. What type of record was that fine? The fine clearly set a record, though the Justice Department (and media reports at the time) were not always consistent in their terminology, sometimes describing it as the \"\"largest government fraud settlement in U.S. History\"\" and other times more specifically as the \"\"largest health care fraud case in U.S. History.\"\" A Justice Department spokeswoman said that officials refer to Columbia/HCA as \"\"largest health care fraud\"\" rather than the more narrow term \"\"Medicare fraud\"\" because it involved defrauding other government programs such as Medicaid rather than Medicare exclusively. The Justice Department described in detail the various ways the company defrauded Medicare and other government health programs here. Here\u2019s a key point, though: While the Columbia/HCA settlement was a record at the time for health care fraud, it has since been surpassed. In cases related to the improper promotion of certain drugs, Johnson & Johnson agreed to a a $2.2 billion settlement in 2013, Pfizer settled for $2.3 billion in 2009, and GlaxoSmithKline settled for $3 billion in 2012. \"\"HCA was the record health care fraud at the time. It\u2019s now Glaxo,\"\" Justice Department spokeswoman Linda Mansour told PolitiFact in an email. That said, these cases were a little different. While the Justice Department\u2019s case against Columbia/HCA repeatedly mentions overbilling and defrauding Medicare and Medicaid specifically, the three newer cases focused on the marketing of drugs, with Medicare, Medicaid and other federal programs caught up in the impropriety, rather than being the specific targets of the fraud. Because the Justice Department press releases explaining the settlements don\u2019t explicitly break down how much of the misconduct in those more recent cases defrauded Medicare explicitly, it\u2019s difficult to make comparisons. The Pfizer case includes violations relating to misbranding and kickbacks, \"\"so there may be a distinction to be made for that reason when thinking about whether it all should be classified under the very general category of \u2018Medicare fraud,\u2019\u00a0\"\" said Asha Scielzo, who practices health care law at the firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman. The Columbia/HCA case \"\"still is the largest fraud settlement for a hospital corporation in U.S. history,\"\" since all the others involved pharmaceutical firms, added Zack Buck, a health care law professor at Mercer. \"\"So I guess, the quote (by the Florida Democratic Party) is a little loose.\"\" The Scott campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this fact-check. However in 2010, Scott told the Tampa Bay Times, \"\"There's no question that mistakes were made and as CEO, I have to accept responsibility for those mistakes. I was focused on lowering costs and making the hospitals more efficient. I could have had more internal and external controls. I learned hard lessons, and I've taken that lesson and it's helped me become a better business person and a better leader.\"\" Our ruling The Florida Democratic Party said Scott \"\"oversaw the largest Medicare fraud in the nation\u2019s history.\"\" The Columbia/HCA settlement has since been surpassed in dollar value, though the bigger cases involved Medicare somewhat less directly.

The FDA usually follows the advice of its advisory panels. The drug, which would be sold under the brand name Zontivity, is designed to prevent heart-related deaths, cardiac arrests and strokes in patients who have had a recent heart attack. It would not be recommended for patients who have previously had a stroke because of an increased risk of bleeding in the brain. Results from a trial known as TRA 2P \u201care sufficient to establish the effectiveness of vorapaxar for its proposed indication,\u201d the review found. The main safety concern with the drug is bleeding, the review found, though it noted that the rate of fatal bleeding was low in the population for whom the drug is proposed. The FDA did not recommend that the company establish a risk management program, nor did it recommend that the company conduct additional trials following approval. Vorapaxar works by preventing blood cells, known as platelets, from clumping together and forming clots in the arteries, which can lead to heart attacks.

Each year about 525,000 Americans have heart attacks and about 190,000 have a second heart-related event, according to Merck. Standard therapy to prevent a second episode often includes treatment with aspirin and Plavix. Voraxapar would be given in addition to standard treatment. During clinical trials, safety monitors found that patients who had previously had a stroke were at higher risk of bleeding in the brain and were instructed to stop taking the drug. Merck then focused its analysis on patients who had had a heart attack but no stroke.

Infections within the migrant community, however, are mounting. As of April 14, out of 3,252 cases recorded in Singapore, 1,625 were linked to outbreaks in migrant worker dormitories. Rights groups, charities and medical experts had flagged the potential for mass infection among the more than 300,000 migrant workers living in often cramped and unsanitary conditions in the wealthy country of 5.7 million. But some of Singapore\u2019s early policy responses did not account for this vulnerable community, according to rights groups and volunteer organisations. For example, a Singapore government order restricting doctors to single hospitals to prevent them spreading the virus sharply reduced volunteer health services depended upon by some workers, they\u00a0said. And a nationwide mask distribution at the start of the outbreak excluded migrant workers living in dormitories. Moreover, measures introduced recently to confine tens of thousands of workers to packed quarters may increase the risk of infection spread, they added. \u201cWe are definitely concerned that this approach exposes a lot more migrant workers to the risk of contracting COVID-19,\u201d said Rachel Chhoa-Howard, a Singapore researcher for the rights group Amnesty International. The authorities say they have taken preventative measures to address personal hygiene, inter-mingling and disease detection in migrant housing but that their decision to quarantine thousands of workers was necessary once the virus started spreading. Singapore\u2019s health and manpower ministries did not respond to specific questions for this article. Both referred Reuters to previous statements they had made on their virus containment measures. The situation in the migrant dormitories highlights the different standards applied to the mainly Bangladeshi and Indian manual workers whose labour has helped build the glitzy, modern city-state, and the rest of the population. The government has put up\u00a0Singapore residents\u00a0returning from overseas in expensive hotels to limit contagion. Some migrant workers have been confined to bunk rooms that they said had blocked toilets and overflowing refuse bins. The Ministry\u00a0of Manpower has said it faced \u201cchallenges\u201d at the start of the quarantine related to hygiene and the supply of food in the dormitories, but that it had been working with operators to improve conditions. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in an address on April 10 that Singapore appreciated the efforts of its migrant workers, and that they would continue to be paid while in quarantine. Some workers depended on getting healthcare at subsidised clinics run by a charity called HealthServe, staffed with volunteer doctors and nurses. But\u00a0when the government issued a directive\u00a0on Feb 7\u00a0saying that public hospital staff had to restrict their work to one hospital to prevent cross contamination, HealthServe said it had to scale back operations, depriving some of the most needy workers of medical care. HealthServe - which offers consultations for S$8 ($5.65), compared with around S$50 at government clinics - said it had to reduce services by 90% and close two of its three clinics. Jeremy Lim, chairman of the medical services committee at HealthServe, said he flagged the drop in volunteers to the government but was told nothing could be done. The Ministry of Health did not respond to a request for comment on the closure of the clinics. Lim said access to cheap healthcare could have made it easier to spot infections among migrant workers at an earlier stage. Migrant workers living in dormitories - often 12 or 20 to a room - were also excluded from a government initiative in February to distribute masks to every household after retailers ran out of stocks. Lim called this a \u201cblind spot\u201d in the policy response to migrants which \u201cwe are now learning to our collective regret\u201d. Singapore has now ordered residents to wear masks in public due to rising evidence of asymptomatic transmission. Deborah Fordyce, president of Transient Workers Count Too, an advocacy group, on March 23 warned in an editorial in the Straits Times, the country\u2019s main newspaper, that the risk of an outbreak within the migrant community was \u201cundeniable\u201d. Two weeks later, Singapore announced it was sealing off some 20,000 migrant workers in two dormitories. Eight dormitories are now under lockdown, impacting about 62,500 workers, according to Reuters estimates based on government statements and public information about the dormitories under lockdown. The Ministry of Manpower did not respond to a request for comment on the total number of people quarantined. The government has now ordered the rest of the country to stay home and maintain at least a metre distance from others if out for essential needs like food shopping. Singapore has also ramped up testing in dormitories and started to move some workers deemed \u201cessential\u201d into public housing, military camps and industrial accommodation ships, which authorities say is helping create more room in the complexes. The government has defended its virus-prevention measures in dormitories, which include advising operators to monitor workers for fever and preventing mingling in common areas. \u201cIt is not as if we have not done anything to try and manage the situation,\u201d Josephine Teo, the manpower minister, said\u00a0on April 9. Reuters spoke to six workers at four dormitories who said, on condition of anonymity, that precautions such as temperature checks and social distancing were not strictly enforced or only introduced very recently. The potential exposure of Singapore\u2019s migrant workers to infectious diseases was a concern of health experts\u00a0before the coronavirus outbreak. A review of previous disease outbreaks in Singapore such as malaria, dengue, zika and tuberculosis showed migrant workers were disproportionately affected, in part due to their living and working conditions, according to a study by Singapore scholars published in the Journal of Travel Medicine in 2017. Nilim Baruah, senior migration specialist at the International Labour Organisation, said migrant workers were among the groups most vulnerable to the COVID-19 outbreak. In Singapore, he said, \u201cliving conditions for many migrant workers do not favour social distancing\u201d. Majidul Haq, a 25-year-old Bangladeshi worker, stays at one packed quarantined dormitory where authorities say over 700 people have tested positive. \u201cIt is difficult to not think about the probability of getting the virus,\u201d he said.", "output": "In Singapore, migrant coronavirus cases highlight containment weak link.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "On 5 December 2018, the Seattle Times published an article whose terrifying headline ensured its own virality: \u201cRare brain-eating amoebas killed Seattle woman who rinsed her sinuses with tap water. Doctor warns this could happen again.\u201d Sadly for those who visited this page hoping to find that the reporting was exaggerated or made-up, this really happened. Though her anonymity was maintained, the story of a 69-year-old Seattle woman who used tap water in her Neti pot for over a year and then died from a Balamuthia mandrillaris brain infection was documented in a 20 September 2018 case study published in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases: We report the case of a 69-year-old female who presented with a chronic nasal skin rash, new onset focal seizure, and a cerebral ring-enhancing lesion after a year of improper nasal irrigation. Despite aggressive and novel anti-amoebic treatment, she died as a result of a Balamuthia mandrillaris brain infection. One year before developing the brain infection, the authors reported, the woman developed a chronic sinus infection whose symptoms were not relieved by medication. She turned to using a Neti pot to rinse her sinuses, but instead of using sterile or saline water as directed, she used tap water filtered with a Brita system. After a month of this practice, and without any relief of her sinus symptoms, \u201cshe developed a quarter-sized, red raised rash on the right side of the bridge of her nose and raw red skin at the nasal opening.\u201d Though several misdiagnoses followed, no doctor correctly recognized the rash as a symptom of an amoebic infection. The report stated that a year after that initial rash developed, the woman developed a seizure that required hospitalization. At that time, the doctors identified a lesion on the right side of the brain which they decided to biopsy. Some 19 days later, after a continued decline in the patient\u2019s health, scientists from Johns Hopkins University suggested the possibility that the cause of her malady was an amoebic infection, and the Centers for Disease Control rushed a novel drug for her treatment. Unfortunately, they were unable to halt the progression of the disease, and the patient\u2019s family made the decision to remove her from life support. An autopsy determined the cause of death to be Granulomatous Amebic Encephalitis (GAE), which the CDC defines as \u201ca serious infection of the brain and spinal cord that typically occurs in persons with a compromised immune system.\u201d In this case, the causative agent was an extremely rare amoeba named Balamuthia mandrillaris, one of three forms of amoeba known to be capable of infecting and consuming the human brain. Amoebas are a broad group of taxonomically mixed unicellular organisms that consume surrounding cellular material through absorption, and that express an ability to take on a variety of shapes. Several different species are associated with disease, most notably Naegleria fowleri, commonly known as the \u201cbrain-eating amoeba\u201d that can cause a different kind of brain infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). Balamuthia mandrillaris was discovered in 1986 in the brain of a mandrill monkey during an autopsy at the San Diego Zoo and is now recognized to be a cause of GAE in both humans, several primates, and other animals, with an estimated 200 cases of human infection ever documented. The amoebae are ubiquitous in soil and groundwater although their presence is not expected in city-treated water, according to Liz Coleman, a spokeswoman for the Environmental Public Health division of Washington State\u2019s Department of Health, quoted in the Seattle Times\u2019 reporting. Merely ingesting the thing will not lead to health problems, but in rare cases (usually instances involving people with weakened immune systems, or those who are young or old), the organisms can infect a host through skin breakage or via the respiratory system. If they infect the central nervous system, they \u201cingest bits and pieces of host tissue [and produce] enzymes that degrade the tissue.\u201d Nasal irrigation involves rinsing one\u2019s sinus cavity with distilled or sterile water (or water that has been filtered to remove potentially infectious organisms), and one such method of water delivery is a Neti pot. The need for sterility is explicitly stated due to the (extremely small) risk posed by another amoeba, Naegleria fowleri, and it is the reason the FDA requires (in the absence of sterile water) a specific kind of filter capable of removing the amoeba and similarly-sized organisms from water before it is pushed through fragile sinus tissue. While the authors of this case report could not state with absolute certainty that the Neti pot was to blame, it is far and away the most likely explanation given the fact that the patient had been rinsing her sinuses with tap water regularly for an extended period of time: While it is recommended that only sterile water or saline be used \u2026 the patient used tap water that was filtered with a Brita Water Purifier \u2026 Improper nasal irrigation has been reported as a method of infection for the comparably insidious amoeba, N. fowleri. This precedent led us to suspect the same route of entry for the Balamuthia amoeba in our case. Although this hypothesis is consistent with the patient\u2019s history and ultimate diagnosis, the water supply to the patient\u2019s home was not tested, hence our ability to definitively trace the patient\u2019s infection to improper nasal lavage is limited. Other routes of exposure are possible, according to a 2013 review of amoebic infections: Epidemiology of Balamuthia GAE is not well understood. However, based on several case reports it can be hypothesized that gardening, playing with dirt, or exposure to dust while motorcycling may play significant roles in the acquisition of Balamuthia infection. It has been shown that Balamuthia is found in the soil and dust in air and the route of infection is probably via inhalation of Balamuthia either present in soil or carried by the wind or the amebae entering the body through a cut or puncture. Once it gains entry into the body it is likely to spread hematogenously to the brain. Additionally, there is some indication that water may serve as a vehicle for acquiring the infection. Although the water used in the Neti pot likely caused this infection, Dr. Cynthia Maree, a co-author of the report and a member of the team that treated the woman in question, told the Seattle Times that \u201cthe risk of infection to the brain is extremely low,\u201d adding that \u201cpeople who use neti pots or other nasal-irrigation devices can nearly eliminate [that risk] by following directions printed on the devices, including using only saline or sterilized water.\u201d", "output": "A woman who rinsed her nasal passages using a neti pot filled with tap water contracted a fatal \u201cbrain-eating\u201d amoeba infection.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "The child\u2019s death is not related to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, the county Health Department said in a statement Wednesday.

One in 10 patients also said they avoided thinking about their cancer and one in 20 said they steered clear of situations or activities that reminded them of the disease, a situation that could potentially become a medical problem. \u201cYou worry if the patient is avoiding medical care, you worry they might not be getting follow-ups,\u201d Smith told Reuters Health. \u201cWe don\u2019t have data to support that, but we worry about it.\u201d   The study, published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, is based on a survey of 566 patients with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, a relatively common kind of cancer.

The diagnosis involved a trio of symptoms, including avoidance, arousal and flashbacks. Many more had one or more PTSD symptoms, however. The newest survey also showed they often persist.

During that month, social media users widely shared a 2015 article published on the Filipino website TheAsianParent, with the headline \u201c22-Year-Old Woman May Have Contracted HIV During a Manicure.\u201d The article reported that: According to New York Daily News, a 22-year-old Brazilian woman was diagnosed with HIV after getting a manicure using shared equipment. Doctors say the case, which was first reported in the journal AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses last year, highlights a \u201cnew form of transmission for the virus.\u201d She had none of the usual risk factors\u2026The journal article says that when the woman was first diagnosed, she was found to have advanced HIV. However, she didn\u2019t have any of the normal risk factors associated with contracting the virus, such as having sex without a condom, or sharing infected needles. When medical professionals probed further, they discovered that the woman had shared \u201cmanicure instruments years before with a cousin who was later found to be HIV-positive.\u201d Blood analysis also suggested that the woman had first got the virus around 10 years ago. The article was originally published on TheAsianParent\u2019s sister website in Singapore, on Nov. 2, 2015. The case attracted widespread media attention in 2014, including articles by Fox News and the New York Daily News. It\u2019s not clear why it began to trend once again online in October 2019. The report is based on a November 2014 paper entitled \u201cAn HIV-1 Transmission Case Possibly Associated With Manicure Care,\u201d which was published in the journal Aids Research and Human Retroviruses. That paper can be read in full here. It was written by researchers from the Santo Andr\u00e9 Aids Program, the Adolfo Lutz Institute, and the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, all located in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. As the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) explains, HIV is typically transmitted through the exchange of certain bodily fluids during sexual contact or sharing syringes. Other modes of transmission exist, but they are less common. It is rare for HIV to be contracted through inanimate objects (an inanimate object that transmits an infectious disease is known as a \u201cfomite\u201d). However, the CDC notes: \u201cIt\u2019s possible to get HIV from tattooing or body piercing if the equipment used for these procedures has someone else\u2019s blood in it or if the ink is shared. The risk of getting HIV this way is very low \u2026\u201d The 2014 paper described a case involving a Brazilian woman suspected of having contracted HIV a decade earlier, when she was 12 years old, by using cuticle scissors and other manicure implements that had also been used by her cousin, a manicurist. The researchers came to the conclusion that this was probably (though not certainly) the way in which she contracted the disease, after performing what\u2019s known as phylogenetic analysis of each woman\u2019s strain of HIV. The following is a good explanation of how phylogenetic analysis works, from Harvard University\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health: \u201cWhen a person becomes infected with HIV, their virus is similar to the virus of the person who infected them. Because HIV mutates quickly, each infected person\u2019s virus evolves differently over time \u2026 HIV phylogenetics is the study of the evolutionary history and relationships among transmitted viruses. A phylogenetic tree is an illustration of those relationships and HIV transmission dynamics.\u201d After conducting phylogenetic analysis, the S\u00e3o Paulo researchers were able to conclude that the 22-year-old woman probably contracted HIV from her older cousin about 10.81 years earlier. At that time, the older woman knew she had HIV, but her family did not, and she had stopped taking zidovudine and lamivudine, a combination of antiretroviral drugs that can lower the risk of transmitting HIV. The woman at the center of the case denied any sexual abuse by a third party (an account corroborated by her family), and based on interviews with both women, the only remaining plausible method of transmission was their shared use of manicure implements while the younger woman was around 12 years old. The researchers summarized their findings as follows: A recently diagnosed 22-year-old female with no history of transmission risk factors prompted a thorough investigation of possible alternative risk factors. As the patient had evidence of advanced disease and laboratory data compatible with long-standing infection, past events were reviewed. About 10 years ago the patient shared manicure utensils with an older cousin, later known to be HIV infected; this prompted the phylogenetic analysis of the HIV sequences of both patients. Phylogenetic analyses of partial HIV-1 polymerase and envelope sequences from both patients revealed highly related sequences, with an estimated common ancestor date (about 11 years ago) that coincided with the putative sharing of manicure instruments, during a time in which the cousin was not virally suppressed. Taken together, the information about the infection of this patient suggests the use of shared manicure instruments as an alternative route of fomite HIV-1 transmission. Although the woman and her cousin shared manicure implements, the woman did not exactly contract HIV \u201cduring a manicure,\u201d a description used by TheAsianParent that has engendered a degree of fear or concern, among some social media users, about visiting nail salons. Those fears appear to be largely unwarranted. The Brazilian case was scientifically notable precisely because it appears to be the first ever documented case of HIV transmission via manicure implements, and the already very low risk of transmission will diminish even further if members of the public visit properly licensed nail salons whose staff thoroughly sanitize all implements. Although TheAsianParent rightly stated that the woman \u201cmay have\u201d contracted HIV from the manicure implements, reflecting the probability (rather than certainty) asserted by the researchers, other websites omitted that nuance in their headlines, with Fox News, for example, writing \u201cWoman Contracts HIV Through Shared Manicure Equipment.\u201d", "output": "A woman in Brazil contracted HIV during a manicure.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "UCB shares dropped as much as 18.4 percent to 21.60 euros,  their lowest level since August 2003, as investors took a dim  view of the latest in a series of setbacks to hit the group.

Sink studied the effects of taking multiple anticholinergic  drugs on walking speed, basic activities such as dressing,  eating, taking care of personal hygiene, grooming, and harder  activities like shopping, cooking and managing money on her  test subjects whose average age was 78. The researchers found that the more anticholinergic drugs  people had in their systems, the worse their physical function,  based on reports from people in the study and on independent  measures of their performance. In a separate study this month in the Journal of the  American Geriatrics Society, Sink found that older nursing home  residents who took drugs for dementia and incontinence at the  same time had a 50 percent faster decline in function than  those treated only for dementia. \u201cI would encourage patients to bring in a list of  everything they take (even over-the-counter medications) to  their doctor and have them review it at least yearly,\u201d Sink  said. \u201cPhysicians should try to decrease anticholinergic burden  whenever possible.\u201d", "output": "Common drugs hasten decline in elderly: study.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "Washington State Secretary of Health John Wiesman approved the county\u2019s application Friday, making it the ninth county in the state to receive approval to move into phase two of the four-phase reopening process.

And they\u2019ll do that, and they\u2019re doing a very good job of it.\u201d  When asked by a reporter at the briefing why the increased production of masks was not reaching hospitals, Trump said the medical system was \u201cobsolete\u201d and the production system \u201cwasn\u2019t meant for this\u201d emergency. \u201cNobody knew there\u2019d be a pandemic or an epidemic of this proportion,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNobody has ever seen anything like this before.\u201d  Vice President Mike Pence said at the same briefing, \u201cWe\u2019ve vastly increased the supply of medical masks, and we\u2019re going to continue to put a priority on making sure that we\u2019re calling on industry at every level.\u201d  Meanwhile, many hospitals in other states have issued emergency calls for private companies to donate face masks and other items that can be used as medical protective gear. The Illinois Health and Hospital Association on Thursday, made that plea to help the state\u2019s 200 hospitals, asking for donations of masks from construction companies, dentists, veterinarians and any other group that might have the masks, called N95s. \u201cHospitals all over the state are in jeopardy of potentially running out of critically needed protective medical supplies,\u201d said the associations president and chief executive officer A.J.

In their global Tobacco Atlas, the WLF and the American Cancer Society said that in 2013, the last year for which detailed figures were available, tobacco industry profits were more than $44 billion. Meanwhile, 6.3 million people died from smoking-related illness, equivalent to a profit of $7,000 for each death caused by tobacco. The report said that, if current trends continue, a billion people will die from smoking and exposure to tobacco this century. Besides causing lung cancer, which is often fatal, tobacco use is also a major risk factor for a range of other illnesses. It is the world\u2019s leading preventable cause of premature death from chronic conditions such as heart disease, strokes and high blood pressure. In China, the world\u2019s most populous country, almost 2,250 cigarettes were smoked per person over age 15 last year, making it one of only around a dozen countries topping 2,000. The average Chinese smoker consumes 50 percent more than in 1980, a symptom of a broader phenomenon, as tobacco use declines or is stable in many wealthy, developed nations but growing in poorer regions such as Africa and parts of Asia. \u201cThe significant reductions in smoking rates in the United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, and other countries that implement increasingly tight tobacco control laws have been offset by the growing consumption in a single nation: China,\u201d the report said. Many countries around the world have introduced some anti-tobacco laws, including curbing advertising and banning smoking in enclosed spaces such as bars, restaurants and offices. But the Tobacco Atlas found that only 10 percent of the world\u2019s population are covered by comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship, and only 16 percent by comprehensive smoke-free legislation. Low- and middle-income countries now account for more than  80 percent of tobacco users and tobacco-related deaths. The Tobacco Atlas also found that smoking among women is also on the rise, driving up rates of female lung cancer. In an indication of future trends, there are 24 countries where girls smoke more than boys, compared to just two countries where more women smoke than men, it said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s the link between tobacco and increasing rates of lung cancer among women or the ever-increasing number of health conditions and deaths related to tobacco use, the health and economic case for reducing tobacco use has never been clearer,\u201d said John Seffrin, chief executive of the ACS.", "output": "Industry makes $7,000 for each tobacco death: health campaigners.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "Scientists who study the algae say the microscopic organisms are thriving in new conditions brought about by climate change, and displacing the zooplankton that underpin the local food chain, threatening the entire marine ecosystem. Khalid al-Hashmi, a marine biologist at the Sultan Qaboos University in Oman, wrinkles his nose as the research vessel nears the bloom. \u201cSea stench,\u201d he says, referring to the algae\u2019s ammonia secretions. \u201cIt\u2019s here, you can smell it.\u201d He signals the boat to stop as it speeds beneath a gigantic rock arch off the coast of Muscat, the capital of Oman, an arid sultanate on the southeastern corner of the Arabian Peninsula. The captain kills the engine and drops anchor into a slick of bright green muck surrounded by crystal-clear blue water. The swarms of microscopic creatures beneath the surface of the Gulf of Oman were all but invisible 30 years ago \u2014 now they form giant, murky shapes that can be seen from satellites. Across the planet, blooms have wrecked local ecosystems. Algae can paralyze fish, clog their gills, and absorb enough oxygen to suffocate them. Whales, turtles, dolphins and manatees have died, poisoned by algal toxins, in the Atlantic and Pacific. These toxins have infiltrated whole marine food chains and have, in rare cases, killed people, according to the U.N. science agency. In the Great Lakes of North America, Thailand and the Seychelles, the algae bloom green. In Florida they are red, in the North Atlantic they are chalky white, and in Puget Sound they are orange. The Irish call it the \u201csea ghost,\u201d and the Taiwanese refer to the blooms as \u201cblue tears.\u201d NASA uses satellites and floating robots to monitor the blooms, said Paula Bontempi, the manager for ocean carbon and biology projects at the U.S. space agency. \u201cIt\u2019s like a Van Gogh painting,\u201d she said, referring to satellite images of swirls of chlorophyll spiraling across the world\u2019s oceans. \u201cAbsolutely beautiful.\u201d It\u2019s less attractive up close, where it can be \u201calmost guacamole-like\u201d in some lakes. \u201cIt smells bad, it looks bad,\u201d she said. The satellite technology has enabled scientists to link the algae to higher levels of air and water pollution in recent decades, but Bontempi said questions remain. \u201cWe know that our Earth is changing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt may be in a direction we might not like.\u201d Scientists based at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University trace Oman\u2019s blooms to melting ice in the Himalayas. Less ice has raised temperatures in South Asia and strengthened the Indian Ocean\u2019s southwest monsoon. As this weather front moves across the Arabian Sea every year, it churned up oxygen-poor water thick with nutrients that have fueled the rise of a 1.2-billion-year old algae called noctiluca scintillans. For the past 15 years, observatory biogeochemist Joaquim Goes, al-Hashmi and biological oceanographer Helga do Rosario Gomes have tracked blooms in the Arabian Sea using boats, satellites and remote sensors. Goes said the blooms have caused a \u201cshort-circuiting of the food chain,\u201d endangering other marine life. \u201cNormally these things happen slowly, usually we talk about tens of hundreds of years. Here it\u2019s happening overnight,\u201d he said. \u201cThe transformation is happening before our eyes.\u201d The algae blooms pose a number of threats to Oman, whose fishing and trading ships have plied these waters for centuries. Thick blooms reduce visibility, making it difficult for divers to repair undersea gas infrastructure. It can also clog the intake pipes of the desalinization plants that produce up to 90 percent of the country\u2019s fresh water. Fishermen call Oman\u2019s marine research center when they spot blooms. Marine ecologist Ahmad al-Alawi adds these reports to four decades of observations before comparing them with satellite images of the swirling chlorophyll. He says the blooms are growing bigger and lasting longer, displacing the zooplankton at the bottom of the local food chain. The algae has attracted more whale sharks \u2014 a major draw for divers \u2014 but many tourists have cancelled their trips at the sight of the green, murky waves, said Ollie Clarke, a dive instructor at the Bandar al-Rowdah marina near Muscat. It also poses a threat to the country\u2019s fisheries. An outbreak of a different kind of algae in 2008 led to the beaching of 50 tons of oxygen-starved fish, which rotted up and down the coast, al-Alawi said. The researchers have found cause for both despair and hope by studying a live noctiluca culture in their lab: The blooms will likely spread as the Indian Ocean continues to absorb greenhouse gas emissions, but could be contained if they are sprayed with fresh water. Goes and Gomes hope to develop an early-warning system for Oman modeled on one operated by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Florida But Saleh al-Mashari, who learned to sail and fish as a boy in the small coastal village where he still lives, and who now captains a researcher vessel, said the damage is already done. \u201cThe fish are migrating,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can\u2019t get enough air here.\u201d", "output": "Growing algae bloom in Arabian Sea tied to climate change.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "The Casper Star-Tribune reported Monday (http://bit.ly/2oUz0aa ) that a press release by the Wyoming Health Department said while the rates for other sexual transmitted diseases such as chlamydia and syphilis have risen, gonorrhea has affected young people the most.

As a class, beta blockers drugs are low cost ($10 to $200 a month according to some estimates). The article describes the median survival time afforded the women with ovarian cancer under different scenarios \u2013 with or without beta blockers in addition to their chemotherapy. For example, women who had been taking any beta blocker at the time of their chemotherapy had a median survival of 47.8 months while women who were not being treated with beta blockers while on chemo had median survival time of 42 months. The article notes that the quoted source and the study authors cautioned that beta blockers carry some side effects and additional research is needed to determine if the drugs\u2019 benefits outweigh their risks for cancer patients. It specifically mentions risks for people with asthma. Other specific harms from beta-blockers for the general population include depression and diarrhea. Beta-blockers may also cause complications for people with diabetes. The article provides a good overall description of the size of the study and how patients were followed. It describes the median survival time afforded the 1,425 women with ovarian cancer under different scenarios \u2013 with or without beta blockers in addition to their chemotherapy. The use of language is appropriate in that it says these drugs were \u201clinked to\u201d and \u201cassociated with\u201d benefits, but never claims that the drugs \u201cprolonged survival\u201d as stated in the MD Anderson news release. The story also briefly touched on the study limitations. Because the research was a retrospective look at 1,425 cases in a database of ovarian cancer cases, it wasn\u2019t randomized. The article also notes that more research is needed to determine if the findings will translate into new treatments, and that \u201cThis is not something that people should rush out and start taking.\u201d One area of concern is that the subheadline touts the dramatic benefits seen in a subgroup of patients taking nonselective beta-blockers \u2014 \u201cA type of beta blocker is tied to more than four-year increase in survival for women with ovarian cancer, study finds\u201d \u2014 but the story never specifically cautions readers about the small size of this group (only 75 people). Findings from such a small subgroup should be treated very carefully, and we\u2019re not sure that they should have been highlighted for readers in the headline. We say this knowing full well that reporters often have no control over what gets put in the headline. We observed no evidence of fear-mongering language in the story. The story includes an independent source who wasn\u2019t affiliated with the research. Christina Annunziata, a director with the Center for Cancer Research at the National Institutes of Health, said that while she found the study \u201cinteresting\u201d and \u201cthought-provoking,\u201d she cautioned that \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s practice-changing quite yet.\u201d Annunziata co-authored an editorial accompanying the report which were both published in the American Cancer Society\u2019s Cancer journal. The story would have been even stronger had it outlined the funding sources for this study, which included government and foundation grants. However, since we didn\u2019t find any significant conflicts in the list of funding sources, we didn\u2019t think this omission unbalanced the coverage. The relevant research is based on evaluating the use of beta blockers in conjunction with conventional chemotherapy, not as an alternative to chemotherapy or other courses of treatment. As such, we\u2019ll rate \u201cCompare Alternatives\u201d as Not Applicable. Beta blockers are called \u201ccommon heart drugs\u201d in the story and are thus generally understood to be widely available. Beta-blockers first came on the market more than 50 years ago and their use has become widespread as researchers found more applications for this class of drugs. Generic versions are available, making them some of the most affordable prescription drugs. A close call here. The story acknowledges previous research in this areas when it says, \u201cMouse and test-tube studies have shown that so-called nonselective beta blockers inhibit molecular pathways that promote tumor growth. Selective versions, designed to minimize side effects for heart patients, are less effective in hitting such targets. Dr. Sood and his colleagues wondered if the same effect would be found in people.\u201d\u00a0That\u2019s good context, but the story could also have noted that a number of studies\u00a0have indeed examined the impact of beta-blocker use on ovarian cancer patients, and did not find the same prolonged survival rates that are reported on in this story. The researchers think that\u2019s because these earlier studies didn\u2019t distinguish between the two types of beta-blockers.

Furthermore, the story thoroughly details the risks that come with an overactive or an underactive thyroid gland for the average person. The article mentions that, for mild cases of hypothyroidism, scientists are unsure whether diagnoses and subsequent treatment sufficiently help pregnant patients or, instead, waste money on blood testing and thyroid medication. This is appropriately stated high up (in the first third) in the report.

But could mirth also be deadly, making the phrase \u201cI just about died laughing\u201d as much about accuracy as it is hyperbole? On 24 March 1975, 50-year-old bricklayer Alex Mitchell of King\u2019s Lynn in Norfolk, England, kicked the bucket while roaring with laughter at one of his favorite television shows, the comedy program The Goodies. The skit that precipitated Mitchell\u2019s fatal fit of glee involved a kilted Scotsman\u2019s flailing away with his bagpipe at a vicious black pudding intent upon attacking him. Mitchell was unable to stop laughing, and after twenty-five minutes of uproar gave one last \u201ctremendous belly laugh, slumped on the settee, and died,\u201d said his widow, who witnessed his passing. While Mitchell had expired from heart failure, what felled him was not a classic heart attack, but rather the result of an unusual inheritable heart rhythm disorder that routinely takes the lives of even apparently robust 20-somethings. Mitchell had Long QT syndrome, an affliction in which the heart is prone to experiencing long pauses between heart beats, especially after instances of excitement or exertion. After such an incident, the heart resets itself after a few beats, but in some cases (such as this) the person is not so fortunate. An odder account of a \u201cdying laughing\u201d incident was reported in Bangkok in 2003:  An ice cream truck driver in Thailand died while laughing in his sleep. Damnoen Saen-um, 52, laughed for about two minutes yesterday and then stopped breathing, The Nation newspaper reported. Damnoen\u2019s wife tried to wake him up but he kept laughing. An autopsy suggested that he might have had a heart attack. \u201cI have never seen a case like this. But it is possible that a person could have heart seizure while laughing or crying too hard in their sleep,\u201d said Dr Somchai Chakrabhand, deputy director-general of the Mental Health Department. On the anecdotal side, Schott\u2019s Original Miscellany attributes the death of Burmese king Nandabayin in 1599 to his having \u201claughed to death when informed, by a visiting Italian merchant, that Venice was a free state without a king.\u201d  And on the fictional front, one version of the demise of Pecos Bill, the legendary cowboy hero of American folklore, has him dying from laughter after an encounter with a Boston dude:  When Bill was gettin\u2019 on in years, a Boston man came down to New Mexico for a visit. He fancied himself a bit of a cowboy. Got himself one of them mail-order suits, don\u2019t ya know. The ones with the lizard skin boots, a shiny brass belt buckle, a new pair of blue jeans and a huge ten gallon hat with not a speck of dust on it. Well, when Pecos Bill saw him trying to swagger into a bar, he jest lay down on the sidewalk and laughed himself to death! Not enough information was given in the (real) cases cited above to know whether laughter was a coincidental, contributory, or causal element of the deaths, but linguistically we\u2019ve been tossing about \u201cdying laughing\u201d expressions for centuries; the Oxford English Dictionary records a use of this phrase as far back as 1596 (\u201cWent they not quickly, I should die with laughing\u201d). We also employ similar phrases to indicate intense feelings of humiliation (\u201cI almost died of embarrassment\u201d), and in a more generic sense we use \u2018dying\u2019 to indicate great longing (\u201cI\u2019m just dying to see you\u201d) or excellence (\u201cIt\u2019s to die for\u201d).

Were those bills a joke, or was Bee talking about legislation that actually passed the Senate? Snowmobile racing The Senate passed a bill in March that would allow people under the age of 18 to compete in organized snowmobile racing events without a safety certificate from the state. Current law requires anyone under the age of 18 to take a state-approved safety course before they ride a snowmobile. Anyone under 14 has to also be supervised by an adult when riding. The regulations do not apply if the minor rides on land owned by their parent or guardian. The bill would throw out those rules as long as the minor is participating in a snowmobile racing event. The bill, sponsored by Republican Sen. Betty Little of the North Country, passed the 63-member Senate with 49 votes. The Assembly did not take up the bill. Looser hunting restrictions Another bill, passed by the Senate in June, would allow 12-year-olds to get a universal hunting license by lowering the age for some hunting activities. You can start hunting when you are 12 in New York, but certain restrictions remain until the hunter is 14. The bill would drop the age from 14 to 12 for someone to participate in muzzle-loading season, obtain muzzle-loading privileges, hunt with a crossbow, and hunt big game. The child would have to be supervised by a parent or youth mentor. The sponsor, Republican Joseph Griffo, says in the bill\u2019s memo it\u2019s intended to give parents the opportunity to teach children about hunting at a younger age. The bill passed the Senate with 53 votes. The Assembly did not take it up. Begging for money The third bill targets people who use children to panhandle on the street. It\u2019s already illegal for someone to use a child to beg for money but the crime is under the state\u2019s arts and cultural affairs law instead of the penal law. This bill, sponsored by Democratic Sen. Jeffrey Klein of the Bronx, would transfer the crime to the penal law and strengthen the penalty for repeat offenders. The bill says someone cannot ask or allow a child under 16 to beg for money or receive payment for \"\"picking rags, or collecting cigar stumps, or collecting bones.\"\" That provision has actually been in state law since 1971. It\u2019s part of a broader law that bans children from doing several things for money.

Few states are rebooting quicker than Texas, where stay-at-home orders expired May 1.

Greg Abbott has defended the pace by emphasizing that hospitalization and infection rates are steady, and pointing out that Texas\u2019 1,200 deaths still lag similarly big states, including California and Florida. The true number of cases and deaths is likely higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected without feeling sick. Even so, on the cusp of even more restrictions ending Monday, including gyms being cleared to reopen, a political confrontation is growing over attempts by big cities to keep some guardrails in place. The dispute underscores the gulf between Democrats who run city halls and GOP leaders who call the shots in the capital in Texas, one of a number of states where local officials and governors have clashed over restrictions during the pandemic. The renewed tensions come at a moment when Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, warned Congress this week of \u201cneedless suffering and death\u201d if the U.S. moves too quickly. Nevertheless, Wisconsin\u2019s courts tossed out the state\u2019s stay-at-home orders, throwing communities into chaos as some bars opened immediately while strict local restrictions were kept elsewhere. In Georgia, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms has also expressed unease at the speed that Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has reopened the state. Oklahoma lawmakers, irritated by local officials who imposed stricter measures during this health crisis, passed a House bill Thursday that would weaken the power of cities during the next one. And in Texas, Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton this week lashed out at the cities of Dallas, Austin and San Antonio over what he called \u201cunlawful\u201d local orders that are tougher than restrictions prescribed by Abbott, and threatened lawsuits if the cities don\u2019t back off. The warning came one day after El Paso pleaded to postpone easing up on any more lockdown measures in light of the number of COVID-19 cases there surging 60% over the past two weeks. \u201cUnfortunately, a few Texas counties and cities seem to have confused recommendations with requirements and have grossly exceeded state law to impose their own will on private citizens and businesses,\u201d Paxton said. City leaders said their local orders, which include more stringent emphasis on face coverings in public and restaurant protocols that aren\u2019t strictly enforced, don\u2019t conflict. El Paso County Judge Ricardo Samaniego, the county\u2019s top elected official, said he made his case to the governor during a phone call and asked for a few more weeks to assess data and reduce cases before more restrictions are lifted. But he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll get an answer before Abbott\u2019s public announcement Monday. \u201cI\u2019m not fighting his plan, I\u2019m fighting his timing,\u201d Samaniego said. \u201cIt looks like it would work for us months from now.\u201d The spat is a reversal from the early days of the outbreak in Texas, when Abbott gave cities and counties wide latitude to issue restrictions as they saw fit. But Abbott has since taken the reins over how quickly Texas will reboot, which last week included moving up the reopening of hair salons following complaints from conservatives. Testing for most of May has fallen well short of Abbott\u2019s stated goal of 30,000 per day, although testing numbers have surged in recent days, according to state health officials. Overflow hospitals set up in Dallas and Houston were dismantled without ever being used, and the rate of new cases in Texas has dropped since April even as testing has expanded, down to a seven-day average of 5.3% as of Thursday, according to data from Abbott\u2019s office. But experts still worry. \u201cThey see the decline going in and they pat themselves on the back and say, \u2018Look at the good work we\u2019ve done, now we can let this happen and open up things,\u2019\u201d said Dennis Perrotta, a retired state epidemiologist in Texas. \u201cAnd then we get slammed with a second peak.\u201d  In Austin, restaurants have grumbled over recommendations to log dine-in customers for the purposes of contact tracing, coupled with a warning that health officials otherwise might have to publicly out eateries if outbreaks spread. Some restaurateurs saw that as a threat, but at The Peached Tortilla, owner Eric Silverstein says his industry has to do what it takes to reopen. \u201cWe have no choice,\u201d he said. \u201cYou kind of have to going back to doing some form of business.\u201d A few blocks away at Brentwood Social House, a neighborhood coffee shop, owner Suzanne Daniels isn\u2019t so sure. Though her competitors have reopened, her indoor seating remains closed, and she doesn\u2019t know when she\u2019ll feel safe to follow them. \u201cIt feels early,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cIn my gut, it doesn\u2019t feel right or good.\u201d ___ Associated Press writers Sean Murphy in Oklahoma City, Cedar Attanasio in El Paso and Terry Wallace in Dallas contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak", "output": "Tensions rise as Texas governor readies to lift more rules.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "The story tackles this issue head on, as here: \u201cNovartis has not disclosed the price for its therapy, but analysts are predicting $300,000 to $600,000 for a one-time infusion.\u201d This is satisfactory, but barely. Here\u2019s how the story addresses benefits for the CAR T-cell treatment: \u201cIn the pivotal trial testing the therapy in almost a dozen countries, 83 percent of patients went into remission. A year later, two-thirds remained so.\u201d That information would be much more useful if it placed those numbers in context. For example, how many patients were enrolled in the study? 83 percent could be 13 out of 16 patients, or it could be 1,328 patients out of 1,600. And how does 83 percent compare to standard treatment? Similarly, is the story telling us that two-thirds of all patients were still in remission a year later? Or did it mean that two-thirds of the 83 percent were still in remission a year later? Contextual information would have provided some much-needed clarity here. The story notes: \u201cThe revved-up immune system [that results from the CAR T-cell treatment] becomes a potent cancer-fighting agent but also a dangerous threat to the patient. Serious side effects abound, raising concerns about broad use.\u201d The story then goes on to discuss those potential harms more thoroughly. Ordinarily, this would be sufficient for a Satisfactory rating. But given the severity and frequency of serious, life-threatening events, the story needed numbers: What percentage of patients in the trial experienced a serious immune reaction? How many died? There are also plenty of unknowns with a new cancer treatment, such as lack of data on long-term prognosis. The story refers to a \u201cpivotal trial testing the therapy in almost a dozen countries,\u201d but offers little additional information. While the story offers an in-depth history of the research that led up to this treatment, readers are given very little information about the trials that provide insight into how well the treatment works and its associated risks. There\u2019s really no disease mongering here, though there is one point that we\u2019d like to single out. The story states that the CAR T-cell treatment \u201cinitially would be available only for the small number of children and young adults whose leukemia does not respond to standard care. Those patients typically have a grim prognosis\u201d [emphasis added]. What does it mean to \u201ctypically have a grim prognosis\u201d? It\u2019s a fine turn of phrase, but it doesn\u2019t actually convey much information \u2014 and it\u2019s scary. In a case like this, it would likely be better to let the numbers speak for themselves. Or, if a story does include this sort of language, to back it up with some numbers. All of the sources in the story are patients, parents of patients, are associated with the pharmaceutical industry, or were involved with the relevant research being discussed. That said, the sources \u2014 and their conflicts of interest \u2014 were all clearly identified. Still, the story would have benefited from some independent, expert input. First of all, the story makes clear that CAR T-cell treatment \u2014 if approved \u2014 would be available only to those for whom conventional treatments have not worked. That\u2019s a key point. Second, the story does articulate the difference between this form of immunotherapy (which is customized to the patient) and other immunotherapy techniques, which are so-called \u201ccheckpoint inhibitors\u201d and are not individualized. As mentioned earlier, we would have liked to have seen more data on the success rates of standard treatment vs these treatments. The story clearly lays out where this treatment is in the FDA review process, how that process may unfold, and what this may mean for future availability. In addition, the story explains that CAR T-cell treatment would not be rolled out universally, but \u2014 if approved \u2014 would be available only through designated treatment facilities that have the relevant expertise. The story does a good job here, articulating what makes this treatment novel and how it works relative to other immunotherapy treatments.

Bernie Sanders of Vermont rose to the defense of marijuana. Critical of the nation\u2019s war on drugs, Sanders said the lives of millions of Americans have been \"\"ruined\"\" because they got a police record for possessing marijuana. \"\"Today, under the federal Controlled Substance Act, marijuana is listed in the same Schedule I as heroin. That is nuts,\"\" Sanders declared March 26, 2016, 10 days before he defeated Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin\u2019s Democratic primary. \"\"Now people can argue -- although I suspect in this audience there may not be much of an argument -- about the pluses and minuses of marijuana,\"\" he said, drawing cheers from some of the thousands in attendance at the Alliant Energy Center. \"\"But everybody knows marijuana is not a killer drug like heroin.\"\" Sanders then noted he had introduced legislation to remove marijuana from the Controlled Substance Act because possession of it \"\"should not be a federal crime.\"\" We found that Sanders wasn\u2019t smoking anything funny in claiming that both marijuana and heroin are Schedule I drugs, which he has continued to say while campaigning in New York and Pennsylvania. But his claim is somewhat misleading: That classification is based on a drug\u2019s acceptable medical use and the drug\u2019s abuse or dependency potential, not on criminal statutes. The law The Controlled Substance Act, adopted in 1970, uses five schedules to classify drugs and narcotics by medical use and potential to incite substance abuse. On the low end is Schedule V, which includes substances such as cough medicines with small amounts of the narcotic codeine. At the high end is Schedule I, which lists the \"\"most dangerous\"\" drugs -- those that have \"\"no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\"\" Marijuana is stronger than when the Controlled Substance Act was adopted (as ex-GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina correctly stated). Nevertheless Schedule II includes some drugs often considered more dangerous than marijuana. Here\u2019s a look at some of the drugs in the two schedules: Schedule I Schedule II Marijuana Cocaine Heroin Methamphetamine LSD Methadone Ecstasy OxyContin Peyote Fentanyl The Huffington Post in April 2016, citing figures from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the nation recorded no marijuana overdose deaths in 2015. Likewise, there were zero in 2014. It\u2019s possible marijuana might soon be moved off of Schedule I. A week after Sanders\u2019 speech, the Washington Post reported that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration said it hopes to decide by July 2016 whether to change the federal status of marijuana. Now let\u2019s get to Sanders\u2019 implication that the schedule relates to criminal law enforcement. Marijuana treated differently Distribution, manufacturing or possession of a Schedule I substance is indeed a federal offense. Additionally, marijuana being on Schedule I, drug policy experts told us, makes it more difficult for licensed dealers in states that have legalized marijuana or medical marijuana to get bank accounts and to deduct business expenses on their taxes. And the classification makes it more difficult for researchers to study marijuana in clinical trials. But judges come down harder on heroin possession than marijuana possession. And when it comes to enforcement of criminal statutes, the federal government to some extent has looked the other way when it comes to marijuana. As PolitiFact National stated in a related fact check: Schedule I substances cannot legally be used for medical purposes, however, 20 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws legalizing medical marijuana. In 2009, the administration of President Barack Obama, a Democrat, told federal law enforcement agencies to stop targeting medical marijuana dispensaries, signaling a change from the approach of Obama\u2019s predecessor, Republican President George W. Bush. Similarly, in 2013, the Department of Justice said it would not target new laws in Colorado and Washington legalizing recreational marijuana. While Sanders equates the handling or marijuana and heroin, it\u2019s difficult to imagine the federal government not enforcing the law if states started legalizing heroin. Our rating Criticizing the nation\u2019s war on drugs, Sanders says that under the federal Controlled Substance Act, \"\"marijuana is listed in the same Schedule I as heroin,\"\" even though \"\"marijuana is not a killer drug like heroin.\"\" Like heroin, marijuana is indeed listed as a Schedule I drug, the federal designation given to drugs considered the most dangerous. But at least under the Obama administration, the federal government doesn\u2019t treat it as one under the law.

The WHO reiterated there is no evidence as yet of any easy or sustained person-to-person transmission of the strain, and that the source of the human infections is still under investigation.

The journal article says several institutions refused to provide their prices. Nevertheless, the high cost of robotic surgery is an important issue. The researchers wrote they were unable to say whether those high costs might be offset [or not] by certain potential benefits (such as shorter hospital stays), but the release should have at least acknowledged the cost issues. The release does report the percentage of patients in the robot-assisted and open surgery groups that were still alive with no signs of disease progression two years after their procedures: 72.3 percent of patients in the robotic surgery group compared with 71.6 percent in the open surgery group\u2026 and it notes the difference was not statistically significant. It also reports that the robot-assisted surgery patients checked out of the hospital after six days on average, compared to 7 days for those in the open surgery group. The release reports only half as much blood loss in the robot surgery group, but does not report the amounts, which averaged 300 mL in the robot-assisted group vs. 700 mL in the open surgery group\u2026 that\u2019s a difference of less than one pint. The release reports that patients who had robot-assisted surgery spent more time in the operating room than those having open procedures (seven hours vs. six hours). It also reports overall rates of adverse effects (67 percent in the robot group vs. 69 percent in the open group), along with listing the most common problems: urinary tract infections and intestinal obstructions. It would have helped if the release had pointed out that these complication rates were not statistically different. In a way, the release is satisfactory and yet maddeningly unsatisfactory. It tells readers that the study was a randomly controlled trial with 350 patients, but it buries the most important point: that the ability of these researchers to do this sort of rigorous trial comparing robot-assisted surgery with open techniques highlights how few such trials are done. Deep in the release, the researchers are quoted as saying the findings \u201cunderscore the need for further high-quality trials to assess surgical innovation before this surgical technique is widely adopted in clinical practice\u201d and further that \u201cIt is important to conduct these trials before widespread adoption of technology, as has been the case with robotic prostatectomy (removal of the prostate).\u201d The quality of the evidence should have been the lead. The release does not exaggerate the prevalence of bladder cancer. It does not push treatment on those who are unlikely to benefit. The release could be interpreted as promoting a newer more expensive form of therapy that doesn\u2019t provide any advantages over the standard therapy. Although the release reports that the study was supported by the National Cancer Institute, it fails to note the financial disclosures several researchers made about money they have received from companies relevant to this study. The comparison of robot-assisted to open surgery was the main point of the release. The release makes clear that both techniques are available\u2026 including at the institution that issued the release. The release could have informed readers that, according to the published paper, that all of\u00a0the operators in this study had\u00a0done at least 10 robot-assisted cystectomies before being allowed to participate in the study. When widespread adoption of the robot-assisted procedure occurs, it would be possible that many surgeons would not have completed that many robotic cystectomies. While the release does tell readers that what is really new here is the use of randomization to compare robot-assisted surgery to open surgery for bladder cancer, it manages to bury that lead so deep under the poorly worded description of the results of this non-inferiority trial that the thrust of the release is unsatisfactory.

A survey by the European Centre for Diseases Prevention and Control (ECDC) found that on any given day, one in 18 patients in European hospitals has at least one hospital-acquired infection - amounting to around 3.2 million patients per year. \u201cHealthcare-associated infections pose a major public health problem and a threat to European patients,\u201d said Marc Sprenger, director of the Stockholm-based ECDC. He said many of these infections could be prevented by well thought-out, sustained and multi-pronged prevention and control programs and he urged hospitals to step up the fight. \u201cSuch programs, as well as prudent use of antibiotics, will help all actors involved to protect the patients of European hospitals,\u201d he said in a statement. The ECDC warned last year that doctors are increasingly having to turn to last-ditch antibiotics due to growing drug-resistant superbug infections in Europe - many of them acquired in hospitals. The latest survey, which covered 1,000 hospitals in 30 European countries, found the highest rates of hospital-acquired infections were among patients admitted to intensive care units, where 19.5 percent of patients had at least one bug they had picked up from the hospital. The most common types of infection are respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia and infections of the bloodstream. These are often caused by Klebsiella pneumonia and E. coli bacteria, both of which have shown an ability to develop resistance to some of the most powerful antibiotics. Among a total 15,000 reported healthcare-associated infections, surgical site infections and urinary tract infections are also common. Many of the infections are also found to be drug-resistant \u201csuperbugs\u201d, the survey showed. Among all infections with Staphylococcus aureus bacteria in which full testing was carried out, more than 40 percent were reported as resistant to methicillin - in other words they were MRSA infections, the ECDC said. Worldwide, MRSA infects an estimated 53 million people annually and costs more than $20 billion a year to treat. It kills around 20,000 people a year in the United States and a similar number in Europe. EU health and consumer affairs commissioner Paola Testori Coggi said the findings of the European survey were \u201cworrying\u201d and urged health authorities to do more to protect patients in hospital and to step up the fight against antibiotic resistance. Drug resistance is driven by the misuse and overuse of antibiotics, which encourages bacteria to develop new ways of overcoming them.

The show is part of its efforts to help fight diseases causing diarrhea, which kill more children than malaria, HIV/AIDS and measles combined. \u201cPeople don\u2019t talk about poo enough, and if we don\u2019t talk about poo, how are we going to solve the problem of diarrheal diseases?\u201d asked Val Curtis, director of the LSHTM\u2019s Hygiene Centre. \u201cWe want to make shit sexy - make talking about shit possible,\u201d Curtis told AlertNet, a humanitarian news service run by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, adding that proper handwashing with soap could prevent 600,000 deaths a year from diseases like diarrhea and respiratory infections. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to know your enemy and look your enemy in the face. Some people say it\u2019s not acceptable for academics to go around talking about shit, but it\u2019s not acceptable for 600,000 children to be dying unnecessarily because we don\u2019t talk about shit,\u201d she said. The month-long exhibition, which includes a selection of toilet designs, scientific tools for the study of faeces and a small golden poo sculpture seated on a red cushion, is timed to coincide with Global Handwashing Day on October 15 and World Toilet Day on November 19. The school expects at least 4,000 people to see the show. The poo sculpture is the model for The Golden Poo Award 2012 - the Oscar of the sanitation sector, organized by PooP Creative Ltd and the London Short Film Festival. A film titled \u201cMen, Loos and Number Twos\u201d won the \u201cNumber One Award\u201d, and another short film, \u201cPushing4Change\u201d, won the \u201cNumber Two Award\u201d.

The toilet doesn\u2019t use very much water - around two liters per flush - so it places less demand on natural water sources and power than conventional septic tank or sewage systems. The LSHTM, a university specializing in public health and tropical medicine, is also researching the human waste found in pit latrines in Africa and Vietnam to help find new ways to dispose of it. It is also looking at human behavior to figure out the best way of getting people to increase handwashing. \u201cIf you ask people if they wash their hands with soap, about 90 percent say they do, but actually if you go and measure it - as we have in 20 countries - the average rate of handwashing with soap after going to the toilet is about 17 percent,\u201d Curtis said.

Scientists plan to extract the active ingredients from the cannabis for use in the treatment of 200 cancer patients who signed up via the local healthcare system or through the foundation. \u201cIf there is a therapeutic property to cannabis that relieves pain it would be a criminal irresponsibility as a leader not to give it to citizens who need it,\u201d Carter said at the farm, where the strong smell of marijuana lingers and security staff keep a watchful eye.

Some deviate from this standard by providing additional information about the departed, information that is almost always of a laudatory nature. However, every now and again one encounters a written send-off that is far from the expected loving expression of facts about the person who died. Such was the case with the obituary of Dolores Aguilar. The obit for this 79-year-old woman ran on 16 and 17 August 2008 in the Vallejo [California] Times-Herald. It was placed by one of the deceased\u2019s many daughters. According to John Bogert of the Daily Breeze (a newspaper based in the South Bay area of  Los Angeles), Dolores Aguilar\u2019s daughter was moved to place the notice after reviewing the obituary of a co-worker\u2019s father and noting as she read through it how little any of it fit her mother. \u201cWhat struck me was how my mother was none of the things I was reading. She was never there for us, she was never good and she left no legacy. So how could I say any of the usual things about her?\u201d said the daughter to Bogert. She and her siblings, she maintained, were kept \u201cunfed, poorly clothed and completely terrorized.\u201d  Before agreeing to run the unusual obituary, the Times-Herald took the additional step of requesting a copy of the death certificate, just to ensure that what they were being asked to publish wasn\u2019t a hoax. It wasn\u2019t: the woman being memorialized had passed away on 7 August 2008. On 10 September 2013, the Reno Gazette-Journal published a similar obituary (in both its print and online versions) for Marianne Theresa Johnson-Reddick, who had passed away at the age of 78 and was described in her obit as having \u201cneglected and abused her small children\u201d and lived an \u201cevil and violent life\u201d:  Marianne Theresa Johnson-Reddick born Jan 4, 1935 and died alone on Aug. 30, 2013. She is survived by her 6 of 8 children whom she spent her lifetime torturing in every way possible. While she neglected and abused her small children, she refused to allow anyone else to care or show compassion towards them. When they became adults she stalked and tortured anyone they dared to love. Everyone she met, adult or child was tortured by her cruelty and exposure to violence, criminal activity, vulgarity, and hatred of the gentle or kind human spirit. On behalf of her children whom she so abrasively exposed to her evil and violent life, we celebrate her passing from this earth and hope she lives in the after-life reliving each gesture of violence, cruelty, and shame that she delivered on her children. Her surviving children will now live the rest of their lives with the peace of knowing their nightmare finally has some form of closure. Most of us have found peace in helping those who have been exposed to child abuse and hope this message of her final passing can revive our message that abusing children is unforgivable, shameless, and should not be tolerated in a \u201chumane society\u201d. Our greatest wish now, is to stimulate a national movement that mandates a purposeful and dedicated war against child abuse in the United States of America. Johnson-Reddick\u2019s unusual obituary quickly garnered national attention, and the Gazette-Journal published a follow-up article explaining its origins:  Katherine Reddick, 57, said she wrote the obituary about her mother, 78, who died at a Reno nursing home. Her mother had bladder cancer and had become a ward of the state when she became sick and was hospitalized. The two were not in contact. Katherine Reddick, who works in education in Texas, described a horrific childhood that she and her brothers and sisters endured. Moved from California to Las Vegas to eventually live in an orphanage in Carson City, she described being abused for years by her mother and in multiple foster homes. Reddick said she slept on the floors of places where her mother ran escort businesses. From 1963 to 1964, six of Johnson-Reddick\u2019s [eight] children were admitted to the Nevada Children\u2019s Home in Carson City, the long-standing orphanage that closed in 1992. The children lived there until they either turned 18, joined the military, got married or were ordered to go back and live with their mother, according to state documents at the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services. \u201cWe were constantly physically, mentally abused even after being taken away and put in the children\u2019s home,\u201d Patrick Reddick said during testimony in 1987. He said that on weekends, they were sent home to an office in Reno, sometimes lined up and beaten with a steel-tipped belt. Katherine and her brother Patrick said they talked about writing the obituary after learning about their mother\u2019s death. Both are graduates of Carson High School. They said they did not expect the obituary to garner national attention. \u201cPeople may see this as something we did to shame our mother,\u201d Patrick Reddick, the second oldest of eight children, said in a phone interview. \u201cBut this is to bring shame to the issue of child abuse.

Duncan Hunter, a Republican from California, argued that the issue really comes down to waterboarding. \"\"And,\"\" he said, \"\"waterboarding is not torture.\"\" In fact, said Hunter, a Vietnam veteran and former candidate for president, \"\"We waterboard, incidentally, hundreds of our own military personnel. They waterboard themselves in training to toughen themselves up.\"\" He added, \"\"The Geneva Convention .. .was analyzed by the lawyers in place, and they came to the conclusion, especially about waterboarding, because that's the primary thing, that, since we do it to our own soldiers, by the hundreds, incidentally, and it doesn't hurt them, and they \u2014 and it makes them tougher, and it doesn't hurt anybody \u2014 Khalid Sheikh Mohammed gained weight after he was waterboarded \u2014 we decided that, since we do that to our own soldiers in training... we\u2018re not going to consider that torture. \"\" Hunter later challenged host Chris Matthews saying, \"\"But the point is, if we do it, are we torturing American soldiers? You have to answer yes if you consider waterboarding to be torture.\"\" Matthews said the difference is that U.S. service people know they are in training. They know they aren't going to be killed. \"\"That captured person who is one of our enemies has no idea what we\u2018re doing when we submit him to water torture.\"\" Said Hunter: \"\"If we use it with our own soldiers in training, as we do waterboarding, then it should be allowed with people who have killed thousands of Americans.\"\" We decided to examine Hunter's claim about waterboarding our service personnel as part of their training and found that he is right. U.S. special operations troops have, in the past, sometimes used a form of waterboarding as part of survival exercises, called Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape training. The idea is to prepare them in the event they are ever captured and interrogated with such means. According to reports in the  New York Times  and  Vanity Fair,  the CIA adopted some of the interrogation techniques used on terror suspects from that SERE training, including the use of waterboarding. According to the  Vanity Fair  story, three-week SERE training for the U.S. soldiers included waterboarding, forced nudity, extreme temperatures, sexual and religious ridicule, agonizing stress positions, and starvation-level rations. The story quotes Michael Rolince, former section chief of the FBI's International Terrorism Operations: \"\"You're not going to die, but you think you are.\"\" But while the techniques may have been derived from SERE training, a different, more intense brand of waterboarding was used on terror suspects, according to recently released CIA documents. According to a May 7, 2004, CIA Inspector General special report on interrogation techniques used on terror suspects, which has some parts redacted, \"\"OIG\u2019s (Office of the Inspector General's) review of the videotapes revealed that the waterboard technique employed at (redacted) was different from the technique as described in the DoJ (Department of Justice) opinion and used in the SERE training. The difference was in the manner in which the detainee\u2019s breathing was obstructed. At the SERE School and in the DoJ opinion, the subject\u2019s airflow is disrupted by the firm application of a damp cloth over the air passages; the interrogator applies a small amount of water to the cloth in a controlled manner. By contest, the Agency interrogator (redacted) continuously applied large volumes of water to a cloth that covered the detainee\u2019s mouth and nose. One of the psychologists/interrogators acknowledged that the Agency\u2019s use of the technique differed from that used in SERE training and explained that the Agency\u2019s technique is different because it is 'for real' and is more poignant and convincing.\"\" The report also says the CIA's Office of Medical Services has characterized the SERE waterboarding as \"\"so different from the subsequent Agency usage as to make it almost irrelevant.\"\" The office said its frequency and intensity raised questions about whether it was effective or medically safe. So we think Hunter misleads a bit by equating waterboarding in training of military personnel with the technique used on terror suspects. According to the CIA inspector general's report, the technique used on the suspects was more powerful and convincing. And in the case of one terror suspect, it was used 183 times, often in rapid succession. So to argue the technique isn't torture because it is used on American servicemen as part of training ignores that it was not used in the same way. Still, Hunter is correct that the U.S. military has waterboarded servicemen as part of survival training.

Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., introduced legislation to bar insurance companies from implementing \"\"unfair\"\" hikes in health plan premiums. In a March 8, 2010, New York Times story, Feinstein explained why she cares so much about the issue. \"\"We are the only industrialized nation that relies heavily on a for-profit medical insurance industry to provide basic health care,\"\"\u00a0Feinstein said. \"\"I believe, fundamentally, that all medical insurance should be not-for-profit.\"\" We thought it would be worthwhile checking if Feinstein was right that no other nation \"\"relies heavily on a for-profit medical insurance industry to provide basic health care.\"\" As it turns out, some other countries do have private, for-profit insurance companies operating in their health care sector, and there are some indications that this sector is growing. But the business, legal and regulatory environment in which they operate is quite different than it is in the United States. A good example is the Netherlands. Dutch plans may be either non-profit or for-profit, as in the U.S. But children are fully covered using public funds, and premiums for adults are set at 50 percent of the expected costs, with the remainder paid through a national \"\"risk equalization fund\"\" -- essentially funds collected from the public at large. As a result, health insurers in the Netherlands aren't really able to compete for adult customers on price. By law, insurers must accept and renew all applicants, and a basic package of services must be offered. By contrast, U.S. insurers are free (for now, at least) to reject applicants on the individual market if they have pre-existing conditions, and insurers offer a panoply of plans with different premium levels and benefit packages. So, in the Netherlands, even the for-profit insurers don't typically make much of a profit on their basic health care lines. Meanwhile, in Switzerland, any profit that insurers make on basic services must be plowed back into reducing premiums. So why even call these companies for-profit? In many of the European countries with a for-profit health insurance sector, the companies make their profits not on basic health care -- the kind that Feinstein specifically referred to -- but by up-selling their health care customers on supplemental health coverage, such as dental care, eyeglasses, cosmetic surgery or more luxurious hospital rooms, or other product lines altogether, such as life or homeowner's insurance. \"\"There's no developed country where insurers can make a profit on basic coverage,\"\" said T.R. Reid, the author of The Healing of America: A Global Quest for Better, Cheaper, and Fairer Health Care. \"\"Their mission is to pay for health care, not to pay investors.\"\" Maggie Mahar, a fellow who specializes in international health care policy at the Century Foundation, agrees. \"\"I usually say that the U.S. is the only country in the developed world that has chosen to turn health care into largely unregulated, for-profit enterprise,\"\" she said. Technically, for-profit companies do provide basic medical care in countries such as the Netherlands, and there's enough of it going on to say that such countries \"\"rely\"\" on those insurers to serve that need. But the profit these companies make -- or at least the vast majority of it -- is made from lines of business other than basic health care. Because there is no official definition of \"\"basic health care\"\" in the U.S. system, it is hard to calculate exactly how much profit American insurers are making off basic services. But whatever it is, most experts expect that it is higher than the margins being made on basic health care by for-profit insurers in other countries. We believe that Feinstein is right that the U.S. for-profit insurance industry's role in basic health care is fundamentally different than what goes on in other countries, and that this outweighs her technical error in saying that no other country relies heavily on a for-profit medical insurance industry to provide basic health care.\"", "output": "We are the only industrialized nation that relies heavily on a for-profit medical insurance industry to provide basic health care.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "Plastic mulch, basically thin sheeting placed over individual crops, is used throughout China\u2019s arid and dusty north to improve growing conditions and boost yields by retaining moisture for crops and suppressing weeds.

Malaysian authorities have been conducting cloud seeding operations in an attempt to clear the haze and are considering passage of a law that would penalize Malaysian plantation companies that start fires abroad.

Singapore, directly across the Strait of Malacca from Indonesia\u2019s Riau province on the island of Sumatra, experienced air pollution levels ranging between moderate and unhealthy levels on Thursday. Elevated levels of PM2.5, tiny airborne particulates, caused Singaporean authorities to issue health advisories to limit outdoor activities, especially among the elderly, pregnant women and children.

Missouri officials were staying mum, while Democrats and abortion-rights supporters decried what they called government overreach into women\u2019s private lives. During testimony Tuesday, Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services Director Randall Williams said the spreadsheet was compiled at his request. He said the goal was to find women who had what the state calls \u201cfailed abortions,\u201d in which a woman is still pregnant after an abortion and needs more than one procedure to complete it. McNicholas told the administrative hearing that the Planned Parenthood clinic in St. Louis followed protocol in all of the instances cited by the state. She said that while a surgical abortion is safer than even a colonoscopy or tonsillectomy, complications do happen. Yamelsie Rodriguez, president and CEO of Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region, told reporters that the organization learned of Williams\u2019 spreadsheet from his testimony. She did not know how many patients were listed on the spreadsheet. \u201cI think what is deeply disturbing about that is the fact that Director Randall Williams is using his position of authority and power to push a political agenda in order to try to end access to safe and legal abortion in the state of Missouri,\u201d Rodriguez said. Williams declined an interview request, and spokeswomen for him and Gov. Mike Parson didn\u2019t respond to messages seeking comment. But Wednesday night the health department emailed a statement denying Williams compiled spreadsheets tracking menstrual cycles, claiming that his testimony was misinterpreted. According to the statement, which was titled \u201cDHSS denies false allegation,\u201d the department investigated concerns about missing reports into failed surgical abortions by using \u201clegally-obtained information which was required by law and which Planned Parenthood routinely submits.\u201d The Associated Press also submitted open records requests seeking additional information. Williams testified that the spreadsheet contained information accessible by the state through its annual inspection, performed in March. It also included medication identification numbers, dates of procedures and the gestational ages of fetuses, The Kansas City Star reported. The spreadsheet did not include patients\u2019 names. The state has said it is concerned about patient care, and Williams called safety \u201cthe North Star\u201d of the licensing process. Missouri House Minority Leader Crystal Quade, a Democrat, called for an investigation to determine whether patient privacy was compromised or laws were broken. State Auditor Nicole Galloway, who is running for governor in 2020, called for Williams to be fired. The spreadsheet was developed after an inspector raised concerns about an abortion that took five procedures to complete. That led to an investigation that found four overall instances where women underwent multiple procedures to complete their abortions. Among those cases was one where the doctor missed that the patient was pregnant with twins, requiring two procedures five weeks apart, according to Williams\u2019 testimony. Elizabeth Nash, a state policy analyst for the Guttmacher Institute, a national research group that supports abortion rights and tracks abortion legislation, told the AP she hasn\u2019t heard of another case where a state agency has tracked menstruation as part of regulating a clinic. Dr. Jennifer Conti, a San Francisco-area abortion provider, said in an interview that tracking periods is not a reliable way to determine when a pregnancy has ended and suggested that data was used to avoid having to obtain women\u2019s consent for access to addition information. \u201cIt\u2019s very odd and it feels like an invasion of privacy,\u201d said Conti, who is a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health. The state moved to revoke the clinic\u2019s license in June, prompting a court fight that was turned over to the Missouri Administrative Hearing Commission, which is conducting the hearing. A ruling isn\u2019t expected before February. Missouri would become the first state since 1974, the year after the Supreme Court\u2019s Roe v. Wade decision, without a functioning abortion clinic if the license is revoked. Three clinics near Missouri offer the procedure.

After it appeared, the Heritage Foundation's communications office contacted us to argue that our rating of  was too generous to the president. We did some additional reporting to review our ruling. Our second round of reporting -- primarily talking to conservative policy experts outside of Heritage -- solidified our initial conclusions. Below is the updated version of our story, which retains the rating of , published April 26, 2010.Democrats like to parry Republican criticism of the recently passed health care law by talking about how it includes ideas that originated with conservatives. During an interview on NBC's Today show on March 30, 2010, President Barack Obama offered a specific example.Obama told host Matt Lauer that \"\"when you actually look at the bill itself, it incorporates all sorts of Republican ideas. I mean a lot of commentators have said this is sort of similar to the bill that Mitt Romney, the Republican governor and now presidential candidate, passed in Massachusetts. A lot of the ideas in terms of the exchange, just being able to pool and improve the purchasing power of individuals in the insurance market, that originated from the Heritage Foundation. ...\"\"We zeroed in on the notion that the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that is no fan of Obama's health care law as a whole, might have \"\"originated\"\" the idea of the health insurance exchange -- a virtual marketplace where individuals can purchase health insurance. Our interest only grew after we received an e-mail from Heritage president Ed Feulner that blasted Obama's claim. \"\"President Obama this morning cited the Heritage Foundation's research in an attempt to sell his health care package as a 'middle-of-the-road, centrist approach,'\"\" Feulner wrote. \"\"We take great exception to this misuse of our work and abuse of our name. This is but the latest act in a campaign to sell this big-government program as a moderate law that incorporates conservative ideas. Americans should not be fooled. \"\"Feulner went on to argue that \"\"the president knows full well \u2014 or he ought to learn before he speaks \u2014 that the exchanges we and most others support are very different from those in his package. True exchanges are simply a market mechanism to enable families to choose their health insurance. President Obama\u2019s exchanges, by contrast, are a vehicle to introduce sweeping regulation and federal standardization on health insurance. \"\"Heritage continued its campaign against Obama's claim in an April 19, 2010, op-ed column in the Washington Post. The director of Heritage's Center for Health Policy Studies, Robert Moffit, wrote that \"\"the version of the exchange we did develop couldn't be more different than that embodied in this law.\"\" He charged that \"\"the Obama health-care law 'builds' on the Heritage health reform model only in the sense that, say, a double-quarter-pounder with cheese 'builds' on the idea of a garden salad. Both have lettuce and tomato and may be called food, but the similarities end there. \"\"We see two related, but distinct, questions here. The first is whether Heritage did in fact \"\"originate\"\" the idea of health insurance exchanges. The second is whether the exchange prescribed by the new law mirrors the one that Heritage has supported.\u2022 Did Heritage originate the idea? Our research suggests that while Heritage has advocated for health insurance exchanges for many years, others did, too. Scholars credit Alain C. Enthoven -- an emeritus professor at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business who worked in the Defense Department during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations -- with popularizing the idea for an exchange as many as three decades ago.Still, there's little doubt that Heritage has been a consistent and eager promoter of the exchange idea, especially during the effort to design a new health care system for Massachusetts. That effort concluded with the Democratic legislature joining with the Republican governor, Romney, to implement a system that includes a health insurance exchange.On numerous occasions, Heritage scholars wrote approvingly of the exchange system in Massachusetts, known as the Connector. In a paper about the Massachusetts plan published on April 11, 2006, Edmund Haislmaier, a Heritage fellow in health care policy, wrote of the \"\"truly significant and transformative health system changes that the legislation would set in motion. \"\"Specifically, Haislmaier wrote that \"\"this concept of organizing a state's insurance markets around a central clearinghouse represents a dramatic departure from recent state health insurance reform proposals. States have spent the past 15 years trying to expand health care coverage to small-business employees, with virtually no positive results. The Massachusetts legislation represents a bipartisan commitment to move away from the policies that have largely failed to make progress in covering the uninsured for the past 15 years. \"\"In another paper, titled, \"\"The Rationale for a Statewide Health Insurance Exchange,\"\" and published on Oct. 5, 2006, Heritage scholar Robert Moffit wrote that \"\"the best option is a health insurance market exchange.\"\" Comparing it to a farmers' market or the used-car dealer CarMax, Moffit said the exchange \"\"would expand coverage and choice\"\" and would represent \"\"a revolutionary change in the health insurance market. \"\"Journalists seemed to give Heritage credit, as well. During 2006, columns and articles citing Heritage's role in promoting the health exchange idea ran in such publications as the Washington Post, the Dallas Morning News, the New Orleans Times-Picayune and the National Review.We feel the president is largely right on this point. The idea for exchanges may have \"\"originated\"\" outside Heritage, but in well over a decade leading up to the introduction of the president's health care plan, Heritage clearly took a high-profile role in touting it, culminating in the proposal enacted in Massachusetts. And given that, they can hardly be shocked that the president is noting the think tank's role in developing the overall concept (even if he did so in a self-serving way).\u2022 Is it the same idea? After Obama made his comment, we spoke to both Haislmaier and to Stuart Butler, Heritage's vice president for domestic policy. Both argued that the plan now enacted into law is fundamentally different in structure than the one Heritage advocated. \"\"What Obama and Capitol Hill did was to take a mainstream idea and push it toward a much more interventionist, regulatory model, as opposed to the original idea, which was more market-based,\"\" Butler said in an interview.To prevent Heritage scholars from moving the goalposts after the fact, we decided to analyze how similar the proposals are only by referring to policy stances that can be documented in briefing papers published prior to Obama's election. We found at least four papers that spoke directly to the health insurance exchange idea, and in these papers, we noticed several passages that advocated elements of an exchange that differ from how the bill was ultimately written.Here are some of those differences:-- Who can use the exchange? In a 2006 paper, Moffit wrote, \"\"Ideally, an exchange should be open to all state residents and all interested employers, regardless of the size of the firm, who want to arrange health insurance through the exchange. \"\"That's not the case with the exchanges in the new law -- at least not any time soon. When the exchanges go live in 2014, they will only be open to people already buying insurance on the individual market (that is, those buying insurance independent of their employer) and to employees of small businesses with up to 100 employees. A provision does allow employees of businesses with more than 100 employees to purchase coverage from the exchange, but not until 2017, and only if their state decides to allow it. (The exception is that employees who are paying too large a percentage of their income on their employer-based health insurance will be eligible in 2014.) -- How much federal regulation will there be? Heritage scholars have regularly argued that the key regulatory role for the exchanges should be handled by the states, rather than the federal government.In a 2007 paper, Butler wrote that \"\"each state would determine on its own such features as the infrastructure for handling premiums, as well as the regulations and requirements for accepting insurance plans into the exchange. The state also would be responsible for determining pooling, reinsurance, and risk adjustment arrangements and the degree to which firms would, if at all, be required to offer plans available through the exchange to their employees. \"\"It's true that the new health care law will create state-based exchanges. However, they will have to adhere to many federal requirements.For instance, the federal law requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to define an \"\"essential health benefits package\"\" (and update its details every year). This will become the minimum package offered on the exchanges. The law also limits plans sold on the exchange to charging differential premiums only based on age (in a 3-to-1 ratio), geography, family composition and tobacco use (on a 1.5-to-1 ratio). And health plans on the exchange will have to abide by an assortment of other rules governing marketing requirements, provider networks and standards for presenting information to consumers.-- How portable will insurance be? In a 2007 paper published by Heritage, researcher Connie Marshner argued that health insurance exchanges would promote portability of health insurance. \"\"When individuals are able to purchase health insurance for themselves in an (exchange) marketplace, the insurance belongs to them,\"\" Marshner wrote. \"\"Even if they change jobs, move, or quit working and retire, they own the policy and can keep the same health insurance if they so choose. \"\"That should be the case for many people on the health care law's exchange, especially those who bought their insurance individually, as long as states don't erect high barriers that bar people from moving from one state's exchange to another. But full portability will be unlikely for those who purchased insurance on the exchange with the help of their employer. While the exchange should make it easier for those switching jobs to find new insurance, there will most likely be a disruption when that employee switches companies -- and whenever there's a disruption in coverage, there's a likelihood that their plan will have to change to one degree or another.So where does this leave us?Edwin Park, a senior fellow with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, sees significant similarities in approach despite the differences outlined above. Park said the differences involved \"\"rules of the road within the exchange, rather than fundamental differences in the underlying concept or structure. \"\"Henry Aaron, a fellow with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, called the new health care law \"\"a close relative\"\" of Heritage's plan -- \"\"not identical to be sure, but a sibling or at least a first cousin. The essence is that you have a government or nonprofit entity that regulates the sale of insurance to individuals or businesses in order to standardize offerings and to control selling methods in order to produce real, head-to-head competition and to provide customers information in forms they can readily understand. ... Yes, they are all different; but they are all of the same family. \"\"We also solicited the views of conservative policy experts beyond Heritage.One -- Tevi Troy, a visiting senior fellow at the Hudson Institute -- thought Heritage had a legitimate gripe. \"\"In the policy world, there is often a vast gulf between theoretical ideas and policies as implemented, and this case is no exception,\"\" Troy said. \"\"While Heritage had been a leading advocate for health insurance exchanges, the law as written creates something so different from what Heritage sought that I understand why they want to remove their name from the list of proponents. \"\"However, we heard from nine people affiliated with conservative policy organizations other than Heritage who thought that the president's statement was reasonably accurate.Seven of them declined to publicly express their differences with Heritage for fear of making waves within the tight-knit conservative policy world. But two did allow their names to be used. One was Dan Miller, executive vice president of the Chicago-based Heartland Institute, who acknowledged that Obama's statement was so carefully worded that the president \"\"was able to exploit\"\" the issue \"\"for his own ends. \"\"The other was Daniel McCarthy, senior editor of the American Conservative magazine who has written recently about the conservative origins of the president's health care plan. \"\"Every think tank on the left and right knows that its recommendations will undergo some deformation before they make their way into law, if they ever do,\"\" McCarthy told PolitiFact. \"\"Heritage might prefer state insurance exchanges with greater individual choice, including for workers already covered by their employers. But I don't imagine Ed Feulner would be complaining at all if a Republican president or a Republican Congress had passed a plan that deviated from the Heritage blueprint to the same degree that Obama's bill has. While it's not true that 'lots of' the specifics in the Obama plan were dreamed up by Heritage, the overall approach is similar to policies Heritage has long championed, including the individual mandate as well as the insurance exchanges. This is only controversial because the wrong party happened to pass the law, and it's poison for any conservative to be identified with it. \"\"We agree with Heritage that the differences between its original vision and the version enacted into law are not trivial, and are enough to undercut the president's effort to secure a Heritage Foundation seal of approval for his bill. But the president helped his case by wording his statement with extreme care. Intentionally or not, he gave himself subtle linguistic running room by saying that \"\"a lot of the ideas\"\" for the exchange came from Heritage, including the concept of \"\"just being able to pool and improve the purchasing power of individuals in the insurance market.\"\" Even if not all of the ideas in the two plans are identical, we feel that it was fair of him to say that \"\"a lot of the ideas\"\" are in common, including the notion of pooling. So we conclude that the president's statement qualifies as .\"", "output": "A lot of the ideas in terms of the (health insurance) exchange, just being able to pool and improve the purchasing power of individuals in the insurance market, that originated from the Heritage Foundation.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "\"Republican U.S. Rep.

It presents the pursuit of fundamental knowledge through basic research in a neutral manner that does not advocate any position regarding climate change or conservation research,\"\" she said.

The polar vortex has been wandering more often in recent years. It all started with misplaced Moroccan heat. Last month, the normally super chilly air temperatures 20 miles above the North Pole rapidly rose by about 125 degrees (70 degrees Celsius), thanks to air flowing in from the south. It\u2019s called \u201csudden stratospheric warming.\u201d That warmth split the polar vortex, leaving the pieces to wander, said Judah Cohen, a winter storm expert for Atmospheric Environmental Research, a commercial firm outside Boston. \u201cWhere the polar vortex goes, so goes the cold air,\u201d Cohen said. By Wednesday morning, one of those pieces will be over the Lower 48 states for the first time in years. The forecast calls for a low of minus 21 degrees (minus 29 Celsius) in Chicago and wind chills flirting with minus 65 degrees (minus 54 Celsius) in parts of Minnesota, according to the National Weather Service. The unusual cold could stick around another eight weeks, Cohen said. \u201cThe impacts from this split, we have a ways to go. It\u2019s not the end of the movie yet,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cI think at a minimum, we\u2019re looking at mid-February, possibly through mid-March.\u201d Americans were introduced to the polar vortex five years ago. It was in early January 2014 when temperatures dropped to minus 16 degrees (minus 27 Celsius) in Chicago and meteorologists, who used the term for decades, started talking about it on social media. This outbreak may snap some daily records for cold and is likely to be even more brutal than five years ago, especially with added wind chill, said Jeff Masters, meteorology director of the private weather firm Weather Underground. When warm air invades the polar region, it can split the vortex or displace it, usually toward Siberia, Cohen said. Recently, there have been more splits, which increase the odds of other places getting ultra-cold, he said. Pieces of the polar vortex have chilled Europe, Siberia and North America this time. (It\u2019s not right to call the frigid center of cold air the polar vortex because it is just a piece or a lobe, not the entire vortex, said University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado.) When the forces penning the polar vortex in the Arctic are weak, it wanders, more often to Siberia than Michigan. And it\u2019s happening more frequently in the last couple decades, Furtado said. A study a year ago in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society looked at decades of the Arctic system and found the polar vortex has shifted \u201ctoward more frequent weak states.\u201d When the polar vortex pieces wander, warmth invades the Arctic, Alaska, Greenland and Canada, Masters said. While the Midwest chills, Australia has been broiling to record-breaking heat. The world as a whole on Monday was 0.7 degrees (0.4 degrees Celsius) warmer than the 1979-2000 average, according to the University of Maine\u2019s Climate Reanalyzer. Some scientists \u2014 but by no means most \u2014 see a connection between human-caused climate change and difference in atmospheric pressure that causes slower moving waves in the air. \u201cIt\u2019s a complicated story that involves a hefty dose of chaos and an interplay among multiple influences, so extracting a clear signal of the Arctic\u2019s role is challenging,\u201d said Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at the Woods Hole Research Center. Several recent papers have made the case for the connection, she noted. \u201cThis symptom of global warming is counterintuitive for those in the cross-hairs of these extreme cold spells,\u201d Francis said in an email. \u201cBut these events provide an excellent opportunity to help the public understand some of the \u2018interesting\u2019 ways that climate change will unfold.\u201d Others, like Furtado, aren\u2019t sold yet on the climate change connection. Northern Illinois University meteorology professor Victor Gensini, who has already felt temperatures that seem like 25 degrees below zero, said there\u2019s \u201ca growing body of literature\u201d to support the climate connection. But he says more evidence is needed. \u201cEither way,\u201d Gensini said, \u201cit\u2019s going to be interesting being in the bullseye of the Midwest cold.\u201d ___ Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears . ___ This Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

The results of the study, which appeared in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, offer a cautionary note to dieters who may be limiting their food variety - such as by cutting out carbs - to be watchful of all calories coming in, not just those from the targeted food group. Previous studies have shown that people with less variety in their diets tend to be more successful in losing weight and keeping it off, and Raynor said she wanted to see if restricting options for high-calorie, low-nutrition foods, such as ice cream, cookies and chips, could help people lose weight. Raynor\u2019s team asked 200 overweight and obese adults to make lifestyle changes aimed at losing weight. These included taking part in group meetings that discussed healthy behavior, eating a calorie-reduced diet and increasing physical activity. Half of the people were also told to limit the junk food in their diet to just two options with the idea that monotony in the menu leads to a lack of interest in the food. Over the 18 months of the study, people in the limited junk food group ate fewer types of treats each day - two to three - than the other group, which ate about four. They also ate fewer daily calories from junk food. At six and 12 months into the study, the people in the low-variety group ate about 100 fewer junk food calories each day than the other group. By the end of the study, they were eating 80 fewer junk food calories each day. Both groups ate less total calories over the course of the study, and lost weight. But the overall reduction in calories and weight loss - around 4.5 kilograms (10 lbs.) - was the same in each group. \u201cIt makes sense to try and reduce the amount of variety in the diet, but human beings enjoy eating, so they will find other food components to consume than the ones that are being limited,\u201d said Alexandra Johnstone, a researcher at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, who was not involved in the research. She added that to make a limited variety diet work, it will be important to also limit the portion sizes. Raynor said that the message to dieters is that if they are trying to lose weight by restricting the variety in their food choices, they should be aware of their other food choices so it doesn't undermine their efforts.

Nothing made sense back then, but Theo absorbed what he saw on websites like a religion. All he could focus on was how the exterior he was born with \u2014 that of a girl \u2014 didn\u2019t look or feel right. That was six years ago, when he had another name and a different gender. Back then, Theo felt that his body was rebelling in disturbing ways. He developed breasts and got his period. He felt like a boy, but every month, the cramps reminded him of reality. He became a child at war with his body. He wasn\u2019t aware of words like gender dysphoria or transgender; those would come later. So would the national debates, the furor over bathrooms, and discussions of how to help children who didn\u2019t feel right in their own skin. \u201cWhen you\u2019re 10 years old, you really shouldn\u2019t be worried about who you are,\u201d Theo would say years later, in a moment of reflection. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be having that existential question when you\u2019re in fifth grade. You should be worried about homework and the fifth-grade dance coming up.\u201d He knew he was different from other kids in class. One day in the girls\u2019 bathroom at his South Florida elementary school, Theo made the first of many gouges in his arm, using a paperclip. Pricks of blood bloomed on his fair skin. A teacher and a school nurse whisked Theo to safety. Theo\u2019s mother, Lori Ramos, got the call from the principal. Her child was in the hospital. Ramos burst into the ER: Was it a fall, a fight, a shooting? \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d Ramos demanded of doctors and school staff. The answers were confusing: Her child had asked a teacher to call her by a different name, use different pronouns. Her child didn\u2019t feel normal and wanted to be a boy. Ramos was bewildered \u2014 she saw no prior clues her child felt this way. And she was no stranger to transgender, gay, lesbian and bisexual issues \u2014 she worked in a clinic for HIV patients. When she\u2019d given birth in 2001, in a hot tub on the family\u2019s back porch in a Florida suburb an hour south of glitzy Miami Beach, she was thrilled. \u201cI had my older son, and I had my girl, and my family was complete,\u201d Ramos said. Her baby. Her \u201csunshine girl.\u201d One who was no longer filled with light. Theo was involuntarily committed for 72 hours so doctors could determine whether he was a danger to himself or others. Soon, therapists and doctors had a diagnosis: gender dysphoria, a conflict between a person\u2019s physical or assigned gender and the gender with which they identify. But a diagnosis didn\u2019t solve Theo\u2019s problems or make him feel better. When he tried to look like a boy, everyone at school noticed. His mother was accepting; his father wasn\u2019t. He threatened to disown Theo. Theo again turned to the internet. He started cutting around his thighs and hips \u2014 his \u201cproblem areas.\u201d When Theo saw thin kids online, he looked at his own baby fat and, once again, didn\u2019t fit in. He wouldn\u2019t eat for days, or he\u2019d force himself to throw up. Cutting and vomiting weren\u2019t painful, not exactly. They were more of a stress release, a way to match physical pain to what he felt inside: \u201cI just know that it isn\u2019t right, that the body I have isn\u2019t supposed to be this way.\u201d Small aggressions at school led to outright bullying. Other kids asked what was in Theo\u2019s pants, if he had a penis, if he could show them. Theo started missing school. A therapist diagnosed depression and anxiety disorder. If only Theo could become a boy through hormone therapy \u2014 that, he thought, would solve his problems. \u201cIt\u2019s just like every time I\u2019m misgendered it feels like a wrench clamping around my heart and it slowly grows tighter and tighter,\u201d he explained. \u201cBeing addressed as female or identifying as female never felt right to me; it always gave me this acute sense of discomfort and pain.\u201d Hormone therapy for transgender children is a recent, controversial practice. It hasn\u2019t been studied much. The concept that children can be transgender has been discussed in the open only recently; previously, it was something to be hidden, squashed and ignored. About 150,000 teenagers in the U.S. identify as transgender, according to a 2017 study by the Williams Institute at UCLA\u2019s School of Law. About 1.4 million U.S. adults identify as transgender. Medical professionals have come up with protocols for children and teens. They recommend that some kids with gender dysphoria essentially pause puberty with hormone blockers until they\u2019re certain they want to live as a different gender. But the child must be prepubescent. It was too late when Theo and his parents learned about the option. Theo could take testosterone, but rigorous counseling sessions were recommended first. This annoyed Theo: Why not become a boy right away? Experts say impatience is common: Transgender children want to transition, and waiting is frustrating. Even under regular circumstances, teens and patience aren\u2019t usually mentioned in the same sentence. Doctors say going slow when treating trans teens is essential for physical and emotional well-being, and note that if a teen\u2019s feelings last until age 16, the desires are probably permanent. Theo insisted testosterone could bring peace with his body: \u201cIf I could just start T therapy, I would know I was on the way to being who I\u2019m supposed to be.\u201d His parents, though, worried about the effects on their growing child. Theo wanted testosterone, but his anxiety sometimes made him question his desires. It became a regular topic of conversation between mother and son. \u201cI\u2019m nervous,\u201d Theo said in the spring of 2016. He was 14. \u201cWhat if I do change my mind?\u201d \u201cWell, what if you do?\u201d asked his mother. \u201cI can always stop,\u201d Theo said. Ramos shook her head. \u201cThe changes are permanent.\u201d ____ EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: The Associated Press followed Theo Ramos for more than a year as he grappled with his gender dysphoria.

Roy Cooper eased pandemic restrictions on retail stores before doing so for churches -- a move that prompted pushback from some members of the faith community. Non-essential stores and indoor church services were both initially forbidden to operate under Cooper\u2019s stay-at-home order. When Cooper launched Phase One of reopening North Carolina, he allowed some stores to open but didn\u2019t allow churches to hold services indoors. Experts generally agree that traditional church customs such as singing, passing around bulletins and even sharing food would make worship services especially dangerous during the coronavirus outbreak. But Cooper\u2019s critics argued for a chance to worship while being responsible. During a press conference on May 12, Cooper said his decision was based on science. \"\"We know that inside it is much more likely that you\u2019re going to transmit this virus, particularly when you\u2019re sitting or standing in one place for a long period of time, and this is across the board. And some people are trying to compare this with retail. With retail, people are moving around and you don\u2019t have as much a chance to spread the virus (as you do) when people are sitting or standing indoors.\"\" Since then, a judge\u2019s ruling has enabled indoor church services in North Carolina. A US District Court Judge allowed for a restraining order on Cooper\u2019s rules, and Cooper said he won\u2019t appeal. Still, we wondered which is more dangerous: sitting in a building with the same group of people for a prolonged period, or walking around a building with an ever-changing group of people? The answer isn\u2019t simple. Is it possible that a church could practice social distancing well enough to prevent virus spread? Yes. Is it also possible that one shopper could linger too long around another shopper who\u2019s infected? Also yes. Because of those variables, the country\u2019s top health organizations told us they haven\u2019t compared the two environments enough to say whether one is more dangerous than another. However, experts do believe that sitting in one place for a long time does pose a threat -- while shopping usually allows people the physical freedom to avoid someone who might be infected. For this fact check, we reached out to the World Health Organization, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is directed by Dr. Anthony Fauci. None of the groups offered specifics on which scenario is more dangerous. The WHO doesn\u2019t categorize activities by risk because each scenario \"\"depends on a range of factors, from the local transmission scenario that is occurring, to prevention measures adopted by individuals to the IPC procedures in place in these public spaces,\"\" said Ashley Baldwin, a regional spokeswoman. Fauci\u2019s group responded similarly: \"\"I\u2019m not aware that this is anything our researchers have explored,\"\" NIAID spokesman Ken Pekoc said. The CDC hasn\u2019t compared them either, CDC spokeswoman Kate Grusich said. \"\"CDC has not compared locations or settings for COVID-19 transmission, so we can\u2019t comment on these questions at this time,\"\" she said. But the CDC does emphasize the risk of time spent around other people in close proximity. Kelly Haight Connor, communications manager for North Carolina\u2019s health department, responded to PolitiFact questions on Cooper\u2019s behalf. She pointed out several instances where the CDC warns against large gatherings of people. The CDC\u2019s webpage on social distancing says \"\"COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact (within about 6 feet) for a prolonged period.\"\" The CDC, which acknowledges the \"\"risk of gatherings,\"\" also offers guidance for churches hoping to hold services during the pandemic. Recommendations include: scheduling multiple services, with enough time between each to allow for cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces, promoting social distancing, limiting the sharing of materials, considering holding services and gatherings in a large, well-ventilated area or outdoors. The novel coronavirus travels through respiratory droplets expelled when someone coughs, sneezes or talks. Without definitive studies comparing the likelihood of spread in two environments, we turned to experts for their opinion. Karen Hoffmann, the immediate past president of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, told PolitiFact that the ability to walk away from someone is key. And if you do pass someone in an aisle at Target, experts believe you\u2019re less at risk than someone sitting still in a confined space. \"\"I would not worry about walking by someone,\"\" Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins University, told Slate. \"\"Even in a health care setting, contact is defined by being near someone for a certain amount of time,\"\" Adalja said. \"\"I would not worry about these fleeting encounters. The virus isn\u2019t airborne\u2014droplets need to get from one person to another.\"\" Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University, told us she generally agrees. \"\"Reports from indoor spaces (restaurants, offices) suggest that both physical proximity and duration of exposure are important for transmission,\"\" Rasmussen said in an email. \"\"So sitting still around others in close physical proximity is probably higher risk than incidentally passing by someone in a store, but the risks aren\u2019t quantified because there are a lot of variables that can impact this.\"\" A recent NPR article categorized 14 different activities by their level of risk for infection. Worship services? \"\"High risk.\"\" Going shopping? \"\"Risk varies.\"\" \"\"Crowds with high density lead to substantial increase in risk,\"\" said Dr. William Miller, an epidemiologist at Ohio State University. \"\"The major mitigating factor is that people don't mingle in a single place for long.\"\" While churches may be able to mitigate coronavirus spread, there are multiple examples of churches failing to take precautions -- and thus becoming the source of small outbreaks. A church revival in Hopkins County, Kentucky was linked to at least 30 cases and three deaths, according to The Courier Journal. Officials in California connected 71 cases to one church in a suburb of Sacramento, The Guardian reported. The Washington Post recently listed several examples in a story about the dangers of worship during the pandemic. On its Facebook page, the CDC on May 19 used a rural Arkansas church as an example of how fast coronavirus can spread in group settings. The CDC reported that two people with coronavirus symptoms attended the church in early March. \"\"Of the 92 church members who attended the gatherings, 35 were later confirmed to have COVID-19, which led to three deaths. Through contact tracing, an additional 26 confirmed cases were identified in the community,\"\" the CDC\u2019s Facebook post says. \"\"This outbreak highlights the potential for widespread transmission of COVID-19 during in-person, faith-based events.\"\" The CDC posted a report on the Arkansas outbreak on its website. Cooper said shopping isn\u2019t as likely to spread coronavirus as church services because \"\"people are moving around and you don\u2019t have as much a chance to spread the virus (as you do) when people are sitting or standing indoors.\"\" The world\u2019s leading health organizations have not offered a risk comparison between shopping and attending a worship service in part because there are so many variables. However, generally speaking, experts are definitely less worried about spaces where people can move freely than they are about spaces where people sit near each other for long periods of time.\"", "output": "\u201cWith retail, people are moving around and you don\u2019t have as much a chance to spread the virus (as you do) when people are sitting or standing indoors\u201d for long periods of time.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "\u201cPeople call me and say, \u2018I was on my terrace having lunch and we had to rush inside, the kids were in the swimming pool,\u2019\u201d says the Bordeaux vineyard worker who turned anti-pesticide campaigner after her brother died from liver cancer, a death she suspects was linked to agro-chemicals he sprayed as a wine-industry worker.

She calls the tractors that rumble amid the vines \u201cmosquitoes,\u201d because of their long arms pockmarked with nozzles that spray chemical mists to keep the plants and their valuable grapes healthy and pest-free. \u201cI close all the windows and all the doors. I bring the washing in. I put the kids\u2019 games away,\u201d Despreaux said in a phone interview, as one of her four young charges, ranging in age from 6 months to 2 \u00bd years, mewed in the background. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible.\u201d The government this week opened a three-week window of public consultation about its planned regulations that will take effect Jan. 1. It is proposing that crops treated with \u201cthe most dangerous substances\u201d be separated from homes, schools and other workplaces by no-spray zones at least 10 meters (33 feet) across. For other chemicals, there would also be 10-meter zones around high-growing crops, including vines and fruit orchards, and five meters across for cereals and other shorter crops. The buffers could be shrunk further, to three meters for vineyards and short crops and five meters for tall crops, if farmers use cutting-edge spraying techniques, the government says. It invited public comment online, and said the distances could be modified as a result. A final government decision on their size is due by December. While some environmental campaigners welcome the zones\u2019 introduction, many said the proposed distances were ridiculously small. \u201cIt\u2019s to give the impression that something is being done,\u201d Bibeyran said. \u201cThey won\u2019t protect anybody.\u201d She spent 14 years working for a Listrac vineyard that sprayed with industrial chemicals, watching with growing alarm as flora and fauna disappeared. She now works in a vineyard in Margaux that farms organically, proudly declaring: \u201cWe have loads of insects.\u201d \u201cThe difference over 14 years was stunning,\u201d she said. \u201cIt became rare to see a rabbit cross the vineyards or to see swallows.\u201d Agricultural groups complain the proposed buffers unfairly target farmers for using perfectly legal products. Some warned zoning will backfire, with insects and diseases preying on crops\u2019 untreated edges. Jean-Marie Fabre, president of the Independent Winemakers of France, said no-spray zones risked becoming \u201csources of contamination that will spread diseases to the rest of the vineyard.\u201d \u201cIt would be the same as putting someone with the plague among people who have been vaccinated,\u201d he said. The policy could force farmers to rip out untreated vines and other crops, shrinking planted acreages and hurting their bottom-line, Fabre said. If the zones contaminate treatable areas, farmers may have to spray more than they do now, he added. Urban creep into agricultural areas has exacerbated the conflict between farmers and their neighbors. Around Bordeaux, for example, families seeking space have moved in droves onto what used to be farmed lands, building homes amid vineyards. Despreaux and her husband moved from Paris in 2002. She says they were unaware they\u2019d be living cheek-by-jowl with farmers who spray. \u201cWe were na\u00efve,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we had known there\u2019d be these risks, we would never have come here. I regret it.\u201d Although agro-chemicals are officially certified, she doesn\u2019t believe they\u2019re safe and doesn\u2019t trust government officials to stand up to the influence of agricultural lobbies. Tractors spray vines behind her house every two weeks, and sometimes every week, from April when the grapes form to September when they\u2019re harvested, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating because the best period of the year, when it\u2019s nice outside, is when we have to stay inside,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t walk in the vines with the kids because it\u2019s not possible. It puts them in danger. We live in the countryside but we don\u2019t have the advantages of living in the countryside.\u201d Fabre said the onus should be on property developers to set up buffer zones around new buildings. \u201cThe farmers didn\u2019t move closer to houses, the houses moved closer to them,\u201d he said. He fears the consultation launched Monday will stoke public concerns about chemicals he insists are risk-free if correctly used, giving voice to \u201cdisinformation and even demagogy that will trump science.\u201d Despreaux said she\u2019s braced for a long battle. Campaigning with Bibeyran and others in a region where wine-producing chateaux underpin local economies and jobs, she says she\u2019s treated \u201cas a tree-hugger and a bit mad.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not understood,\u201d she said. \u201cThe chateaux have so much power.

Ulster County took the extra step of mandating the measles vaccine or proof of immunity at all day camps and overnight camps, becoming the latest county in the area to issue immunization requirements. Rockland County announced a similar order this month, following mandates from Sullivan and Orange counties. \u201cWe have to make sure our t\u2019s are crossed and our i\u2019s are dotted in making sure all these vaccination records are in and have been fine-combed through to make sure everything is in compliance,\u201d said Rabbi Hanoch Hecht, of Ulster County\u2019s Camp Emunah, which hosts many girls from a Chabad community in Brooklyn\u2019s Crown Heights. \u201cIn the past where we accepted religious exemptions for certain things,\u201d said Hecht, who is getting his own blood checked for immunity, \u201cnow we cannot.\u201d The state of New York requires summer camps to keep immunization records for all campers, but doesn\u2019t bar children from attending if they haven\u2019t gotten a measles shot. Children are required to get the measles vaccine to attend schools in New York, however, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed legislation Thursday eliminating an exemption for kids whose parents object to vaccinations on religious grounds. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that, as of June 1, more than 1,000 measles cases had been reported in the U.S. since the start of the year, up from fewer than 100 cases a year a decade ago. The bulk of those cases have been diagnosed in ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods in Brooklyn and suburban Rockland County. The CDC recommends everyone over a year old should get the vaccine, except for people who had the disease as children. Those who have had measles are immune. The vaccine, which became available in the 1960s, is considered safe and highly effective \u2014 paving the way for measles to be declared all but eliminated in the U.S. in 2000. But it has had a resurgence several times, including 667 cases in 2014. Hecht and others stressed that vaccinations are widely accepted by most members of the Orthodox community, echoing rabbis in Brooklyn and Rockland County who say it is a relatively small group of parents influenced by anti-vaccination propaganda \u2014 not religious teachings \u2014 who have resisted inoculations. The Orthodox Union said it has previously required up-to-date vaccinations, including the MMR vaccine, for its 37 summer programs. \u201cMost of the leaders and rabbis have taken the approach that vaccination is required,\u201d Hecht said. Health officials in New York City have taken a tough approach, making measles vaccinations mandatory for everyone living in the Brooklyn neighborhood that is the epicenter of the outbreak, fining people for failing to get inoculated and closing 12 schools for failing to exclude staff and students who couldn\u2019t document immunity. The city announced the two most recent closures Thursday. Now, as schools prepare to close down for the summer, the fight is spreading into the Catskills and Hudson River Valley. Sullivan County is in the heart of the traditional Borscht Belt, and the lake-laden area still attracts thousands to its camps and bungalow colonies each summer. Of the 170 state-regulated camps in the county, 139 are Orthodox Jewish camps. \u201cWe draw such a population from New York City, where this measles outbreak was,\u201d Sullivan County spokesman Dan Hust said. \u201cIt was considered prudent and wise.\u201d Not everyone agrees. The orders from Sullivan and Orange counties were challenged in state courts by parents of various religious faiths. However, civil rights attorney Michael Sussman said Friday he believes those cases will have to be withdrawn given New York\u2019s removal of religious exemptions. Several camp administrators interviewed by The Associated Press expressed no objection to mandatory vaccinations. \u201cWe have no issue with that,\u201d said Yoel Landau, director at Camp Rav Tov, a camp for Hasidic boys in Monticello. Landau said schoolboys from New York City attending the camp should have already been vaccinated because of the city\u2019s order in April. Rabbi Dovid Teichman, director of Camp Govoah, which caters to Orthodox campers in rural Greene County, said staffers were \u201ccombing through each and every application to make sure that everyone is vaccinated.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t jeopardize anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if I find somebody that\u2019s on the list that\u2019s not vaccinating, I\u2019m not taking them into camp.\u201d", "output": "Summer camp is newest front in battle with measles outbreak.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "In late June and early July 2020, Snopes readers asked whether Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s foremost immunologist, had stated that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was told to cancel funding for research into how coronavirus infections emerge in humans.

The testimony came as the U.S. experienced a spike in reported COVID-19 cases.

In a separate vote, parliament also decided to allow parents of children suffering serious diseases to use in-vitro fertilisation to select \u201csavior siblings\u201d who can act as donors for transplants to save their sick brothers and sisters. Parliament defeated an amendment to ban inter-species research \u2014 in which human DNA is injected into cells derived from animals \u2014 by 336 to 176 after hours of impassioned debate on ethics versus science. The vote means Britain retains its status as a world leader in stem cell research. Human-animal embryo research is banned in some countries including Australia, France, Germany and Italy. Prime Minister Gordon Brown supports the creation of human-animal or \u201cadmixed\u201d embryos but some Roman Catholic members of his government oppose the research. Brown allowed members of parliament to vote by conscience rather than on party lines. \u201cIf we want to sustain stem cell research and bring new cures and treatments to millions of people, I believe admixed embryos are necessary,\u201d Brown argued in a newspaper article. The human fertilisation and embryology bill prohibits the transfer of the embryos to a human or animal and says they cannot be used for research beyond 14 days. The bill, which updates 1990 laws, is at committee stage when amendments are tabled and will be subject to a final vote in coming weeks. Two groups of scientists have already been given permission to create human-animal admixed embryos. The bill legalizes their research within set guidelines. Some researchers say allowing admixed embryos would open more avenues as they seek cures for conditions like motor neuron disease or Parkinson\u2019s. They say their creation would help ease a deficit of donated human eggs for stem cell research. But other scientists and religious leaders say that creating human-animal embryos is unethical, and using them for research is a blind alley that won\u2019t cure disease. One Catholic cardinal called the research \u201cFrankenstein science\u201d. David King, director of the campaign group Human Genetics Alert, said he feared sufferers of Alzheimer\u2019s and other diseases were being offered false hope. \u201cIt is very sad that all these patient groups have been hyped up to believe in this stuff.

Researchers at New York state\u2019s College of Environmental Science and Forestry are seeking federal clearance to distribute thousands of modified trees as part of a restoration effort \u2014 a closely-watched move that could expand the frontier for genetically engineered plants beyond farms and into forests. The precedent-setting case adds urgency to a question scientists have already been grappling with: Should genetic engineering be used in the wild to help save or restore trees? Opponents warn of starting \u201ca massive and irreversible experiment\u201d in a highly complex ecosystem. Proponents see a technology already ubiquitous in the supermarket that could help save forests besieged by invasive pests. \u201cWe have this technology, it\u2019s a very powerful technology, and we can use that now to save a species,\u201d said Professor William Powell, a molecular plant biologist who directs the American Chestnut Research and Restoration Project at the college. The researchers want the U.S. Department of Agriculture to assess an American chestnut tree with a gene from wheat that helps it tolerate cryphonectria parasitica, a fungus unwittingly imported to the United States over 100 years ago. The blight decimated a towering tree species once dominant in forests from Maine to Georgia. Nuts from up to 4 billion trees fattened hogs, and its sturdy wood was used to build cabins. Yet by the time Nat King Cole crooned about \u201cchestnuts roasting on an open fire\u201d after World War II, trees were doomed by the blight. Surviving trees today are typically shrubs sprouting from old roots, yet to be infected. Long-running efforts to breed American chestnut trees with the blight tolerance of Chinese chestnut trees are more complicated than once appreciated. That\u2019s because the Chinese tree\u2019s tolerance comes from a suite of genes, instead of one or two. Powell and his research partner Charles Maynard began working on a complementary track decades ago at the request of the New York chapter of the American Chestnut Foundation. The added wheat gene enables trees to produce an enzyme that breaks down harmful acid released by the fungus. Right now, the trees are tightly regulated. Modified trees grow behind the fence of the college\u2019s experiment station near trees without the added gene. Researchers breed the two types of trees for genetic diversity. But flowering branch tips are covered with bags that keep pollen from blowing away. Chestnuts grow and are harvested in the same bags. About half the chestnuts will inherit the gene, the researchers say. The researchers want the USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to evaluate the risks of the modified tree and to lift the current regulations. Researchers say they recently sent in their filing, though it needs to be reviewed for completeness before the agency begins its formal assessment. \u201cWhat we have to make clear is that it\u2019s not going to be any different than the trees produced through conventional means,\u201d Powell said. The USDA commonly authorizes genetically engineered crops. The vast majority of commercial corn and soybean acreage in the United States is used to grow crops engineered to be tolerant to herbicides or insects. There are even some genetically engineered plantation trees, such as papayas resistant to ringspot virus. But engineered trees are not intentionally planted in the forests for conservation. That could change as genetic manipulation becomes more common and trees are increasingly threatened by climate change and invasive pests. \u201cIf the chestnut is approved ... I think it\u2019s accurate to say that it does help pave the way for other biotech trees,\u201d said Jason Delborne, an associate professor of science, policy and society at North Carolina State University. Delborne served on a National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine committee that this year released a report that said biotechnology has a potential to help protect forests but recommended more study and investment. Some scientists are concerned about the long-term effects of a re-introducing a tree into the woods that can live for more than 200 years. How will the new trees interact with the species that replaced the long-gone chestnuts? What if the trees die off again in 50 years? Forest eco-systems are incredibly complex and the current regulatory framework is not up to the task of evaluating the environmental and societal risks, said biotechnology and sustainable agriculture expert Doug Gurian-Sherman. \u201cI think we have to step back and ask whether our ability to manipulate things is getting ahead of our ability to understand their impacts,\u201d said Gurian-Sherman, a former senior scientist for the Union of Concerned Scientists. Rachel Smolker, a co-director of the advocacy group Biofuelwatch and co-author of a report critical of the tree\u2019s release, is concerned that the chestnut tree \u2014 with its cozy public image \u2014 could be a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d for other trees engineered for commercial use instead of conservation. Many scientists see biotech as a promising tool left on the shelf, partly due to opposition they say is grounded more in emotion than science. Meanwhile, trees are dying from scourges such as the emerald ash borer and the spotted lantern fly, and some scientists say biotech could help where other efforts have failed. \u201cCompared to what\u2019s happening in the world with pests and climate change, I think the risks of making a mistake due to tweaking a gene wrong are so small compared to the risks of doing nothing,\u201d said Steven Strauss, a forest biotechnologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis. Strauss is prominent in efforts to overturn biotech tree bans on certified commercial forest land. If the application clears the USDA, the tree still needs to be considered by the Food and Drug Administration and it may need to be reviewed by the Environmental Protection Agency. Powell believes the review could take two to four years. A green light from the government would clear the way for distribution of the genetically engineered seedlings, pollen, or scions for grafting to volunteers around the chestnut\u2019s traditional range. In rural upstate New York, Allen Nichols is waiting. Nichols, president of the New York chapter of the American Chestnut Foundation, has about 100 chestnut trees on a rise by his house. Thanks to his diligent care, some lived long enough to produce chestnuts this year. Other trees are dying while others sprout anew \u2014 a steady cycle of life, blight and renewal in a rural orchard. The 69-year-old -retiree looks forward to the day he can graft the genetically engineered tree onto his stock, letting the pollen drift in the wind and bringing back a healthy tree his parents talked fondly about. \u201cIf we can do it, we should do it,\u201d Nichols said as he surveyed his trees. \u201cWe owe it to the forest to try to correct some of the damage that we\u2019ve done.\u201d ___ Follow Michael Hill on Twitter: @MichaelTHill", "output": "High-tech chestnuts: US to consider genetically altered tree.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "It is not the first time drugmakers have clashed with Pretoria. A decade ago the industry was forced to climb down in a bruising battle with South Africa over AIDS drugs patents and access to generics. The latest fight reflects tension between an industry that wants to protect its intellectual property, even as it pushes further into emerging markets, and governments from India to Brazil that are determined to increase patients\u2019 access to life-saving treatments. South Africa is in the final stages of implementing a new law that would allow generic drugmakers to produce cut-price copies of patented medicines and make it harder for firms to register and roll over patents. Global drugmakers have drawn up a $600,000 publicity campaign to mobilize local and overseas opposition to the intellectual property (IP) changes, according to a document written by a drugs industry lobby group and seen by Reuters. Minister of Health Aaron Motsoaledi on Friday lashed out at drugmakers, saying their campaign was aimed at turning South Africans against the government. \u201cIt\u2019s a conspiracy of satanic magnitude,\u201d he said. \u201cThis document can sentence many South Africans to death. This is a plan for genocide.\u201d  The ruling African National Congress is looking to cut healthcare costs as it grapples with the world\u2019s heaviest HIV/AIDS caseloads and its biggest treatment program. The new law is expected to reduce medicine prices and open up a fledgling generic drug industry dominated by Aspen Pharmacare and Adcock Ingram. The policy would also close a loophole known as \u201cever-greening\u201d that allows a drugmaker to make minor changes to an existing drug or discover a new use for it, and then register it as a totally new find. Healthcare activists say South Africa\u2019s track record of approving drug patents - in 2008 it granted more than 2,400 patents compared with fewer than 300 in six years in Brazil - shows the need for reform. The document - prepared by U.S. consultancy Public Affairs Engagement for industry lobby Innovative Pharmaceutical Association South Africa (IPASA) - outlines a plan to delay the reform at least until after South Africa\u2019s elections in early May by suggesting the new law would be politically damaging. \u201cThe world cares that South Africa is proposing to take a wrong turn in economic policy by weakening IP protections.

Even as work on Oregon State University\u2019s Marine Studies Building was underway in Newport, the Legislature went a step further and repealed a ban on construction of new \u201ccritical facilities\u201d in tsunami inundation zones, allowing fire stations, police stations and schools to be built in the potential path of a tsunami. Passage of the bill in June was little noticed during one of the most tumultuous legislative sessions in Oregon history. But it has since been roundly criticized \u2014 including by Gov. Kate Brown, who told journalists the bill\u2019s passage was one of her disappointments, even though she signed the measure and previously said it benefited economic development. Chris Goldfinger, an Oregon State University professor and an earthquake geologist, says putting the $60 million oceanography building in the path of a tsunami is \u201cbeyond ironic,\u201d and allowing even more construction threatens lives in favor of development. \u201cIt\u2019s foolhardy. In every other country in the world, best practice for tsunamis is avoidance, not building in a tsunami zone,\u201d Goldfinger said at a symposium for journalists in Newport that included a tour of the construction project. Proponents of the university facility point out that the building will withstand strong earthquakes and be higher than the biggest tsunami. It will feature a rooftop evacuation site that can accommodate more than 900 people, accessed via an exterior ramp. Two days of supplies, including water, food and first aid, will be kept on the roof, said Cinamon Moffett, research facility coordinator for the marine center. Once the water subsides, survivors would be evacuated to a community college on a nearby hill, she said. An earthquake in the Cascadia subduction zone, which extends in the ocean off Northern California to Canada\u2019s Vancouver Island, has a 37 percent probability of happening off Oregon in the next 50 years, with a slightly lower chance of one striking near Washington state, Goldfinger said. Cascadia earthquakes have an average magnitude of around 9, making them among the world\u2019s biggest. Evidence of a Cascadia earthquake\u2019s awesome destructive power is visible 30 miles (50 kilometers) up the coast from Newport. There, a \u201cghost forest\u201d of Sitka spruces juts up from a beach in the tiny town of Neskowin. An earthquake 2,000 years ago likely caused the ground beneath the trees to plunge, and tsunami debris buried them. The remnants were partially uncovered by storms in 1997. Today, the barnacle-encrusted trees stand like sentinels, facing the Pacific Ocean with vacation homes and a motel nearby. The last time the ocean reared up from a Cascadia earthquake was in 1700. The estimated magnitude 9 quake sent a tsunami across the Pacific into the coast of Japan, where it flooded farm fields, damaged fishermen\u2019s shacks and ascended a castle moat. In the Pacific Northwest and Canada, the impact was far worse, and is described in the folklore of indigenous peoples. One tale describes a struggle between a thunderbird and a whale that caused the earth to shake and the ocean to wash away people and homes. Oregon became a leader in tsunami preparedness when the Legislature, in 1995, banned construction of certain public facilities in inundation zones. Vancouver Island in Canada\u2019s British Columbia province was slammed by the 1700 tsunami. But no law prohibits construction of public buildings in tsunami zones there, according to Emergency Management BC. Washington state requires municipalities and counties to establish rules to limit development in areas that are frequently flooded or could be hit by tsunamis, landslides or other calamities. California has no state-mandated development restrictions in tsunami zones, said Rick Wilson, senior engineering geologist with the California Geological Survey. But the state recently adopted new language in its building code requiring that certain types of buildings be constructed to withstand tsunami forces, Wilson said. Other states are moving to do the same, using standards from the American Society of Civil Engineers. Japan, reacting to a 2011 earthquake and tsunami that left more than 18,000 dead or presumed dead, passed a law allowing towns to set tsunami warning zones and make evacuation and reconstruction plans. The government is spending 1 trillion yen ($9 billion) to build giant seawalls around the northern coastline. Moving to higher ground is not required, though some coastal communities have done so. \u201cOregon has gone from sort of a leader in this to full reverse,\u201d said Goldfinger, who was attending a seismology conference in Japan when the 2011 earthquake hit. Oregon lawmakers overwhelmingly repealed the 1995 construction ban in June, as tensions in the Capitol ratcheted up over Republican opposition to a bill addressing global warming. Few people attended hearings at which lawmakers from coastal districts testified in favor of the repeal. Democratic Rep. David Gomberg, one of its sponsors, told members of a House committee to imagine the impacts if the state banned new schools, parking garages and police and fire stations in their communities. \u201cWhat would be the consequence of that, to your ability to get insurance on your home, your ability to attract a new business into a neighborhood that\u2019s not safe enough for fire departments, your ability to resell your home in a neighborhood not safe enough for police departments?\u201d Gomberg asked. He said the state geology department should \u201chelp us rather than to stop ... our communities growing, thriving or continuing.\u201d Gomberg said his bill gives the department responsibility for advising where a new inundation line should be and how risks can be mitigated. He also said he will introduce legislation for Oregon to adopt the American Society of Civil Engineers\u2019 tsunami and earthquake building standards. Republican Sen. Brian Boquist, who was at the center of a Republican walkout over the global warming bill, was the only senator to vote against the repeal. Boquist said in an email that it allows public entities to build, knowing full well the buildings will not survive a tsunami. It is too soon to tell if coastal cities will use the new leeway to build facilities in inundation zones. Some have been doing the opposite. The town of Seaside, 70 miles (110 kilometers) northwest of Portland, is moving schools out of the tsunami zone. Newport Mayor Dean Sawyer said his city has no plans to build critical facilities in the inundation zone. But he praised the Marine Studies Building for its rooftop evacuation site, which can fit the population of an entire neighborhood of his fishing town. \u201cWe consider it to be a unique solution,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, the Corvallis Gazette-Times noted in an editorial that while it is possible to design a building that can survive an earthquake and tsunami, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t answer the question of why we should take the risk in the first place.\u201d The newspaper urged lawmakers to reassess the new law when they convene next year. ___ Associated Press writers Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo and Rob Gillies in Toronto contributed to this report. ___ Follow Andrew Selsky on Twitter at https://twitter.com/andrewselsky", "output": "Critics blast Oregon repeal of tsunami-zone building ban.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "Burns tackles the famed Mayo Clinic in his next film, exploring the history of the innovative Rochester, Minnesota-based hospital that has been dubbed \u201cThe Miracle in a Cornfield.\u201d It has treated luminaries such as the Dalai Lama \u2014 and Burns. The first time Burns went, he was immediately impressed by the level and detail of his medical care, like the patient was at the center, not the doctor. \u201cI began to get curious about why this was so different from any other health care experience I\u2019d had,\u201d he said. The result is the two-hour documentary \u201cThe Mayo Clinic: Faith, Hope, Science,\u201d which starts with the hospital\u2019s birth during a tornado in 1883 and ends with the modern-day Mayo, state-of-the-art facilities over several campuses that treat up to 14,000 patients in 24 hours. \u201cThe Mayo is just a quintessentially American story, just as baseball is a quintessentially American subject, as are the national parks, the Civil War,\u201d Burns said. \u201cAnd this was a story firing on all cylinders, at least as far as I felt. And it was a story that I don\u2019t think had been fully understood.\u201d The documentary \u2014 directed by Burns, Erik Ewers and Christopher Loren Ewers \u2014 features the voices of Tom Hanks, Sam Waterston and Blythe Danner, as well as familiar touches: Peter Coyote narrates, there\u2019s rousing music by Aaron Copeland and Scott Joplin, and evocative slow-scans of old photographs known as \u201cthe Ken Burns effect.\u201d The film is part of a documentary film empire Burns has on tap. Upcoming are works on the history of country music, Ernest Hemingway, Muhammad Ali, Benjamin Franklin and the American Revolution, as well as deep dives into crime and punishment in America and civil rights during President Lyndon Johnson. \u201cI\u2019m plotted out to 2030 \u2014 God and funding willing,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cAs much as I\u2019d like to believe that I pick projects, in fact I think they pick me. And they pick me because they\u2019re just quintessential American stories, whatever they might be.\u201d Burns has built a reputation for capturing sweeping historic moments with intimate details of peoples\u2019 lives, tackling topics ranging from the Brooklyn Bridge to baseball, from Mark Twain to jazz. His films make the past come alive: Burns was once escorted out of an Alabama church by state troopers from people still upset by the Civil War\u2019s outcome. The Mayo film begins with the unusual collaboration by Dr. W.W. Mayo \u2014 \u201ca doctor who worshipped Darwin,\u201d Burns said \u2014 and a group of Franciscan nuns who began working with Mayo to help tornado victims in 1883. The hospital adopted a salary-based model of teamwork \u2014 not based on ordering tests or a revolving door of patients \u2014 that is said to encourage innovation, time with patients and collaboration. In the film, Tom Brokaw and John McCain endorse its methods. So does co-director Erik Ewers, who started the project not as a Mayo patient but ended up one. He had been suffering from intestinal problems for 20 years and had been given seven different diagnoses without finding relief. While he was filming the Mayo documentary, its doctors reached out. \u201cThey diagnosed it in two days,\u201d Ewers said. Burns calls Mayo\u2019s formula a \u201csecret sauce\u201d \u2014 one that also manages to have poor patients get free care \u2014 and hopes it can offer answers to America\u2019s health care problems. \u201cWe were making a film about the history the Mayo Clinic, but realized that in their story and in their example might be a way for us all to re-enter a conversation about the essential question: What do we owe each other in terms of taking care of each other?\u201d he said. Burns\u2019 inimitable visual style is sometimes mocked, but the filmmaker isn\u2019t in a rush to embrace flashy special effects, something he calls \u201call sizzle and no steak.\u201d He admits to dragging his heels on embracing digital cameras and computer editing because he simply liked splicing film stock. But that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s inflexible \u2014 he used drones in the Mayo film. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of sleek hares out there who are racing past the turtle that we are,\u201d he said. \u201cWe make long films. And if you\u2019re going to watch a long film, we have to make sure that we honor the attention you\u2019re giving to us with an equal care in the crafting of it.\u201d The work is painstaking. For the documentary on country music, he estimates his team has pored over 100,000 photographs and scanned 60,000 of them \u2014 only to use less than 3,000. \u201cI use the analogy of maple syrup: It takes 40 gallons of sap to make one gallon of maple syrup,\u201d Burns said. By delving into America\u2019s past so much, Burns has learned a lot about human nature, but he dislikes the cliche that history repeats itself. He prefers to quote Mark Twain, who said \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself but it often rhymes.\u201d His work has given him hard-won perspective. When people during the financial crisis in 2007 began evoking the Great Depression, Burns knew his history. He replied that if animals in the zoos were being shot for food, then it was an apt analogy. \u201cThat\u2019s what history can do. It\u2019s a kind of an armor or at least a thermal layer that protects you from the chill of the present moment,\u201d he said. ___ Mark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits", "output": "Ken Burns turns his attention to the Mayo Clinic.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "To start, the company said Wednesday the Kate Spade New York Foundation is giving $250,000 to the Crisis Text Line , a free, 24-hour confidential text message service for people in crisis.

In the Basque capital Vitoria, an early centre of the outbreak, a Reuters reporter witnessed the funeral of a coronavirus victim, one of the few occasions for which Spaniards are allowed to break the lockdown and leave their homes. Undertakers in white overalls and masks lowered the casket while grieving family members stood back, keeping one metre (three foot) apart to minimise the risk of infection.

The approved antiviral drugs are currently available only in pill or inhaled form. The story should have mentioned the side effects seen in clinical trials so far, as well as the risk that patients could suffer harms like those sometimes seen in people who have been given similar antiviral drugs.

People with the flu, especially children and adolescents, may be at a higher risk for seizures, confusion, or abnormal behavior early in their illness. These events may happen after starting PERAMIVIR or may happen if the flu is not treated. These events are not common. Patients should be watched for signs of unusual behavior. \u2022 Allergic reaction or severe rash Not a lot of people have taken PERAMIVIR for 5 days or longer.

The story points out that the experimental drug is being offered only to patients who are already in the hospital and aren\u2019t being helped by approved drugs. The story did not point out that one of the supporters of faster and broader access to peramivir, Dr. Richard Whitley, has long been a booster of the drug, which is being commercially developed by a spin-off of the University of Alabama department he works in. See Whitley comments in a 2005 article promoting the potential of peramivir: http://main.uab.edu/show.asp?durki=87834 Here we also point out that the story profiled only one patient and includes a quote from the patient\u2019s father crediting peramivir with saving his daughter\u2019s life. The story does not give any examples of similar patients who either survived after getting approved drugs or who received peramivir and yet did not survive.

But it found that schools can be liable if they fail to act after they become aware that a student has attempted suicide while enrolled, or shortly before entering, or learn that the student had threatened to commit suicide. Gary Pavela, a consultant on law and policy issues in higher education, said he\u2019s unaware of another state appellate court that has explicitly found that universities have a duty to prevent suicide in limited cases and defines those circumstances. \u201cThis will be very newsworthy to colleges around the country,\u201d said Pavela, who has written a book about the legal questions surrounding student suicides.

Furthermore, he was living off campus instead of a dormitory under \u201cdaily observation,\u201d the court said. But the judges said schools must take \u201creasonable measures\u201d to help students they know have attempted suicide while at the school or have threatened to kill themselves. That would include initiating a suicide prevention protocol, getting the student in the care of a medical professional, or contacting police, fire or emergency medical personnel. \u201cIt requires the school to really have a lot of information that the suicide is likely and the reasonable measures that the school needs to take are not extremely onerous,\u201d said Naomi Shatz, an attorney who\u2019s not involved in the case. A group of 18 colleges and universities \u2014 including Harvard University and Boston College \u2014 told the court that holding MIT responsible for Nguyen\u2019s death would have far-reaching consequences by causing officials with no medical expertise to overreact to concerns out of fear of liability. Nguyen\u2019s professors shared concerns about his mental health in the months leading up to his death, and one encouraged his colleagues to pass him or they might have \u201cblood on their hands.\u201d In a telephone call 11 minutes before he killed himself, a professor \u201cread him the riot act\u201d over an email Nguyen sent to another MIT official that they believed was inappropriate, court records said. The family said that the school should have known that \u201cmishandling this fragile student\u201d would result in his suicide. But MIT said the school wasn\u2019t aware of the severity of his condition, noting that he was treated by outside professionals and refused on-campus resources.

Once referred to as \u2018consumption\u2019 because of the way sufferers appear to waste away, tuberculosis has been known for centuries. The bacterium responsible for TB was discovered 136 years ago and the development of an effective antibiotic helped rich countries to largely contain the disease after World War II. Still, the U.N. health agency estimates that about 10 million people worldwide become newly infected with TB each year, mostly in poor countries where access to health care is limited. \u201cIt really is a global epidemic,\u201d said Dr. Tereza Kasaeva, who heads WHO\u2019s program to combat TB. Speaking ahead of a high-level meeting on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, Kasaeva said the U.N.\u2019s target of eradicating tuberculosis worldwide by 2030 \u201cis very ambitious given that for now progress is too slow.\u201d Like HIV, tuberculosis remains a highly stigmatized illness, preventing some sufferers from seeking treatment. Experts are particularly concerned about the rising number of people contracting drug-resistant variants of TB, many of which aren\u2019t diagnosed properly. Treating them can be costly and arduous, requiring years of medication with strong side effects. Dr. Ralf Otto-Knapp of the German Central Committee to Combat Tuberculosis, a group established in the late 19th century when the disease was still widespread in much of Europe, warned against complacency about the disease in an age of global travel. \u201cBecause of the increasing mobility in society it also affects economically more powerful countries,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need a joint political will and the necessary resources to fight tuberculosis effectively.\u201d Kasaeva said she hoped leaders attending the New York meeting Wednesday will commit to closing the growing gap between the amount of money available and the billions more required to tackle the disease. Campaigners applauded a recent decision by the World Health Organization to recommend a change in the way drug-resistant tuberculosis is treated, prioritizing oral drugs over injectable medication. The group Doctors Without Borders said such treatment can reduce debilitating side effects, help improve cure rates and cut the number of deaths, but noted that it requires U.S. pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson, which makes the key drug bedaquiline, to reduce its price in low- and middle-income countries with high rates of drug-resistant TB. The company has already sharply reduced costs for the drug in some countries, but in others a six-month course of treatment can cost several thousand dollars \u2014 far more than most people can afford.

However, some expressed skepticism about the story, claiming that Rose was a crisis actor, and that the circumstances of his death, and his earlier social media posts, amounted to a hoax. But the posts and obituary were authentic. Richard Donald Rose III, known as Rick, died on July 4 after suffering complications from COVID-19, with which he was diagnosed three days earlier. Two months earlier, he had indeed vowed not to wear a face mask, dismissing their use as \u201chype.\u201d Three weeks before his passing, Rose did visit a holiday resort in Ohio, posting a photograph of a crowded swimming pool area there. Rose\u2019s obituary, which was published on the Legacy.com website, in the Sandusky Register, the Port Clinton Beacon, and on the website of Crosser and Priesman funeral home, stated the following: \u201cRichard Donald Rose, III, 37, of Port Clinton passed away Saturday, July 4, 2020 due to complications of Covid-19 at his home. He was born July 25, 1982 in Port Clinton. He graduated from Port Clinton High School. He served his country in the United States Army for nine years serving two tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. He enjoyed social media, online streaming, paranormal and his two cats Dale and Tucker. He was a fan of NASCAR, Dirt Track Racing and Georgia Bulldogs Football. Surviving are his mother and step-father: Tina and Kenny Heschel of Port Clinton; sister: Krystal Campbell of Genoa; brother: K. C. Heschel of Concord, NC; half-sister: Melissa Rose of Port Clinton. He was preceded in death by his grandparents: Carl and Marla Kessler, Cooper and Janice Heschel, Richard Rose, Mildred DeBlase\u2026\u201d In the months leading up to his death, Rose posted to Facebook several observations regarding COVID-19, but the tone of the posts was not consistent throughout. In general, much of what Rose posted on the site was humorous, and some of his COVID-19-related posts kept the spirit of lightheartedness and mischievousness.

Claiming that mail-in voting favors Democrats, he said: \u201cNow they need that money in order to make the post office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots\u2026 Now, if we don\u2019t make a deal, that means they don\u2019t get the money. That means they can\u2019t have universal mail-in voting, they just can\u2019t have it.\u201dIt was fairly easy to determine the veracity of the quote; myriad news outlets in the United States and abroad covered the interview between Trump and Bartiromo on August 13 2020. A clip of the comments also circulated on Twitter:Trump this morning why he won\u2019t fund US Postal Service. \u201cNow they need that money in order to make the post office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots \u2026 But if they don\u2019t get those two items that means you can\u2019t have universal mail-in voting.\u201d pic.twitter.com/73NBmSnoNC\u2014 The Recount (@therecount) August 13, 2020That video clip started with Trump saying \u201cthey want,\u201d with no previous context about the \u201cthey\u201d he referenced.

They had levels of voting, that if you ever agreed to it you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again.\"\" pic.twitter.com/x5HmX6uogo\u2014 Lis Power (@LisPower1) March 30, 2020With respect to the August 13 2020 Bartiromo interview on Fox Business, most clips and transcripts started with \u201cthey,\u201d making it not entirely clear which \u201cthey\u201d Trump referenced. However, Slate published a partial transcript of the portion of the video about USPS funding and mail-in voting. Bartiromo asked what specifically Democrats were seeking that was \u201ccausing a breakdown in any deals\u201d:Bartiromo: What specifically are they pushing for that is causing a breakdown in any deals? Nancy Pelosi said that the Democrats and the White House are still miles apart on any stimulus.Trump responded, indicating \u201cthey\u201d were congressional Democrats:Trump: Well they\u2019re right. And it\u2019s their fault. They want $3.5 billion for something that\u2019ll turn out to be fraudulent. That\u2019s election money, basically. They want $3.5 billion for the mail-in votes. Universal mail-in ballots. They want $25 billion\u2014billion\u2014for the post office. Now they need that money in order to have post office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots. Now, in the meantime, they aren\u2019t getting there. By the way, those are just two items. But if you don\u2019t get those two items, that means you can\u2019t have universal mail-in voting. Because they\u2019re not equipped to have it. And you see how bad it\u2019s been with this Carolyn Maloney scam. She scammed her way into an election she probably lost. But they said mail-in ballots, its all mixed up. Paterson, New Jersey, same thing. Yesterday Virginia, 500,000 applications for ballots got sent to everybody, nobody even knows. Got sent to dogs. Got sent to dead people. Nobody has no idea what happened. They said, Oh we made a mistake, I\u2019m sorry. Five hundred thousand ballots sent in Virginia. How do you feel about Virginia going in there when you have 500,000 phony ballot applicants? And this is all over.Bartiromo asked about whether quibbling over USPS funding and infrastructure for mail-in voting was \u201cholding up money for the American people,\u201d referring to stimulus payments during the COVID-19 pandemic. In his second response, Trump confirmed that funding for mail-in voting was at issue in broader negotiations:Bartiromo: This is what\u2019s holding up money for the American people? They want mail-in voting and they want money for the post office? This is one of the sticking points that\u2019s holding back stimulus for Americans during this coronavirus?Trump: That\u2019s one of them. [Cross talk]Trump: That\u2019s one of them. That\u2019s right. Maria, how would you like to have $3.5 billion for mail-in voting. Billion! You know how much that is? Nobody has any idea, you people, Oh, you know, 3\u00bd billion. They want $25 billion for the post office, because the post office is going to have to go to town to get these ridiculous ballots in. You know, there\u2019s nothing wrong with getting out and voting. They voted during World War I and World War II. And they should have voter ID, because the Democrats scam the system. But two of the items are the post office, and $3.5 billion dollars for mail-in voting. Now, if we don\u2019t make a deal, that means they don\u2019t get the money. That means they can\u2019t have universal mail-in voting. They just can\u2019t have it. So, you know.As such, the comments Heather Cox Richardson shared were accurate; Trump said Democrats sought money in order to have the post office functioning \u201cso it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots,\u201d and \u201cif we don\u2019t make a deal, that means they don\u2019t get the money,\u201d and \u201cthey can\u2019t have universal mail-in voting \u2026 they just can\u2019t have it.\u201d The commentary occurred across exchanges with Bartiromo, in the same short section of an interview on Fox Business.

At least two House members and their staffs received vaccinations, and one representative who often takes her 9-month-old to work called her pediatrician to check what precautions she should take. The whooping cough case is being held up as a warning in the Texas House, where politically active vaccination opponents have tried to claim territory. \u201cI know it\u2019s on people\u2019s minds,\u201d said state Rep.

A bill in New York would let minors get vaccinated without parental consent, while a California proposal would give state health officials \u2014 instead of local doctors \u2014 the power to decide which children can skip vaccinations before attending school. Whooping cough is a bacterial infection also known as pertussis that often starts with what feels like a mild cold, followed by weeks of intense coughing fits. The disease gets its name from the sound some people make at the end of a coughing jag when they gasp for breath. There are about 10,000 to 40,000 cases of pertussis reported each year, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control. Forty-seven people in the Texas Capitol received pertussis vaccinations supplied by state health officials Monday and Tuesday, said Lara Anton, a spokeswoman with the Texas Department of State Health Services. She said she could not disclose any details about the person who contracted whooping cough, citing privacy, but House pages are typically children around middle-school age. \u201cIt was a large number of people who were potentially exposed,\u201d Anton said. In Texas, the number of schoolchildren claiming vaccine exemptions has surged from about 2,300 students in 2003 to more than 56,000. Some legislation filed this year would make it easier to opt out of vaccines or prevent state health officials from tracking exemption data. On Wednesday, worries over vaccination exemptions in Texas could even creep into a vote over a new $250 billion state budget. A Democrat filed one amendment that would study vaccination levels at child-care facilities. \u201cThat a case of pertussis was confirmed on the House floor should be a wake-up call,\u201d said Rekha Lakshmanan, director of advocacy and public policy for The Immunization Partnership, based in Houston. \u201cThe fact it happened inside lawmakers\u2019 own house should give everyone a reality check.\u201d ___ Follow Paul J.

The company revealed in its annual report on Wednesday that it had received subpoenas from the U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission related to talc litigation. Some plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers, however, played down the impact of the ruling. It was a trial in St. Louis\u2019s 22nd Circuit Court, brought by 21 plaintiffs from outside of the city whose cases were joined to that of a single St. Louis resident, that in July produced a record $4.69 billion talc verdict against J&J. The company is facing several more such lawsuits in St. Louis. However, Missouri\u2019s high court on Feb. 13 ruled in a separate talc case that allowed a non-resident to participate in joined cases was \u201ca clear and direct violation\u201d of state law barring the use of joinder - combining two or more cases - to allow courts to hear cases they otherwise could not. Most state courts can only hear cases involving plaintiffs or defendants from that state or alleging injuries occurring within their jurisdiction. The U.S. Supreme Court strengthened those restrictions in a 2017 decision. But the St. Louis court had allowed out-of-state residents to continue to sue New Jersey-based J&J through liberal use of joinder. In the case that produced the July verdict, 18 of the plaintiffs were from outside Missouri and three were from outside the city of St. Louis. Of the roughly 700 talc cases filed in St. Louis, only 40 involve Missouri residents, according to court filings. If the Feb. 13 ruling closes off the St. Louis court to non-resident claims, J&J may have a stronger hand defending itself in smaller talc cases spread out among other, potentially less plaintiff-friendly state and federal courts. \u201cThere\u2019s no real way of reading this decision other than this court clearly saying you can\u2019t join claims if the injury did not occur in the venue,\u201d said Mark Cheffo, a New York-based product liability defense lawyer not involved in talc litigation. J&J in a statement said it was pleased with the decision. \u201cOne claim that is properly before a court cannot provide a basis for drawing into a trial other claims that are not. We believe that decision is clearly correct, and we continue to believe that the science doesn\u2019t support plaintiffs\u2019 claims,\u201d the company said, declining further comment. Some plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers said the Feb. 13 ruling was not as definitive as Cheffo suggests. \u201cIf defendants are celebrating this ruling as the end of St. Louis mass tort, they have not read the entire Missouri case law,\u201d said Eric Holland, a St. Louis-based plaintiff lawyer involved in the talc litigation. Holland pointed to a 2016 Missouri Supreme Court decision that upheld a $38 million verdict in a pharmaceutical product liability case the defendant claimed had been improperly joined. The court let the result stand, saying that even an improper joinder did not render the trial unfair to defendants. Though the 2016 ruling involved a case already decided, Holland and other plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers said they planned to argue its fairness analysis also applies to out-of-state talc claims in cases yet to go to trial. They said they would also argue joining the cases was the most efficient use of judicial resources. Defense lawyers said the Feb. 13 decision would likely mean dismissal or severing of the out-of-state claims from four upcoming multi-plaintiff cases scheduled for trial in St. Louis. Two of the cases were halted by the Missouri Supreme Court ahead of its ruling. Holland and other plaintiff lawyers said they would challenge J&J requests to sever or dismiss talc cases by arguing the Feb. 13 decision did not overrule the 2016 ruling. Cheffo said the 2016 ruling could make it harder for J&J to overturn the July verdict and its record penalty because the company would have to prove the joinder led to an unfair trial. \u2018FORUM SHOPPING\u2019 BY OUT-OF-STATE PLAINTIFFS  The St. Louis court has been a venue for more talc trials and has seen larger verdicts than any other jurisdiction. Outside of St. Louis, the only other significant talc verdicts against J&J to date have come in lawsuits filed by individual plaintiffs in New Jersey and California, where the company is currently facing jury verdicts totaling $142 million. A Los Angeles jury delivered a $417 million talc verdict against J&J in 2017, but the judge threw out the award weeks later as unsupported by the evidence. All talc verdicts against J&J are on appeal. The St. Louis court has a history of issuing large punitive damages against companies and has often been criticized by business groups as allowing \u201cforum-shopping\u201d by out-of-state plaintiffs. While J&J faces some trials brought by individuals in other jurisdictions, the multi-plaintiff St. Louis cases are the largest and have the most potential to produce additional billion-dollar verdicts. Plaintiffs allege that the talc in Johnson\u2019s baby powder and other J&J products causes ovarian cancer, or that asbestos contamination in the talc causes ovarian cancer and mesothelioma. Asbestos is a known carcinogen linked to mesothelioma. J&J and its talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, a co-defendant in the litigation, deny the allegations, saying numerous studies and tests by regulators worldwide have shown their talc to be safe and asbestos-free. Reuters on Dec. 14 published a report detailing that J&J knew that the talc in its raw and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos from the 1970s into the early 2000s - test results it did not disclose to regulators or consumers. (reut.rs/2Gh88KO)   J&J is currently facing roughly 13,000 lawsuits over talc, most of which have been consolidated in federal court in New Jersey. Many plaintiff\u2019s lawyers have fought to keep cases out of federal court, which they feel favors corporate defendants. Three juries have rejected claims that Baby Powder was tainted with asbestos or caused plaintiffs\u2019 mesothelioma. Five other juries have failed to reach verdicts, resulting in mistrials. In a statement, Imerys Talc America said the Missouri ruling affirmed legal arguments it has made in litigation for the last four years. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Feb. 13, saying it lacked the financial clout to defend against talc lawsuits.", "output": "Court ruling could help J&J defeat St. Louis talc lawsuits.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "Burack died Sunday in hospice care in Jackson, New Hampshire, said his son, Tom Burack, former commissioner of the state Department of Environmental Services.

Morgan Carroll, an Aurora Democrat. Its mailer focused on reproductive rights, abortion and Roe v. Wade. In the email, titled \"\"2016 goal: A Congress that fights for women and families,\"\" Emily's List said, \"\"We wish Congress was less like this\"\" -- citing Mike Coffman's co-sponsorship of the 2011 bill -- \"\"and more like this \u2026 Morgan Carroll sponsored a bill to make emergency contraception available to sexual assault survivors.\"\" We wanted to check the accuracy of Emily's List's characterization of Coffman's role in the legislation. Coffman did co-sponsor the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortions Act, which attempted to redefine a ban on federal funding for abortions to exempt \"\"forcible rape\"\" -- and not rape in broader terms. Critics said the \"\"forcible rape\"\" language could rule out other forms of sexual assault that are considered rape, including statutory rape, attacks where women are drugged or threatened, and date rapes. Facing a backlash from women's groups, Republicans amended the bill in committee to remove the word \"\"forcible\"\" and make the exemption for \"\"rape.\"\" Coffman wasn't on this committee and didn't vote on the removal. \"\"The bill was amended in committee, and Congressman Coffman supported the amended bill on the floor,\"\" a Coffman campaign spokesman later said. Congressional records show that Coffman voted for the amended bill in a floor vote, which passed the House but not the Senate. In recent years, Coffman has tempered his position on abortion in one of the country's most competitive \"\"swing\"\" districts, which is nearly evenly divided among Democrats, Republicans and independents. In 2012, he said, \"\"I am against all abortions, except when it is necessary to protect the life of the mother.\"\" But a year later, Coffman said that while he supported a House bill to limit late-term abortions, \"\"I strongly support the exceptions for rape, incest, and protecting the life of the mother that have been included in this legislation.\"\" Coffman's Democratic opponent, Morgan Carroll, had blunt criticism of his co-sponsoring the 2011 bill's original \"\"forcible rape\"\" language. \"\"Rape is about the lack of consent -- not the degree of force -- and this definition takes us backwards,\"\" Carroll told Denver7. \"\"I unequivocally support a woman's right to make her own decisions about her own body, including her health care,\"\" she said. Coffman's spokeswoman complained that political opponents have repeatedly raised the 2011 bill and \"\"will twist the facts any way they can in an attempt to mischaracterize and demonize Rep. Coffman.\"\" Our ruling Emily\u2019s List said that Coffman \"\"co-sponsored a bill to redefine rape.\"\" The record shows Coffman did co-sponsor the bill to redefine a ban on federal funding for abortions to exempt \"\"forcible rape.\"\" Yet he later voted on the floor for an amended version that had removed the \"\"forcible\"\" modifier from the bill.

A national organization representing publicly funded family planning providers said Monday it would file a separate lawsuit over the policy. The new rules announced Friday by the Department of Health and Human Services would bar taxpayer-funded family planning clinics from making abortion referrals. They would also prohibit clinics that receive federal money from sharing office space with abortion providers \u2014 a rule that Ferguson said would force many to find new locations, undergo expensive remodels or shut down. Clinics that receive money under Title X, the 1970 law designed to improve access to reproductive health care for communities around the nation, provide a wide array of services, including birth control and screening for diabetes, sexually transmitted diseases and cancer. Beyond interfering in a patient\u2019s relationship with her doctor, Ferguson said, the rules could leave vast areas without such care for low-income residents. \u201cRural communities currently have a shortage of health care providers,\u201d Ferguson told reporters. \u201cThis rule will make the shortage even more acute.\u201d Abortion is a legal medical procedure, but federal laws prohibit the use of taxpayer funds to pay for abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the woman. Religious conservatives and abortion opponents have long complained that Title X has been used to indirectly subsidize abortion providers. Chris Plante, policy director of the Christian group Family Policy Institute of Washington, called the legal challenge \u201cwrongheaded\u201d and said the new policy \u201csimply returns the Title X regulations back to their original legislative intent: \u2018None of the funds appropriated under this title shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning.\u2019\u201d \u201cA doctor can still talk about abortion,\u201d Plante said. \u201cThe doctor simply can\u2019t say, \u2018There\u2019s an abortion provider three streets down, turn left.\u2019\u201d While the new rule would permit clinic staff to discuss abortion with clients, it would no longer be required that they do so. If patients ask for an abortion referral, staff would be required to give a list of primary care providers with no indication as to which provide abortions. The list would have to include providers who do not offer abortions, and it could not include clinics or organizations that aren\u2019t primary care providers, such as Planned Parenthood, Ferguson said. Ferguson, who has filed nearly three dozen lawsuits against the Trump administration, including over the travel ban, said he would file the challenge in federal court in Spokane, in eastern Washington, after the policy is made official with its publication in the federal register. He intends to seek a court order blocking it from taking effect. Eastern Washington has 20 counties, 11 of which would be left without Title X providers, he said. Across Washington state in 2017, 14,000 patients received federally funded services at 85 of the clinics, many of them operated by Planned Parenthood. Ferguson said Trump\u2019s policy violates the Affordable Care Act, which protects providers and patients from government interference in the health care relationship, and a federal law that requires doctors to provide information about abortion and prenatal care to patients in an unbiased manner. It also violates the Administrative Procedures Act by contradicting Title X regulations without sufficient justification, and it violates doctors\u2019 right to free speech and women\u2019s right to an abortion under Roe v. Wade, he alleged. The National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association said it would sue separately. Erin Berry, Washington state medical director of Planned Parenthood of the Great Northwest and the Hawaiian Islands, was one of many advocates who joined Ferguson at his news conference. \u201cI cannot imagine withholding information from my patients. It\u2019s unethical,\u201d she said. \u201cPoliticians have no business telling me what I can talk to my patients about.\u201d", "output": "Washington state to sue over Trump\u2019s new abortion policy.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}]
