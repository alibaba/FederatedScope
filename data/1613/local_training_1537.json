The roots of Donald Trump's shocking, long-shot, and divisively improbable rise to the presidency can be traced back to election night four years ago when black voter percentage, for the first time in American history, surpassed whites. Black voters led the multiracial groups of voters that re-elected Barack Obama and seemed poised to do so in future presidential election cycles. But a strange thing happened on the way to a rendezvous with victory. The Supreme Court's 2013 Shelby v. Holder decision did more than just effectively gut law enforcement provisions of the Voting Rights Act. More profoundly, it neutralized black voter participation in key electoral battleground states, including North Carolina and Florida -- states that provided president-elect Trump's margins of victory.Peniel Joseph: Trump's victory isn't the fault of black votersSince 2012, voting rights for African Americans have been under attack \n Questions:During the 19th century and earlier, enslaved _ were denied the vote and punished, even killed for openly expressing dreams of black citizenship.

Monday's decision is indeed a big victory for voters \u2014 but it is also a stark reminder that free, fair and accessible elections in the United States are not as guaranteed as you might think. To fix this, we need to modernize our election system. The Supreme Court took a critical step toward this, confirming Congress' broad authority to regulate how we conduct federal elections, particularly as politicians in states across the country continue to push new laws that would make it harder for Americans to vote. Dozens of restrictive measures passed in 19 states before the 2012 election. Citizens, the courts, and the Justice Department blocked or weakened most of them, but the push has continued in 2013. The court's decision gives federal lawmakers an even stronger basis to provide minimum national standards for voting and bring our election system into the 21st century.Wendy Weiser: Supreme Court's Arizona ruling points up need for voting modernization in U.S.Court said Congress, not states, regulates vote.
