The variables:  1) I have two Lhasapoos (mixed breed), almost 13 yrs old, with healthy teeth. 2) One is 13 lbs & one is 11 lbs, comparable in size to a large (not fat) house cat. 3) They are fed dry dog food, which is left in a feeder, so they eat whenever they like -- even so, they only eat small amounts. 4) When they are given a \"treat,\" it's not all the time, and they receive either a dog biscuit or a raw-hide stick -- never people food.  When I opened the bag, the Newman treats didn't smell any differently than their usual dog biscuits, and I was concerned with the large size. I noticed they had an indentation in the middle, but only a few biscuits were easy to break in half; most of them were just too hard to snap -- and I have strong hands...I can't imagine someone with arthritis being able to break one of these in half. The Newman treats are a great size for a bigger breed, like a golden retriever, for instance.  I put the Newman biscuits in the same canister that I use for other treats, even though the bag is resealable. I wasn't sure if the bag would affect my dogs' reactions to a new treat. By the way, I did read all the ingredients on the bag & it all looked healthy to me. I didn't see a reason why the dogs wouldn't like the treats.  I gave them half a piece each, after their morning potty break; they do not eat at night because they sleep in our bedroom with the door closed. They appeared very excited until the pieces were in their mouths, and then both dogs spit the pieces out & stared at me like I just tried to feed them dirt. I told them, \"you're not getting anything else for a treat,\" and walked away; they reluctantly ate the pieces. Over the past week or so, I've given them a whole biscuit every other day. They always eat them, but they don't wolf them down (no pun intended, really) they way they do with their <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EBIP5W\">Milk-Bone Biscuits for Small Dogs</a>.  Perhaps it is a texture issue? Too bad my dogs can't tell me...not to give TMI, but I am the one who does \"poop patrol\" in the backyard & the biscuits don't seem to have affected the consistency or size of the poop. (Look, I don't normally review dog food -- I'm not sure what other dog owners would be concerned about LOL)  Anyway, I don't recommend this product for dogs under 25 lbs, or dogs with weak teeth or dental problems that could affect crunching-ability.", "output": "3", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1215.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a review from Amazon's food products.

Regular soda is one of those 'bad' things.  Loaded with artificial colors, sweeteners, corn syrup...yuck.  Hardly seems worth the risk when I'm also getting 150 empty calories on average.  And now Switch has come along.  True to its claim, there's nothing artificial in it.  Just juice, sparkling water and other 'all natural' ingredients.  That's great.

Yes, I can 'taste' the orangy citrus, but as much I can taste the apple and grape juices used as well.  Moreover, this doesn't have that bold 'pop' to it as other carbonated beverages have.  I've had mineral water with more bite.  But the worse part about this 'good for me' drink is in clocks in at 140 calories (the same as a regular can of Coke) and 36gcarb/34g sugar (compared with Coke at 39/39).  On the up side, it has less than half the sodium as many regular colas and does deliver 100% Vit C and 20% Vit A.

They have a bit of a gritty texture, and they don't taste the way you hope they will when thinking of an Oreo.  They are worth eating if you have a bad craving, but I can't eat more than one or two.  The different taste gets to me.  There may be an ingredient in them that doesn't agree with me.  They contain vegetable oils, just like Oreos do.  Palm oil is in practically everything these days because it is cheap for companies to use.  When I eat it, it leaves a thick, greasy film in my mouth and throat.  Store-made cake frostings, cookies, cupcakes...anything that has it leaves that feeling, and I don't like it at all.  Some are worse than others, making it hard to swallow.  This happened when I ate a double-stuf chocolate WhoNu cookie.  Palm oil is listed as an ingredient.  I stopped buying them and the regular chocolate.  I only get the vanilla version.  They contain palm oil as well, but I'm guessing it is less because they don't bother me.  I like them much better.  It's weird because I like chocolate sandwich cookies better than vanilla ones in general.  But with Whonu, the vanilla wins for me.  Yesterday I had a craving for a chocolate sandwich cookie, and I bought Oreos.  Even Oreos don't taste as good as they used to.  I guess since the trans fat change in products.  The WhoNu cookies have the extra vitamins and nutrients, and less sodium.  But the Oreos have a better flavor.  The difference in fat content doesn't seem to be very different.  Actually, the difference in sodium doesn't seem very significant, either.  I decided I'd rather eat a few Oreos than a few of these.

Most breads have wheat or if they are gluten free, they cost way too much.  I have eaten all kinds of rice cakes. I have found that most will break apart if you're spreading a nut butter on them. Not these! Also there are generally 13 rice cakes in a pkg of round regular rice cakes... this package of rice cakes has 27 pieces in each bag. Also, it's much like consuming a slice of bread without the crusts and they are nice and thin so you don't eat too much of a good thing.  Try these if you're dissatisfied with regular rice cakes or if you must have gluten free bread!! I don't believe you will be sorry and Amazon's price is so good and FREE shipping... though the box is sort of big, it's pretty light and stores easily away. I live alone and I'm on my next to last pkg from my first case and they are not at all stale. I stored them in my cool dark garage in their original cardboard box.  Also they are made in Belgium if that helps anyone. The packaging is air tight and they come 12 pkgs in a box and are in the perfect sized box, and mine arrived without a sign of any damage and I have yet to find even a single cracked rice cake! They are rather neutral in their taste... I make a special butter spread that I like on them real well. You take equal parts of room temperature butter, olive oil and water and blend ingredients until smooth. You can refrigerate this, it sets up but doesn't get hard so it is always spreadable and tastes really good! I use organic butter, olive oil and filtered water, but you don't have. This spread is so good and I believe it's better for you than straight butter.  Also, I only use one cake to make a single sided sandwich, as with any rice cake using two as you would two pieces of bread just doesn't seem to work as well. But a single sided sandwhich with these rice cakes is very enjoyable!  Hope this helps you decide to try them.

Surprisingly, I was pretty impressed with the flavor which to me tastes almost as good as regular Bisquick.  I followed a reviewer's suggestion to let the batter sit for about 15 minutes after adding just the milk; the batter looked better and was a nicer consistency after the resting time. It was a little hard to get all the lumps out of the batter though and because I have limited GF experience I wasn't sure whether further stirring would gum it up so I left some lumps in and they dissolved while cooking.

I'm not a huge eater, and found the volume of this to be okay. I'm glad I brought some corn chips to supplement (I know, not the best combo). The taste was okay too, though not, in my mind, much better than most ramen or Cup o Noodles or Maruchan type things. Really, it was like a squirt of sriracha in a cup of chicken ramen. Which is fine. Good. And this doesn't have MSG, so that's nice, and it comes in a bowl, so that's nice. There are flakes of veggies, and a couple pea-sized chunks of very spongy chicken. It took me a while to realize that the spongy stuff was chicken. Seems about right for this kind of product.  I can't leave the office for lunch, so I'm always looking for something I can tuck in a desk drawer and actually enjoy. Given that it is in a microwaveable (non-styrofoam) bowl, and I like the idea of squirting sriracha in my ramen, this is a good option. Given how infrequently I'll use them, though, I might splurge and go for a much more expensive but slightly more gourmet bowl of noodles (Annie Chun, etc). On the other hand, if I were going to eat them more frequently, I might want to splurge and go for a more expensive but healthier alternative.

The flavor reminded me a lot of lays bqq but a bolder version of it, the sweet bqq flavor with a bold kick at the end. My bags had very few broken chips in them. Everything about this order was great.  My father was around when I was trying my first bag, making fun of them cause they were healthy. I offered him one and he accepted probably to do some dramatic spitting it out and eww effect. He looked at me confused once he ate it, promptly took the bag out of my hand and walked away with it.

Every time I get an infection, my right maxillary sinus swells up like a balloon. Sleeping at night on account of this condition is terribly difficult; I often have to resort to using Afrin to decongest my sinuses, which is effective but also very painful and not a realistic, long term solution because of rebound congestion. Now I already irrigate with a motorized system, often upwards of 8-10X daily when I'm sick, and drinking herbal tea has also become a pasttime to help cope with my sinus disease. That being said, I bought this tea out of sheer desperation. I'll try (and have tried) next to anything to give myself some relief while I wait for antibiotics to take effect. The only thing which I find works even close to as well as Afrin is to megadose on Psuedoephedrine (240 1-2 times per day), which is something that is also unsustainable. So, keep in mind that the severity of my sinus condition is drastic. What I found with this tea is that it seems to help, but I can't tell whether or not it works any better than domestic teas that tout similar claims (Yogi's Breathe Deep and Cold Buster, Celestial Sleepytime Sinus Soother, and other respiratory-aiding herbal formulations).

I like to brew this on the smallest setting (4oz) and then add milk to fill the cup and warm it in the microwave, I think that gives a richer taste.

", "input": "I was one of fifty families chosen to receive Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters for free to do a product review on.  Once I received my Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters in the mail, I and two of my grandsons decided to do the taste test immediately.  The box of Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters comes with five individual packages.  Each package is 100 calories.  In fact, the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are advertised as being 100 calorie packs so that people will know exactly how many calories they are having so there is no guesswork involved.  Each 100 calorie package comes with three Oreo mini cakesters which translates to each mini cakester having approximately thirty-three and one third calories.  The appearance of the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters is one of tiny chocolatey goodness.  They are a dark chocolate color with a thin slice of cream filling and are soft and slightly crumbly.  When you put a Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters into your mouth, they crumble into a delicious chocolate cake flavor.  In fact, they do remind me a little of having a small bite of chocolate cake.  The Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters mostly have a chocolate flavor and the cream filling isn't as easily tasted or rather it wasn't possible to isolate the flavor of the cream from the chocolate but I didn't have a problem with this and neither did either of my grandsons.  My oldest grandson ate almost two 100 calories packs of the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters minus one or approximately 167 calories.  He enjoyed eating them and even gave Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters his `lick of approval' to the wrapper they came in!  My youngest grandson isn't able to communicate effectively verbally (he's special needs) but I considered his dedication to eating his Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters as a sign of approval as seen through his chocolate face and intensity as he ate his 100 calorie pack plus the one loose one from his older brother or his approximately 134 calories.  I definitely give the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters a thumbs up.  I believe that I really got a true sense of how good they tasted from my two 100 calorie packs or 200 calories worth of Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters that I ate. I honestly didn't mean to eat both 100 calorie packs but that last one was sitting there calling my name and my adult daughter was not home yet so, I ate it.  But luckily I know that all I had was 200 calories which in the grand scheme of things is not too bad at all!  I like the fact that the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are presented as a 100 calorie pack.  I found the thought comforting especially since I ate two packages of them!  I even found it fun to know how many calories my grandsons were consuming of them too!!  I am diabetic and overweight besides so knowing the calorie count is a good thing for me.  I think the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are good for a small chocolatey treat when you just want something sweet and chocolate but you don't want to overindulge.  If I have any complaint about the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters, it would be that they are too small!!  But since that is actually part of their appeal, I don't consider their small size a problem.  I do recommend Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters for anyone who wants a small and controlled portion of a chocolate treat because they are the perfect size to keep you in control of your diet instead of letting the chocolate treat control you.", "output": "5", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1215.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a review from Amazon's food products.

", "input": "What is \"four ears up\"?  Read on, I'll explain later.  The first thing I did when I received the Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley Treats was to read the lable.  Darn near everything is listed as organic.  Whether that is good or bad is a matter of personal opinion and personally, I don't even look for organic food for myself.  Is organic food actually healthier?  I don't know, but for the purposes of this review, that's neither here nor there.  The treats themselves are hard and crunchy and about 1\" x 2\" in size.  Each is scored so they can be broken in half.  I preferred to break them in half for all my dogs even though none would have had issues with the size.  My house seems to revolve around my 4 rescued dogs, 2 Australian Kelpie mixes, a Yellow Lab mix, and a beautiful Heinz 57, maybe a doberman/border collie mix.  Weights run from 30 lbs to 85 lbs.  At one point in their lives, all of them had been abused and I do know for a fact that 2 had been starved.  As a result none are too picky about dog food or treats.  When presented with the Newman's treats for the first time 3 dogs took them quickly, but not as quickly as usual.  One dropped the treat and sniffed it before eating it.  My lab spent about 15 seconds sniffing before she would take it.  When given their regular brand of treats, the lab usually sniffs for just a second before taking it and the others just grab and inhale them.  At another treat time each dog was presented with 2 treats side by side on the floor, one of the Newman's and one of their regular brand.  Two dogs, including the hesitant Lab, chose their regular brand first before eating the Newman's.  The 2nd time I tried that, 3 out of four at their regular brand first.  That pretty much ended the experimentation and I just gave the Newman's treats until they were gone. One of the Kelpies actually refused the Newman's a couple of times which for him was highly unusual since he's usually the first in line at treat time. The others never did seem overly excited about eating organic but did eat them.  When we changed back to the usual brand they scarfed them down as usual.  Now we get to the \"four ears up\".  When my four are really excited about something they will sit at full attention with their ears completely perked up.  At the treat times when they were being fed the Newman's, they initially started out with perked ears then once they found out what they were getting, their excitement faltered and they seemed somewhat indifferent.  Since there are four dogs with 2 ears each, an \"8 ears up\" would be a perfect rating where they were excited about eating or doing something.  Since, with the 2 exceptions, they never did refuse the Newman's but ate them without much excitement, these treats get a \"four ears up\" rating, pretty much middle of the road.  If feeding your dogs organic treats is important to you, definately give thee a try.  Just be forewarned that they may be a bit on the large side for small dogs and they do seem harder and crunchier than some other brands.  Given the cost and the lackluster response from my dogs, it's highly unlikely that I'll be giving them the Newman's in the future.", "output": "3", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1215.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a review from Amazon's food products.

I ordered two grades, a higher grade with bigger shroom pieces, less stems, etc, and in retrospect, should have just ordered the scraps, or even the dust, as I found the big pieces stayed a nasty tough chewy texture, even after hours of cooking, I also extracted just juice from the mushrooms, but the broth wasn't strong enough to bother, I basically just chop these in the food processor, and add a LOT of them to get a change in flavor in recipes, the one ounce bags, don't even bother with, because it takes a lot to get some flavor from them.  In all honesty, I have not used another Poricini product, so I can't compare, but, I am disappointed with the results I got from these, it may be they do exactly what they are supposed to, for some one with a very tender palate, but, not for me, and in no case, are these ever going to be rehydrated and served on steak, they just stay too nasty of a product to serve by themselves, strictly good for grinding and using in a recipe.", "output": "2", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1215.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a review from Amazon's food products.

", "input": "Every Revolution product I have tried has been a wonderful experience.  Revolution knows how to balance the inherit flavors of tea leaves with other ingredients which make each tea unique and enjoyable.  Better Than The Rest  I've been buying this particular tea consecutively for the better half of a year now, and I simply love it. No other pomegranate tea comes close to this one in terms of quality and taste.  For example, Trader Joe's store brand (while good) seems as if it has been sweetened (to the point where it's too sweet), and surprisingly the tea turns red after less than a minute of seeping indicating that coloring was added (I didn't check the ingredients, so I may be wrong about this).  There's also Yogi's pomegranate tea which uses a green tea and creates an entirely different taste. I liked it; didn't love it.  Complimenting Flavors  Pomegranates are often compared to apples.  In fact, pomegranate means \"seeded apple\" (from latin: pomum - apple and granatus - seeded), and like an apple the fruit is sweet and tart, but has a very strong and distinct flavor.  Thus, a light white tea is the perfect companion; it doesn't overpower the pomegranate flavor but allows it to mingle on the tongue.  Likewise, the amount of pomegranate, or rather the intensity of the pomegranate flavor, is truly perfect.  No flavor overpowers the other, but rather all the flavors compliment one another.  Brewing  I'm sure someone out there will say that I'm butchering tea when I brew this, but when I do, I leave the tea bag in the mug until I've consumed it all.  I find that the taste never gets too strong and never gets bitter.  Typically this is only the case for herbal teas, which don't become overpowered since they contain no tea leaves.  In this case the same is true, perhaps because it is a white tea which is naturally light. The tea itself literally contains dried pomegranate seeds (flesh included).  Do you know that taste you get a few moments after you eat a pomegranate seed? (If you don't, try it! It's wonderful.)  That initial bite from the tartness followed by sweetness you get (or at least I get) from a pomegranate is captured in this tea, and it makes sense! There's pomegranate seeds in there!  Conclusion  Buy this tea!  I was a little skeptical about my first purchase since I was buying 6 boxes, but it was a great choice that I do not in the least bit regret.  I've bought this for myself and for family, with everyone absolutely loving it.

The main value is as a unique gift.   In the Japanese soy sauce world, there are 4 types: regular, mild (usukuchi), for raw fish (sashimi) and light colored.  Bluegrass soy sauce is regular style.  Compared to Kikoman (a good commercial brand that is widely available) Bluegrass starts saltier, is flat in the middle, then ends with a complex & interesting flavor.  Kikoman is less salty initially and has a round, full flavor in the middle.  Doesn't have the complex ending flavors.  For me, the initial saltiness of Bluegrass is a minus and Kikoman's full middle flavor is a plus.  I prefere Kikoman, especially for dipping sushi where the flavor is more direct.  But I lived in Japan for many years and am used to the standard Japanese flavor.  I haven't tried Bluegrass blended in other food as a background flavor, which is how soy sauce is usually used.

You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read \"maltitol\" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it.

Best when used at the conclusion of the cooking process, to release all their aroma and perfume. Chefs suggest to slice or shave thinly over pastas, risottos and omelets. Whole -entire truffles- are marked \"brushed\" (which means they have been cleaned of any soil or dirt), preserved in brine or truffle juice -which can be discarded or use to flavor sauced or broths -and are ready to use.  Preserved truffles are a nice, budget-friendly way to add VISUAL truffle appeal to dishes. However, if you are looking to add the pungent aroma and taste of truffles to your dish, chefs recommend that you explore fresh truffle selections. Jarred or canned truffles, sold by vendors, are mere shadows of their fresh truffle selves and will not, by themselves, deliver the aroma or flavor of fresh truffles. They are great to use with truffle oil - the oil will add the flavor, the preserved truffles the truffle \"look\", but preserved truffles should be used only to garnish a dish, or in conjunction to truffle butter and oil during those times when fresh truffles are out of season or when the budget doesn't allow for the real thing. NOTE: Preserved truffles out of the jar or can have almost NO FLAVOR or odor. If you are looking for the true flavor of a fresh truffle, then please go to seek fresh truffle pages online and purchase a fresh truffle. If you're looking to add a truffle LOOK only to your dish, then this is the product for you.

Upon opening the package I was happy with the portability of the carrying bag, and shocked at how lightweight and compact this system is. It's a great accessory to throw in the trailer when taking the horses out, or just to have around in the event that we need a temporary corral for a couple horses. Once set up, it won't hold more than two of our horses comfortably. I don't think we'd ever try and manage to get 4 inside like the product advertises!  The instructions were surprisingly simple and it set up easily between myself and my husband working on it. I can see how this would be great to have for other animals as well (such as alpacas), but we only have need for it with the horses and have had success in containing them.  The step in posts are fantastically designed, the overall design makes the fence very versatile, setting up easily pretty much anywhere your horse an go.  We're very happy with it's design and portability and will get a lot of good use out of this system, I think!", "output": "4", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1215.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a review from Amazon's food products.

Cool!\"  The second and third cracker though, I noticed a really starchy, floury taste coming through. I looked at the ingredients. Corn starch was the first ingredient.  I tend not to like gluten free products made mostly from corn starch. They are light, sure, but kind of flavorless and powdery if you chew for any length of time.  Brown rice flour or millet gives such a great depth of flavor, and it's an actual whole grain, not just a grain after all the protein and nutrients are taken out. Even white rice flour would be better.  Corn starch, however is cheaper so I think that's why it gets used a lot.  If you liked white flour, starchy foods before you went gluten free you might like these. If you prefer whole grains or even actual flour (not just the starch) I would try something else. I like Christie's multigrain crackers or brown rice thins.", "output": "3", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1215.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a review from Amazon's food products.

", "input": "Ordered this on the advice of the Single Serve Coffee forum.  CONS:  Drawer is metal mesh on metal mesh, so it doesn't slide smoothly.  It's pretty clunky to pull open and even harder to close. It doesn't pull out far enough to reach the back of the drawer, so you have to tip the final K-Cup out, which is hard if you have an entire coffee maker on top. Again, all mesh, so the cups don't sit smoothly in the tray, and the sections are a hair too narrow so the cups brush one another awkwardly. My upper cabinets are raised higher than average because we are both tall, and this still didn't leave us enough room to open the maker while on the drawer.  PROS:  For our modern kitchen, it's nice to look at. It comfortable fits my Capresso FrothPro on one side and two 64oz Ghirardelli bottles (front to back) on the other so it still saves us counter space. When I tried my Keurig on it, I expected some buckling but it seemed to stand firm even with a full water tank.  All in all, for $25 it's a lot nicer to look at than the spinning barrel style holders, and I don't need my coffee to be on display.  Plus it looks easy to clean which for me is a plus.", "output": "3", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1215.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a review from Amazon's food products.
