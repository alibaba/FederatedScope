The dilution ratio was determined during each calibration by diluting air with oxygen and noting the reduction in the ratio of nitrogen to oxygen. Empiric correction was made by the computer for the effects of density and viscosity, relative to air, on the flow of nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, and the saturated vapors of the three anesthetics through the capillary resistor. The computer was programmed to control solenoid valves both for calibration and for the multiplexed sampling of operating rooms. Oxygen, nitrous oxide, and carbon dioxide were used as pure gases, and halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane were vaporized at room temperature in 50-ml vaporizers. The resulting calibrations were found to be accurate to within +/- 2%. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: Treatment and supervision of epileptic patients is part of specialist medicine. A possible change in the role of specialists and general practitioners in the care of these patients was explored by a questionnaire mailed to all Dutch neurologists and a random sample of general practitioners. Patients were also asked their opinion. The real situation was studied in a group of patients retrieved from the registers of general practitioners. Demographic, psychosocial, and epilepsy characteristics were sampled. Specialists tend not to want a change in their role; general practitioners desire a change. At present, patients do not want a change, but in future a change might be acceptable to them. More patients than expected were supervised by their general practitioner only. Their demographic and psychosocial characteristics did not differ from those in the population at large. Epilepsy characteristics corresponded with those in other studies. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "No", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: Methotrexate (MTX) appears to be useful in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) refractory to other drugs but its long-term toxicity and efficacy are uncertain. A retrospective study of MTX in such patients in comparison with the purine analogues, azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine was made using life-table analysis. Eighty-four patients took MTX in a median dose of 7.5 mg/week whilst 55 received purine analogues, 100 mg/day (median). By 12 months, 19.3% of patients had ceased MTX due to toxicity, compared with 29.3% for purine analogues. Toxicity severe enough to warrant stopping therapy was uncommon after 8 months with either drug. At 12 months 61.5% of the MTX patients had achieved defined criteria of improvement compared with 25.6% for the purine analogues (p less than 0.05). The number of patients improving on purine analogues did not increase substantially after 6 months, whereas the number improving with MTX continued to 12 months. MTX in a low-dose regimen is useful in refractory RA and superior to low-dose purine analogues. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: Hand injuries in children are seen frequently in the office and the emergency room.

In three of six patients, subtle abnormalities in follicular development were detected. In the first case poor follicular growth was observed. There was a premature small rise of luteinizing hormone (LH) with subsequent low levels of estradiol (E2) in the late follicular phase and unusual wide LH peak. This was followed by low progesterone levels in the luteal phase. In the second case follicular growth was abrupted by premature LH surge. This surge was triggered by early rise of E2 level while the follicle was still small in size. In the third case luteinized unruptured follicle syndrome was diagnosed, on ultrasound examination. All of the abnormalities were repetitive. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: Infection of macrophages by the intracellular protozoan parasite Leishmania involves specific attachment to the host membrane, followed by phagocytosis and intracellular survival and growth. Two parasite molecules have been implicated in the attachment event: Leishmania lipopolysaccharide (L-LPS) and a glycoprotein (gp63). This study was designed to clarify the role of L-LPS in infection and the stage in the process of infection at which it operates. We have recently identified a Leishmania major strain (LRC-L119) which lacks the L-LPS molecule and is not infective for hamsters or mice. This parasite was isolated from a gerbil in Kenya and was identified phenotypically as L. major by isoenzyme and fatty acid analysis. In this study we have confirmed at the genotype level that LRC-L119 is L. major by analyzing and comparing the organization of cloned DNA sequences in the genome of different strains of L. major. Here we show that LRC-L119 promastigotes are phagocytosed rapidly by macrophages in vitro, but in contrast to virulent strains of L. major, they are then killed over a period of 18 hr. In addition, we show that transfer of purified L-LPS from a virulent clone of L. major (V121) into LRC-L119 promastigotes confers on them the ability to survive in macrophages in vitro. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: Surgical experience with grafts of human dura mater sterilized by gamma rays and preserved in alcohol is reported in 804 cases.

Annual inspection for sterility and immunogenicity over an 18-year period indicates that this system of preservation is valid for an unlimited period of time. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: Cell cultures of human keratinocytes contain membrane-associated thioredoxin reductase that is extremely active in reducing radicals on the outer plasma membrane. This enzyme activity was confirmed by its purification from cultures of stratified human keratinocytes by affinity column chromatography. The enzyme was assayed both in vivo and in vitro using a spin-labeled quaternary ammonium compound as the substrate, under saturating conditions in free radical substrate. Specific activities were determined by monitoring the sequential decrease in the amplitude of the electron spin resonance signal per unit of cell protein. The following properties were found: Cultures of adult stratified cells have approximately twice the thioredoxin reductase activity of neonatal cells. The enzyme is inhibited by thioprotein inhibitors (i.e., parachloromecuribenzoate and dinitrochlorobenzene). The activity is regulated by calcium concentrations of the cell culture medium. Stratified keratinocytes are half as active in medium containing 2 mM Ca++ compared with 0.1 mM Ca++ concentration. Product inhibition of the enzyme occurs with oxidized coenzyme NADP+ (i.e., 87% inhibition of enzyme activity over 30 min). The enzyme is heat stable at temperatures of 70 degrees C for 10 min. It is inactivated at 75 degrees C. A comparative study of thioredoxin reductase activity on stratified differentiated and undifferentiated rapidly growing cells was performed. Also, enzyme activity was quantitated for cultured keratinocytes isolated from vitiliginous and normal skin of the same donor. The results of this study, and the connection between this enzyme activity and UV-generated free radicals are reconciled in terms of the mechanism of action and metabolic activity of thioredoxin reductase. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: Measurements of muscle pH (pHm) with the homogenate technique are routinely made when extensive phosphagen hydrolysis has occurred. Upon exposure of the homogenate to 37 degrees C in the pH meter, phosphocreatine and ATP were rapidly degraded to 35 and 60% of control concentrations after 30 s. Attempts at chemically arresting this hydrolysis were unsuccessful. Therefore we examined the significance of phosphagen hydrolysis on pHm measurement in human biopsies taken at rest and following intense electrical stimulation. To accomplish this, pHm was measured at 0 degree C, where extensive hydrolysis did not occur. On the same homogenate, pHm was measured at 0 degree C with phosphagens and at 0 and 37 degrees C after phosphagen hydrolysis. The effect of phosphagen hydrolysis on pHm at 0 degrees C was used to estimate this effect at 37 degrees C. In resting samples, phosphagen hydrolysis produced a nonsignificant acidification of 0.008 pH units and, in electrically stimulated samples, a nonsignificant alkalinization of 0.033 units. Measurements of homogenate PCO2 suggested that most of the CO2 remained in the sample during pHm measurement at 37 degrees C. The present work substantiates the use of the homogenate technique as an accurate and practical method for the estimation of intracellular pH in resting and exercise human muscle samples. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}, {"instruction": "Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract.", "input": "Abstract: A 56-year-old woman presented with a 10-year history of torsional diplopia and right monocular oscillopsia.

Adequate trials of oral carbamazepine, baclofen and phenytoin were unsuccessful in suppressing her symptoms. One year after her initial presentation, she underwent a right superior oblique tenectomy and a right inferior oblique recession.

Deoxycholate alone did not induce these reactions. The other bile acids such as cholate, chenodeoxycholate, ursodeoxycholate, and taurocholate were also active. Under the similar conditions, deoxycholate enhanced the secretagogue-induced diacylglycerol formation that was derived mainly from the phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate. Deoxycholate did not enhance the secretagogue-induced hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate or Ca2+ mobilization. Deoxycholate did not affect amylase secretion, which was induced by the simultaneous addition of protein kinase C-activating 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin. Since diacylglycerol and Ca2+ may be responsible for the secretagogue-induced amylase secretion, our results indicate that small amounts of bile acids increase the sensitivity to the secretagogue of diacylglycerol formation and subsequent activation of protein kinase C, and thereby enhance amylase secretion from pancreatic acini. \nQuestion: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?", "output": "Yes", "category": "Information Extraction 1248.json"}]
