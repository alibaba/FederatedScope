So in that resigned third Test over - all 22 runs of it - came the clues for what was to follow early on Sunday morning in Melbourne, when he abruptly called a halt to his Test career after 60 matches and 255 wickets.\nNothing should really feel that unexpected any more on an England tour that began poorly, lurched towards embarrassment and is now parked somewhere between farce and ignominy.\nAll the same, the dramatic departure of the man who was both the pivot of their four-man attack and the wise-cracking heartbeat of the dressing-room marks decisively the closing of a cricketing chapter for this once all-conquering England side.\nJonathan Trott is on indefinite leave with his stress-related illness; coach Andy Flower has refused to commit beyond January; three critical yet ageing senior players - Kevin Pietersen, James Anderson and Matt Prior - are each enduring their worst spell in years; and captain Alastair Cook is averaging less with the bat than the opposition's fast bowler.\nFor a team that came into the series as favourites, who won three consecutive Ashes, who went to number one in the Test rankings for the first time in history, these are now the End-of-Era Ashes.\nHow quickly empires can fall.\nThere are those who will find fault in Swann's timing, which some could claim was made to maximise publicity for his tabloid column back in the United Kingdom.\nHe only informed Cook and Flower of his decision late on Saturday and told his team-mates at a net session at the MCG early on Sunday.\nSome will also read into it a calculation that he was about to be dropped for the Boxing Day Test after taking just seven wickets at 80 runs apiece in this Ashes series.\nAs Swann said at his valediction, we will never know for sure whether the Test trap-door was indeed about to open. But the manner of his departure from the game should not obscure how much he gave to the England team, nor how essential he was to its defining days.\nFor a bowler whose first-class career at Northamptonshire began with figures of 1-91 off 13 overs - blame Surrey batsman Ali Brown for that - and spluttered to such an extent that he had to wait a further decade for his Test bow, he ends in company with the best.\nHe is the sixth-highest wicket-taker in his country's history; has statistically only Derek Underwood above him as a spinner; and claimed more wickets since his debut in December 2008 than any other bowler in Test cricket, including Dale Steyn and James Anderson.\nIn some ways, the mistakes that characterised his earlier years - oversleeping to miss the team bus on his first England tour in 1999, overestimating his own charm to such an extent that Darren Gough punched him in South Africa - helped him cherish all that was to follow.\nRevitalised by a county move from Northamptonshire to Nottinghamshire in 2005 and the input of coach Mick Newell and captain Stephen Fleming, Swann was rehabilitated at international level by Peter Moores in one of the unlamented England coach's few lasting achievements.\nIn his first over in Test cricket, he took the wickets of both Gautam Gambhir and Rahul Dravid - only the second man in history to start his career in such style - and over the next five years was there as both spinning spearhead and darting defence in all of England's great moments.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nAs an off-spinner, he came into Test cricket at a good time, when the advent of the decision review system made it considerably easier for bowlers of his type to win lbw decisions.\nBut if bowlers had in the past been denied that assistance, so Swann never benefited from uncovered pitches and also had to battle springier bats and shorter boundaries than Underwood and his legendary like.\nIn the Ashes series of 2009 came critical roles in the victories at Lord's and the Oval, including the last wicket to fall on that final improbable day in south London, when he had Mike Hussey caught to win back the urn and trigger nationwide celebration.\nIn between came perhaps his greatest ball - the clean-bowling of Australia captain Ricky Ponting at Edgbaston - and afterwards came even more: nine wickets in the unlikely defeat of South Africa in Durban; and five in the second innings as England thrashed Australia in Adelaide on the last, utterly contrasting tour down under.\nIn the summer, despite elbow surgery earlier in the year, he was at it again. He was England's leading wicket-taker with 26 in the series, including his 16th five-wicket haul, and became in the process the first English spinner since Hedley Verity in 1934 to take five wickets in an Ashes Test innings at Lord's.\nThe decline has been as swift as it was inarguable. \"I wasn't performing to a level that I thought was acceptable to myself or the team,\" he said on Sunday. \"You know when you're ready to go.\" Three years ago there was the sprinkler; this time there is only burn-out.\nEngland will miss more than his wickets.

The label on the photograph says it was taken on Jaluit Atoll in the Marshall Islands, presumably by a US spy.\nThe link might seem thin, though, to the legendary pilot who five years before her disappearance had risen to fame as the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic.\nThe claim is that one seated person with her back to the camera could be Earhart, while another figure on the far left in the photo is said to be Fred Noonan, her navigator on that last flight.\nOn the very right of the picture is a blurry section which, it is claimed, shows Earhart's plane.\nRic Gillespie, author of Finding Amelia and executive director of The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR), is certainly unconvinced.\nHe told the BBC: \"This photograph has people convinced. I'm astounded by this. I mean, my God! Look at this photograph... Let's use our heads for a moment. It's undated. They think it's from 1937. Okay. If it's from July 1, 1937 then it can't be Amelia, because she hadn't taken off yet.\n\"If it's from 1935 or 1938 it can't be her.... This photograph has to have been taken within a very narrow window - within a couple of days of when she disappeared.\"\nHe notes that the photograph came from an Office of Naval Intelligence file, saying it was \"very natural\" the US would want a picture of this Japanese naval asset.\n\"And what does the photo say that it shows? ... Jaluit Atoll - Jaluit Island. It doesn't say 'Amelia Earhart in Japanese custody'!\n\"If this is a picture of Amelia Earhart in Japanese custody, where are the Japanese? There are no soldiers in this picture. Nobody in uniform,\" he observes.\nThe photograph was released by the US-based History channel ahead of a documentary to run this weekend. If the goal was to drum up attention - and hence audience numbers - it appears to have paid off.\nA preview of the programme has two experts backing up the claim by looking at the torso measurements of the woman alleged to be Amelia Earhart in the photo, and teeth and hairline of the figure claimed to be Fred Noonan.\nA far stretch? After all, the heroine has her back to the camera and it's debatable how much of a hairline let alone teeth can really be made out reliably on a faded photograph from the 1930s.\nMr Gillespie says it doesn't match other known pictures of the famous aviator.\n\"The person who they say is Amelia Earhart might be a white woman. But her hair is way too long to be Amelia's. We have many pictures of Earhart taken the day before she took off, and her hair's a lot shorter than that.\"\nHe adds that the man identified as Fred Noonan does not, in his view, resemble the navigator. Further, his shirt is the wrong colour.\n\"The man is dressed in white. Noonan always wore dark shirts and dark slacks. Amelia didn't have a shirt like that with her on the trip either. So the Japanese have apparently given them new clothes.\n\"Everything about this is wrong,\" he concludes. \"I'm astounded.\"\nScepticism aside, the alleged scoop feeds into one of the existing theories about what happened to Earhart and her navigator.\nShe disappeared during her attempt to fly around the globe, trying to reach Howland Island in the Pacific for refuelling.\nThe official explanation is that she didn't find the island, lost communication and ran out of fuel, only to crash into the ocean.\nWhile that's a largely accepted version of events, there is no evidence - as in debris - to back it up.\nThe two other prominent theories are that Earhart crash-landed on or near the then-Japanese Marshall Islands, or that she made it to Nikumaroro island near Kiribati and died a castaway there.\nThere is no conclusive evidence for either of these theories - but that hasn't stopped amateur and professional historians from digging into them.\nParts of a skeleton found on Nikumaroro in 1940 were initially thought to have been hers, but doctors at the time decided they belonged to a male body.\nMr Gillespie, who backs the Nikumaroro theory, has led 11 expeditions in the South Pacific to research Earhart's fate. He points out that the island was uninhabited at the time when Earhart would have landed there.\nHe and his team have recovered artefacts which they say strongly suggest the presence of an American woman from the right era - including a makeup box from the 1930s, a popular US women's moisturiser, and a jacket zipper.\nMr Gillespie also cites the timing and location of radio distress calls sent by Earhart after her plane came down. He says the calls were sent \"night after night\" - which would suggest the plane was on land, not in the water - because if the radios got wet, they wouldn't work.\n\"After six nights the radio signals stopped,\" he told the BBC. \"We now think that's because the airplane was landed on the reef round the island, which is flat, smooth - dries at low tide... But the tide does come in and go out, and ... by the sixth night [he believes] the aeroplane was washed into the ocean by the tides.\n\"So when the planes from the battleship flew over the island a week later, no plane was visible.\"\nThe rest of the search took place in open ocean, and found nothing. The would-be rescuers concluded that Earhart and Noonan had sunk without a trace.\nThe conclusion drawn by the History documentary, based on the new Marshall Islands picture, is that Earhart was taken by the Japanese, later interned and eventually died a prisoner of war.\nThe Marshall Islands went from German to Japanese hands during World War One, and ahead of the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor became an important military post for Tokyo.\nThe Japanese archives have no records of Earhart as a prisoner - but with many documents from these archives known to have been lost, this does not necessarily prove the story wrong.\nAt the same time, the discovery of a single photograph that may or may not show the two lost pilots is likely to add to the mystery rather than solve it.", "output": "A newly-discovered photo suggests legendary US pilot Amelia Earhart might have died in Japanese custody - and not in a plane crash in the Pacific.", "category": "Summarization 416.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an article.

She comes from a golfing family and dabbled at an early age but it's only in the last two years that she has taken the sport seriously, cutting her handicap from 26 to 12 at Ladybank Golf Club and learning some valuable lessons along the way.\nHere, Hannah - who is a member of Sport Scotland's Young People's Sport Panel - explains how focusing on golf has altered her outlook on life...\nHannah: Golf didn't come naturally to me. I could pick up the basics of many other sports relatively quickly but golf had me stumped.\nHowever, I managed to transform this frustration into determination. I realised I had to focus on the happiness I felt when I had hit a good shot, to outweigh my sheer fury at the bad ones.\nFrom there I was hooked but now I needed to knuckle down and work hard, which is why I see golf as such a valuable learning opportunity. I realised the only way to get what you want out of life is through hard work and persistence.\nHowever, as crucial as practising my swing and my putting was to my improvement, I was overlooking a major aspect of golfing success - the need for mental strength.\nI began reading sports psychology books and researching authors who had worked with some of the best golfers but what I didn't realise was the core values it would enable me to transfer to my everyday life.\nHere are three of the key learnings I believe can help in all areas of life, sport, school or any other challenge:\n1. Stay in the present\nIn golf this means not allowing your mind to wander during your round. But I think this is crucial in life - it helps you to understand the importance of focusing on what is in front of you and not worrying too much about the future.\nIf you are thinking about the future, it means there is a lack of detail and attention on what you are currently doing.\n2. Commit to a pre-shot routine\nIn golf this means having a regimented routine you can carry out in order to apply the same level of commitment to each shot. I believe if you behave in a consistent manner, apply your beliefs and morals to all you do, you are more likely to reap reliable results.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n3. Don't label yourself\nIf you label yourself, say as someone who always shoots 80, then that is what you will do - because you become what you say you are. In life, too, as soon as you categorise yourself in a negative way it affects who you believe you can become, limiting your growth and chances of success.\nEven if you have no desire to take up golf, never overlook the lessons sport can teach you. They can help you realise things about yourself that you would never discover in a classroom.\nHopefully the above tips will help you as much as they've helped me, and remember - education is everywhere!\nFor more information on how to get into golf, check out our Get Inspired guide.", "output": "Many sports lend themselves to comparison with the ups and down of life in general, but golf is a particularly fertile ground for this kind of parallel.", "category": "Summarization 416.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an article.

Now, after a 3-0 win against Bolton which means only a loss, a Middlesbrough win and a 20-goal swing on the final day can deny them, they are celebrating a different piece of club history - playing in the Premier League for the first time.\nBournemouth's place in the elite of English football is a far cry from the financial problems the club has experienced over the past two decades.\nIn January 1997, the club were so penniless a bucket collection was arranged at the Winter Gardens in Bournemouth town centre. Players attended, money was raised and under the guidance of former chairman Trevor Watkins, Europe's first community club was formed as they came out of administration.\n\"I don't think many of us Bournemouth fans could have dreamt this was a possibility,\" Watkins told BBC Sport.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"We were down on our knees and collecting money in buckets. Current manager Eddie Howe was a player when the fans led the rescue. Our assistant manager Jason Tindall was one of the first signings the supporters' trust made at the end of the first season. Steve Fletcher was a player and they are all still together with that passion, spirit and togetherness.\"\nThat rescue act did not signal the end of the club's financial troubles, though. Problems continued and in 2008 the Cherries were placed in administration for the second time in just over 10 years.\nGerald Krasner of Begbies Traynor was appointed as the man tasked with saving the south coast club - who had debts of around \u00a34m at the time. Krasner recalls one particular occasion when he came within five minutes of closing them down.\n\"There was one press conference at 12 o'clock when, at five to 12, I didn't know if I had the money to continue trading,\" Krasner told BBC Sport. \"I came within five minutes of liquidating the club.\n\"It was only through the good grace of its current chairman Jeff Mostyn, who came up with the money for the next month, that the club came through that ordeal and successfully out of administration.\"\nKrasner revealed Mostyn paid out sums running into \"hundreds of thousands\" and never imagined they would be in the Premier League during those dark days.\n\"I can't honestly say I ever envisaged a time when Bournemouth would be in the Premier League in such a short time,\" he added. \"When I see them on Match of the Day next season I'll just have a big smile on my face.\"\nWhile the club survived administration they did not survive relegation and began the 2008-09 League Two season with a 17-point deduction and a transfer embargo.\nThings looked grim for the Cherries and when Jimmy Quinn was sacked on 31 December, the club appointed Howe as manager. He led them to a remarkable escape, with Fletcher's goal 10 minutes from time against Grimsby in their last home game of the season confirming survival.\n\"I vaguely remember the commentary 'It's Fletcher\u2026Legend!' as he smashed home a loose ball in the box,\" recalls BBC Radio Solent commentator Laurence Herdman.\n\"The big man ripped off his shirt during the goal celebration in front of the main stand revealing a muscular physique and rippling bodybuilder biceps. The goal kept AFC Bournemouth in the Football League and the Great Escape was complete.\"\nAll those struggles will now seem a world away as they prepare for life in the most popular - and most financially rewarding - league in world football.\n\"The reach of the Premier League is extraordinary,\" said Trevor Birch of business advisory firm BDO.\n\"It's now in over 200 countries and it reaches four billion people, so Bournemouth are going to be catapulted into the world's view.\"\nHowe, 37, has only been a manager for six years but has already achieved enough to be named as the first Football League manager of the decade.\nHe first arrived at the club as a shy 13-year-old defender and went on to break into the first team, establishing himself as a key player. Injury forced his early retirement from the game in 2007 but the lessons he learned as a player from various coaches were soon put into practice as a manager.\nHe was just 31 when he first took charge of the Cherries in January 2009, becoming the youngest boss in the Football League in the process.\nMeticulous in his preparation, Bournemouth's style as they have gone through the leagues has never altered, with Howe sticking to his philosophy of free-flowing, passing football.\nIn two spells he has guided them to Football League safety, promotion into League One the following season and - after a brief spell as manager of Burnley - a rise from the foot of League One to promotions to the Championship and, now, the Premier League.\nHarry Redknapp has always been considered Bournemouth's greatest manager - but even Redknapp accepts his status has gone.\n\"I had 10 years at Bournemouth and I was the most successful manager in their 100-year history. Eddie Howe has come along and blown me out of the water. He is fantastic - I love watching them play.\n\"If I wasn't involved next year, I'd buy a couple of season tickets and watch them every week.\"\nSo little is known of Bournemouth's mystery Russian millionaire owner, Maxim Demin, he could wander through the town centre and not be recognised.\nHe was introduced to the club by former chairman and owner Eddie Mitchell, who had been building Demin's house in Sandbanks. As time passed his influence grew, he became co-owner in 2011 and bought out Mitchell in 2013.\nDemin is based in Switzerland and is said to have been too superstitious to attend games during their run-in this season. He has made his money in petrochemicals and transformed the club both on and off the pitch. He is yet to give an official interview but Krasner is in no doubt how big his influence has been.\n\"He's made the difference between Bournemouth being just another Championship club fighting for survival and now having Premier League status,\" he said. \"The manager and the owner seem to work very well. If the owners and manager work well together you've got a much better chance of success.\"\nThe Cherries began the campaign with a 4-0 victory at Huddersfield, which sent them to the top of the Championship. It set the tone for the rest of the season.\nSix weeks of indifferent form followed before a 2-1 victory over Bolton sparked a six-game winning run that sent them back to the summit. From 4 November onwards, the club did not drop out of the top six as they held off the challenge of former Premier League clubs Middlesbrough and Norwich.\nTheir 8-0 win over Birmingham in October was the first time they had scored eight in a league game, barring a 10-0 win in 1939 which was expunged after World War Two broke out the next day.\nMore club records would tumble: most league goals in a campaign, most away league wins, most away league goals, highest points total, best league finish and the ultimate record: first time in the Premier League.\nAll this was achieved on a relatively small budget, with the arrival of Callum Wilson for around \u00a33m their big summer outlay. The majority of the squad were the players that helped achieve promotion from League One.\n\"This is the best Bournemouth side I have seen going back to 1986,\" former Cherries defender John Williams told BBC Sport. \"I speak to fans of 50 and 60 years and they say they have never seen such dynamic football.\"\nThe Cherries recorded an annual turnover of \u00a35.1m in their last official financial results. The figure is about to be dwarfed by the riches awaiting them in the Premier League.\nThe club lost \u00a315.3m in the financial year ending July 2013 and in total, their net debt is just over \u00a315.5m. They only just passed Financial Fair Play regulations earlier this season.\n\"A prudent estimate for a newly-promoted club is upwards of \u00a3120m,\" Sheffield Hallam University football finance expert Rob Wilson told BBC Sport.\n\"We are looking at a figure of anywhere between \u00a3100-\u00a3120m in terms of the value of promotion and the lion's share of that will come from television broadcasting. Depending on how well the club can leverage commercial and sponsorship opportunities you are talking about another \u00a320m.\"\nMaking the most of such opportunities might be a challenge for the Cherries, particularly since no club has ever been in the Premier League with a smaller stadium.\nAnd if they are to survive in the top flight, Howe may want to break the club's transfer record. That was set last summer when Wilson, who has gone on to score 23 times this season, joined from Coventry.\nA busy summer awaits on the south coast.", "output": "Bournemouth - home to pensioners, piers, pantos and, from next season, Premier League football.", "category": "Summarization 416.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an article.

Third Energy has already been extracting gas from the area using conventional methods.\nThe recent planning application related to the method of extraction of gas from the ground and therefore won't require the building of a lot of new infrastructure.\nProf Glover from Leeds University says the potential value to the local economy from the industry would come further down the line.\n\"Its really speculative to try and put a precise figure on the numbers of local jobs that could be created,\" he says.\n\"Only when companies start building new wells will we see jobs created, but those will be well paid and highly skilled.\n\"Every year universities like mine turn out graduates with all the right skills to work in the fracking industry and if there is a new supply of local jobs that will bring benefits to the whole Yorkshire economy.\"\nAccountancy firm EY predicts that, if the fracking industry was to take off, about 4,000 wells across the country could be supporting an additional 64,500 jobs by 2032.\nThere are others though who sound a more cautionary note.\n\"We still don't know if the gas under the ground is commercially viable,\" says Craig Stevens, a senior oil and gas manager at the accountancy firm PwC.\n\"We know that's there's a lot of it but until someone gets the permission to extract it we're not really sure if this industry is as viable as the fracking industry in the United States has been.\"\nThe fracking industry has transformed the US energy market. The latest estimates suggest that amount of shale gas and oil now being pumped from wells across the States has allowed the US to become energy-independent, meaning it no longer has to import gas and oil to meet its energy needs.\nHowever, a global slump in energy prices has caused the US industry to contract in the past year, with shale companies closing wells because of the falling wholesale price of gas and oil.\nMr Stevens says at this stage it's too soon to compare the potential of the UK industry with the realities of the US fracking business.\n\"The debate about the UK shale industry is more about emotion and winning hearts and minds rather than pure economics,\" he says. \"In the short term we're only going to be guessing as to what the potential economic benefits of the industry may be.\"\nAnd when it comes to arguments about the longer-term economic impact of fracking, opponents point out there is a risk of causing irreversible damage to the county's most important industry of tourism.\nFlamingo Land, a major local attraction, has said it fears tourism in the area would be \"negatively affected permanently\" if fracking were to go ahead.\nNorth Yorkshire has already been the legal and environmental testing ground for whether the physical extraction of shale gas within the UK can be achieved.\nThe county now faces the prospect of becoming an economic testing ground as well.", "output": "The first fracking operation in England since a ban was lifted in 2012 has been approved at a site close to the North York Moors National Park.", "category": "Summarization 416.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an article.

People who worked in fishing had to find jobs in other industries which proved more difficult to find.\nOil spills in the Ogoniland region have also contaminated local drinking water sources, seeping into groundwater, according to a report from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Toxins found by UNEP in the wider Ogoniland area's drinking water include benzene, which is thought to cause cancer.\nThe two spills came from the same pipe on the Trans Niger Pipeline, operated by Shell, which takes oil from its fields to the export terminal at Bonny on the coast. It carries about 180,000 barrels of oil per day. The firm disputes the size of the spills and says much of the oil was spilt as a result of thefts and sabotage.\nIn September 2006 - two years before the spills - a letter from Basil Omiyi, managing director of Shell's Nigeria business, SPDC, to the governor of Rivers State said that the pipeline was of \"immediate and utmost concern\".\nShell had not inspected the pipeline for several years due to difficulties in accessing it, he said.\n\"There is a risk and likelihood of rupture on this pipeline at any time, which if it happens, could have serious consequences for the safety of life, the environment and the nation's economy.\"\n\u2022 Shell stopped drilling oil in Ogoniland, which includes Bodo, in 1993 after growing unrest in the area.\n\u2022 In 2009 Shell paid $15.5m in an out-of-court settlement in a case accusing it of complicity in human rights abuses in Nigeria. It was brought by relatives of nine anti-oil campaigners, including author Ken Saro-Wiwa, who were hanged in 1995 by Nigeria's then military rulers. Shell denied any wrongdoing and said the payment was part of a \"process of reconciliation\"\n\u2022 In 2013, Shell produced 265,000 barrels of oil per day from Nigeria, which is 8.3% of the 3.2m barrels of oil per day it had for sale from its drilling business.\n\u2022 The area is also one of the most cost-effective for Shell. The cost of producing a barrel of oil in Africa last year was $14.43. Only Asia and Oceania were cheaper. In Europe and the USA, the cost was $17.66 and $21.57\n\u2022 Shell told its investors in its 2013 annual report of the \"disputes\" in Nigeria, where it \"believes that the outcomes of these matters will ultimately be resolved in a manner favourable to Shell\" albeit with the caveat \"no assurance can be provided\"\nA study conducted in 2000 by Shell's Nigeria business and Shell Global Solutions International, the oil giant's consulting business, found \"the remaining life of most of the SPDC oil trunklines is more or less non-existent or short, while some sections contain major risk and hazard.\"\nAn internal Shell email in December 2009, after the spills, said the firm was \"corporately exposed as the pipelines in Ogoniland have not been maintained properly or integrity assessed for over 15 years.\"\n\"The decision by Shell to continue pumping oil through pipelines which they knew were not fit for purpose is quite shocking,\" said Martyn Day, a senior partner at Leigh Day, the lawyers representing the community filing the claim.\n\"The result was an environmental catastrophe for the Bodo Community and the biggest loss of mangrove habitat in the history of oil spills.  The 40,000 residents of the Bodo Community primarily relied on fishing and their way of life and source of livelihoods has been destroyed for years to come,\" said Mr Day.\nShell, in documents submitted in its defence, admits its pipeline failed due to a faulty weld, but disputes the volume of spilled oil. It says much of the damage caused to the area comes from other spills, including damage from sabotage and attempts at theft.\nShell will pay \"just and reasonable\" compensation to those affected, it says.\nShell told the BBC: \"SPDC ceased operations in Ogoniland in 1993 following a rise in violence, threats to staff and attacks on facilities. Levels of violence and criminality have remained high over the following 21 years, constraining SPDC's ability to access the area.\n\"The condition of the pipeline is regularly assessed.\n\"Also, SPDC has always made use of the opportunity presented during sabotage [and] crude theft point leak repairs to carry out on-the-spot coating and internal checks to confirm the integrity of the pipeline and coating.\"\nThe claimants, who are suing for a clean-up plus damages, say the illegal refining only started in earnest after the spills, which killed the fish they rely on for food and their livelihoods.\nThe area's humidity corrodes pipelines and its many rivers and lowlands means fixing a leak often necessitates wading through swamps, carrying floating booms and other equipment, which is slow work, according to one former Shell employee with whom the BBC spoke.\nInternational industry rules call for operators to consider tools to detect corrosion in pipelines, leak detection equipment and so-called cathodic protection in environments where corrosion is a risk. This is where a structure, such as a pipeline, is protected from corrosion by an electric current.\nThere are no leak detection systems or flow rate meters on the pipeline, say the members of the community - systems which are industry standard in the West.\nShell was unable to use its other leak detection systems such as flow monitoring or acoustic sensors because they were sabotaged or stolen and it was \"not reasonable to keep replacing such equipment,\" it said.\nThe claimants say the pipelines were not checked regularly for corrosion or failing welding by robots known in the industry as intelligent pipeline inspection gadgets, or PIGs. In the UK, pipelines would be inspected in this way every five years or so, according to industry experts.\nShell says it employed contractors to guard and monitor the pipeline and arranged for inspections from the air. The claimants say a lack of boats and too few people to adequately patrol made their job \"inadequate\".\nThe claimants say Shell didn't want to shut down the pipes that form the Trans Niger Pipeline because of the company's reliance on them, citing an internal Shell email which says \"sustenance/stability via the TNP [pipeline] is key for our survival\".\n\"From all we have seen in pursuing the Bodo claims, Shell has demonstrated a very worrying lack of care when it comes to the operation of their pipelines in the Niger Delta,\" said Mr Day, the community's lawyer.\nShell said: \"We are in the process of preparing for a trial in May 2015 regarding the Bodo operational spills, at which time internal documents produced by SPDC relating to the Trans Niger Pipeline (TNP) will be set in their proper context for review by the court.\"", "output": "Oil firm Royal Dutch Shell was told a pipeline had reached the end of its life years before it spilled up to 500,000 barrels of oil, according to court documents seen by the BBC.", "category": "Summarization 416.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an article.

Kettering, Nottingham and Sheffield; and Windermere and Oxenholme.\nHe says new \"bi-mode\" trains, which can transfer seamlessly from electric to diesel power, mean there is no need to spend money on \"difficult\" work to fit Victorian tunnels and track with overhead power cables.\nNetwork Rail has promised the bi-mode trains will \"deliver faster, longer, more frequent and more reliable services across the north of England, from Newcastle, Hull and York towards Manchester and Liverpool via Leeds\" by 2022.\nWhen the plan was to electrify the entire line, estimates were made of improved journey times, with the 50 minute to an hour's trip from Manchester to Leeds predicted to be cut by 15 minutes.\nBut Network Rail has declined to issue new estimates for \"bi-mode\" journey times until it has completed a \"scoping exercise\" on the different options, which it will deliver to the Department for Transport in December.\nBi-mode trains, such as those built by Hitachi Rail at Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, are capable of running at 140mph in electric mode, although they will initially be limited to 125mph.\nThey tend to be heavier than electric-only or diesel-only trains, which can hamper acceleration on routes with steep gradients such as the Leeds to Manchester route.\nBut Hitachi said its bi-mode trains are just 5% heavier and have more power and better acceleration rates than the trains they are replacing.\nJourney times will depend on how many stops the trains make and the route they take.\nThink tank IPPR North is urging the government to commit to a high speed all-electric rail link between Manchester and Leeds, that would dramatically cut journey times, as part of a broader Northern Powerhouse Rail programme.\nThey are also calling for \u00a359bn in \"catch up cash\" over the next 10 years to fund schemes drawn up by Transport for North, an alliance of local authorities and business groups, as well as new powers for the group to raise private finance.\nIPPR North director Ed Cox said: \"Businesses and commuters in the north have been outraged by recent government announcements about transport in the north [of England], so much so that over 50,000 people have signed our online petition demanding fresh commitments to transport spending and devolution.\n\"This is not simply about fairness, it's about unlocking the potential of the northern economy and finally realising that northern prosperity is national prosperity.\"\nBusiness groups are expected to step up their lobbying of ministers at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester at the start of October.\nDamian Waters, the CBI's North West director, said: \"It's vital that projects in different parts of the country are not seen as 'either or'.\n\"Improving the north of England's infrastructure should come at the same time as enhancements in the south.\"\nRail union the TSSA is also running a Rally for Rail campaign, calling on the government to reverse the decision to cancel electrification in northern England, Midlands and Wales, which has been backed by Labour MPs and regional development organisations.\nA Department for Transport spokesman said the government was committed to improving journey times and connecting communities in the north of England.\n\"Major upgrades to the Manchester - Leeds - York route are currently being designed and developed, to enable us to deliver more improvements for rail passengers from 2022.\n\"We are also working with the region to develop plans for Northern Powerhouse Rail, which aims to dramatically improve journey times between the major cities of the north.\n\"Passengers expect high quality rail services and we are committed to electrification where it delivers benefits, but will also take advantage of new technology to improve journeys.\"", "output": "Transport Secretary Chris Grayling risked turning himself into a hate figure for train passengers in the north of England, Wales and the Midlands when he ditched long-promised rail electrification schemes last month.", "category": "Summarization 416.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an article.

They have 10 in total, which is a fantastic achievement.\nThe same principle applies at the top of the Premier League too, where some clubs seem to see finishing second, third or fourth as a \"win\".\nThe main reason I think Manchester United will win the title this season is because they have signed proven winners like Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Paul Pogba and finishing first is all that matters to their manager Jose Mourinho too.\nMourinho knows how to achieve it because he has done it so many times before. I believe his winning experience in the Premier League will be the defining difference between him and Pep Guardiola this season, although it is a difficult one to call.\nI saw a quote recently from tennis world number one Serena Williams about how she hates losing more than she loves winning, and I can definitely relate to that.\nSometimes the fear of losing acts as a motivator for me to do all that I can - within the rules - to win and when you have that kind of desire it is not always easy to deal with defeat.\nI saw that this week with one of my former team-mates, United States goalkeeper Hope Solo, after her side were knocked out of the Olympic tournament on penalties by Sweden in the quarter-finals.\nHope already has two Olympic gold medals and is the most decorated goalkeeper, male or female, playing in the world.\nShe is a serial winner and one of the reasons she has had the career she has is that she is one of the best winners - and worst losers - that I know.\nHope is known for being outspoken too, and I think her criticism of Sweden after the game -  referring to them as \"cowards\" because of their tactics - was regrettable to say the least.\nPart of the reason she said what she did was because of when she was interviewed. I am not defending or excusing her but I do appreciate how difficult it must have been to speak straight after a high intensity, highly emotional match.\nBut I think her comments represent someone who was so driven by her desire to win that it was difficult to be gracious in defeat too. I guess not everyone can be a serial winner and gracious loser all at the same time.\nAnother indication of that were her delaying tactics during the shoot-out against Sweden, when she changed her gloves just before Lisa Dahlkvist scored the decisive penalty.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nMany people saw it as unsporting behaviour but I believe that if Dahlkvist had missed after having to wait so long to take her penalty, then Solo would have been applauded for her tactics.\nBy distracting her opponent, she was doing whatever it took within the rules to win and although I commend and endorse sporting behaviour, I also know that winning at the elite level doesn't always involve niceties.\nSweden also beat Brazil on penalties in their semi-final and will play Germany in the Olympic final.\nI am hoping my team-mate at Chelsea, Sweden goalkeeper Hedvig Lindahl, will bring home the gold, and she is another player who I know wants nothing less.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nAs I have written in previous columns, it is a huge shame that politics meant the Great Britain men's and women's football teams were not at Rio 2016.

What an incredible story for women in sport of all ages.\nThe Women's Super League season resumes at the end of August and although we have not had any games recently in the last few weeks, I have been really enjoying training with Chelsea and look forward to what is now the business end of the season with six league games to go.\nA lot of our other players are away on international duty at the moment so I have been able to do more individual work - a lot of shooting and finishing - and the coaches have more one to one time to coach me individually.\nI was not selected for the latest England squad for their training camp this week but I am very happy with the way I am performing.\nI am currently the top-scoring English striker in the WSL with seven goals in all competitions and I hope to keep scoring and assisting goals and performing well to help Chelsea to win our remaining league games.\nLike all the gold-winning Olympians, winning the league and retaining our FA WSL trophy is what I have in mind - I am not targeting second place.\nEngland and Chelsea forward Eniola Aluko was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.", "output": "There has been a fascinating debate during these Olympics about what winning and losing means to the competing athletes at Rio 2016.", "category": "Summarization 416.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an article.

Because there's way too much hairspray in this arena for that to go on for long\"\nHungary - After all that drama, Hungary's delicate and soulful ballad comes as something of a relief. Boggie's Wars for Nothing is an acoustic number which builds up vocally as she's joined by four harmonising backing singers.\nIt's got a traditional Eurovision peace message (clue is in the title) which could go in its favour. Again, it's all about the voices but there is a very impressive constellations image projected on to the floor during the first half of the song. Thank goodness for aerial cameras.\nGeorgia - Nina Sublatti has a strong voice and she looks pretty scary as she belts out her anthem Warrior wearing a Goth-style leather jumpsuit with thigh high boots. And she's taken epaulettes to a whole new level - frankly, it looks like two ravens are poking out of her capped sleeves.\nShe says her song is about feminism, Georgian women's history, and honesty. Good on her. And it's another entry that's offering something different from the pop and ballads on offer. I just wouldn't want to be the one to tell her she hasn't won.\nAzerbaijan - Hour of the Wolf isn't a bad song but I'm afraid I was so distracted by the contemporary dancers  in harem pants swirling around Elnur Huseynov that it's hard to comment. And one of them was bare-chested, shock, horror.\nBut I do recall it had a hint of Hozier about it, at least in the verses. It's not Elnur's first time at Eurovision - in 2003, as part of duo Elnur & Samir, he came eighth. I'm not sure he'll be able to top that tonight.\nRussia - Polina Gagarina's A Million Voices is now one of the favourites to win. Some commentators in Vienna feel it sticks in the craw a little, given the song's message of peace and tolerance opposite Russia's handling of the crisis in Ukraine and its anti-gay stance. But that's not Polina's fault.\nThe song is very Eurovision and although she looks a bit nervous, her voice doesn't suffer for it. It will be some turnaround if Russia do take the Eurovision crown after last year's entry was booed by some members of the audience.\nAlbania  - Gosh, this was a hard one to sing. The notes are all over the shop.  Elhaida Dani gives it a good crack though. The staging could have been a bit more interesting.\nAgain, not a bad song but it's probably going to get lost in the penultimate spot, especially sandwiched between big hitters Russia and Italy.\nItaly - any Il Divo fans out there? You're going to love Il Volo. Some think the fact it's sung in Italian could go against it but it's a beautiful language so I can't see it myself. Simple staging for this trio - the music speaks for itself.\nIt's been a favourite for months and should feature highly even if it doesn't win. I doubt the boys will be too bothered if they don't - they've already sold one million records and collaborated with Placido Domingo and Barbra Streisand.\nMontenegro - This is only Montengro's second appearance in a Eurovision final. Knez is a huge star in his home nation and his Eurovision entry Adio has a traditional regional feel, featuring a folky instrumental opening that transports you straight to the shores of the Adriatic.\nAnd actually, that's no bad thing. A bit of old school Eurovision never hurt anyone. We were also treated to some traditional dancing with his five lovely backing singers. What's not to like?\nGermany - Sophie Ann stepped into the breach when the contestant that won the selection contest in Germany earlier this year shocked presenters by telling them he didn't want to go to Eurovision after all.\nSo instead of Andreas Kummert's acoustic ballad, we get to hear Black Smoke, a funky number from a singer who grew up in Hamburg, was born in London and studied in New York. How very international.\nThe song isn't unpleasant but it all feels just a little bit dated. And she spends the entire first verse with her back to the audience - how rude. \"We're only left with black smoke,\" Sophie Ann smoulders. I'm still worrying about that piano.\nPoland's entry, Monika Kuszynska, was very emotional about getting through to this year's final. She was in a rock pop band who were involved in a serious car accident in 2006, which left her paralysed from the waist down. \"Sometimes we can only see the dark side but many beautiful things can go with a terrible event,\" she said after making it through the second semi-final.\nIn the Name of Love is another ballad, written by Monika herself, about how she overcame the trauma she suffered. The melody is pretty run-of-the-mill but it's hard not to feel moved by the sincere performance. And she blows a little kiss to the audience at the end. Nice touch.\nLatvia - This is very different to everything else on offer and has polarised opinion here in the Austrian capital. Aminata's Love Injected is an electro ballad, which the 22-year-old penned herself. I reckon Aminata could be Latvia's answer to La Roux. She certainly sounds like Elly Jackson, particularly during the verses.\nAminata is wearing a red dress that wouldn't look out of place on Diana Ross but she does own the stage (I'm back in Cowell mode). And she should be applauded for entering something unusual.\nRomania - Yet another pared-down set, this time for Romanian artist Voltaj with his song De La Capat (All Over Again). The stage is scattered with strategically placed suitcases though. Is he hoping to make a quick getaway? But I like the way he chops and changes between Romanian and English throughout his performance.\nThe song is about supporting children whose parents have to leave their homeland to work abroad and he finishes with a message to the audience: \"Don't leave the children behind\". Er, I think he might be aiming this at me. Kids, I'll be back from Vienna on Sunday. Promise.\nSpain - now this, folks, would be just another ballad if it wasn't for the costume gimmicks! Bring it on! Edurne - David de Gea's girlfriend for the footy fans amongst you - starts off by climbing over a man lying on the stage. Good start. And it gets better. So she's wearing a red evening dress with a Kylie-style snood hood that she pushes back before launching into the strong chorus.\nMeanwhile, the long train of her dress is billowing behind her thanks to a bit of wind machine action and the man who was lying on the floor has recovered himself sufficiently to pull the train, resulting in Edurne's dress flying off to reveal a glittery gold number underneath!\nI was worried there might be a Madonna moment as he tugged on the train but they must have sensibly opted for Velcro. Well, it worked of Buck's Fizz. Not only that, there are also some ambitious dance lifts a la Strictly (Len would definitely NOT approve).\nCyprus - John Karayiannis says his influences are Ed Sheeran and John Mayer, although to be honest, you wouldn't know it by listening to his Eurovision entry, One Thing I Should Have Done. Personally, I think he sounds more like Will Young. This is probably the most traditional ballad in the contest.\nIt does have quite an old-fashioned feel so maybe that's why the first verse was broadcast in black and white. Members of the audience wave their obligatory phone torches in time to the music and John looks like he's about to cry by the end of the song. Oh dear. John says his eyesight is so bad he can't see further than the end of his nose but he has 9 spare pairs so he should be alright.\nAustralia - This is the perfect antidote to Cyprus (no offence but there are a LOT of ballads in this year's contest). This year's wildcard has split opinion in terms of whether it should have been allowed to enter but lighten up people! The Aussies love Eurovision and this is a really decent pop song from established artist, Guy Sebastian.\nWe're not quite sure why he's got the M6 backdrop behind him - it's not saying exotic Gold Coast to me - but we're loving the jaunty hat and the dancing's not bad either. Tonight Again could land top five.\nBelgium - Loic Nottet came second in the 2013 Belgium version of The Voice as part of BJ Scott and this entry, Rhythm Inside, is a bold effort and has more than a touch of Lorde's hit Royals about it. Australian artist Sia recently re-tweeted Loic's version of her hit Chandelier, which must say something.\nThere's a teetering pirouette in the middle which looks pretty risky plus one of the dancers appears to be doing a floor workout gym-style for some inexplicable reason. The track might be too cool and edgy for Eurovision's audience but it made it through the first semi-final so watch this space.\nAustria - Conchita is a hard act to follow and this year's Austrian act has been somewhat in the shadow of the 'Queen of Austria' this week in Vienna. Rock band The MakeMakes are giving it a good crack with their song We Are Yours!\nIt's pretty low key after the whirlwind that was Conchita but they certainly haven't disgraced themselves on the big stage in front of a home crowd. And they do all have facial hair to keep the beard theme going. And we have another gimmick - woo hoo! The piano is set on fire! Er, health and safety anyone? Where are the EU regulations when you need them?\nGreece - Phew. They've either put out the piano fire or they've wheeled in another for Maria Elena Kyriacou's  entry, One Last Breath. This is another typical Eurovision ballad, with a predictable 80s-style drum beat joining in for the second verse.\nShe's got a fine pair of lungs on her though and the wind machine is in full action as she builds up to the finale. Maria Elena co-wrote the song herself. Before winning a Greek talent show, she was a professor so at least that's something to fall back on if the wind doesn't blow in her favour (sorry!)\nArmenia - Genealogy, had to change their song title from Don't Deny to Face the Shadow after it was deemed too political by the powers that be with its apparent reference to the mass killings of Armenians by Ottoman Turks 100 years ago. Not quite sure what the point was given the lyrics remain unchanged.\nBut anyway, it's a powerful rock ballad sung by a six-strong group, featuring opera-style warbling plus your more standard pop voices. There's some pretty impressive harmonies here, too.\nLithuania's upbeat This Time comes from yet another male/female duo, Monika Linkyte and Vaidas Baumila. The song can certainly hold its own and there's a three-second kiss between the pair midway through the performance which seems to go down very well with the audience. There's definitely chemistry there.\nSerbia's entry has the perfect ingredients for a Eurovision hit. Big diva voice, spooky dancers with masks who strip off to reveal new costumes, reminiscent of Bucks Fizz, and an \"I am what I am\" message from its plus-size singer, Bojana Stamenov. Beauty Never Lies starts off as a ballad before building into a classic Euro discobeat dance track that is sending audiences wild in Vienna.\nAnd hats off to the backing vocalists/dancers for presenting the chorus in sign language while leaping around the stage. This could be a surprise winner.\nNorway's entry is a real grower and duo Morland and Debrah Scarlett have to be one of the coolest acts in this year's final. Some songs don't need gimmicks and this is one of them. Their song, A Monster Like Me, is creeping up in the betting odds and it's a really hard one to call - it could be too slow for voters hearing it for the first time and it's not typical Eurovision fare. Then again, that could work in their favour.\nKjetil Morland comes from southern Norway but has spent most of his adult life in the UK, after moving there to study. This of course explains his very English accent which threw me off guard in yesterday's press conference. So worth cheering them on along with Electro Velvet if you like the UK connection. (Don't tell anyone but this is my favourite).\nSweden is favourite to win this year's contest with Mans Zelmerlow's Heroes and it's not hard to see why. The Aviici-style track is being belted out by Eurovision fans across Vienna (including on a tram last night on the way back the press centre) but its trump card is the stunning background graphics.\nThe innovative and interactive projections wouldn't look out of place at the Brits or Grammys. Whether the graphics should be as important a factor as the song itself is a debate that will no doubt rumble on should Sweden win.\nSlovenia - This was a slick opening performance from married duo Marjetka and Raay. Their act is called Maraaya, a combination of... you've got it, Marjetka and Raay. Here For You has a genuine contemporary edge with a catchy chorus that should see it do well tonight. And it can't be easy kicking off a show watched by nearly 200m people on TV.\nNot sure if the huge headphones paired with a wedding dress is a good look but anything goes at Eurovision.  Their act also features a very energetic dancer playing an imaginary violin, plus Raay making love with the camera from his piano seat. Whatever floats your boat.\nFrance - Not one act who has been placed second in the line-up at Eurovision has ever won. So it's a tough ask for France's Lisa Angell. Let's hope her lucky routine is in place - when her daughter is backstage with her, Lisa kisses her on the forehead and if she's not there, she keeps a picture of her close by. Bless.\nLisa's a fantastic and powerful singer live but I can't see this ballad doing the business, despite the men in uniform flanking her on either side. It's one of the few entries this year to be sung in a native tongue, titled N'oubliez Pas. Or Don't Forget. Sorry Lisa, we just might.\nIsrael - Golden Boy, Nadav Guedj, certainly lives up to his name here in the press centre. They absolutely love the 16-year-old bundle of energy who intends to prove he's \"the king of fun\". For his tender years, he oozes confidence and totally owns the stage (I'm channelling my inner Simon Cowell).\nAnd check out his bling winged gold trainers. His track covers all angles, starting off with a ballad-like solo which morphs into a Justin Timberlake-style dance track before it leads into a Middle Eastern-influenced chorus. Hold on to your hats.\nEstonia - Elina Born and Stig Rasta certainly have their country behind them - they picked up 79% of the vote from Estonian TV viewers in the selection contest. Goodbye to Yesterday has some pretty odd lyrics in places (\"I'm all alone, lying here naked waiting by the phone\" for starters). Songwriter Stig rarely sings himself, he usually just writes for other people. And you can tell.\nDon't get me wrong, he can hold a tune but Elina definitely has the stronger voice. However, the song is strong and the pair will be hoping for a second win for Estonia in Vienna. The piece de resistance is a clever illusion which sees Stig \"disappear\" into thin air at the end of the performance. Hurrah, the first real gimmick of the night!\nUnited Kingdom - Rolling Stones tribute act singer Alex Larke and vocalist Bianca Nicholas are really enjoying the ride here in Vienna. Their song, Still In Love With You, has been the subject of much debate on social media and Alex himself has described it as a \"Marmite\" song i.e. you either love it or hate it. But it's a fun ditty and in a Eurovision Song Contest sadly lacking in gimmicks this year, Electro Velvet's performance should stand out.\nKeep your eye on those costumes, that's all I'm saying. Not to mention Bianca's fabulous hair extensions and some pyrotechnics for good measure. Don't forget, Sandie Shaw won in Vienna in 1967 with Puppet On A String. Let's hope it's a good omen.\nThe show is being hosted by three women, Mirjam Weichselbraun, Alice Tumler and Arabella Kiesbauer but Conchita is clearly the lady of the moment as she pops up out of a podium in a sparkling pink number - and now the 'Queen of Austria' is flying across the stage!\nAll the contestants walk up to the stage surrounded by their respective flags.\nI'll be giving you my thoughts on each entry.\nThe show is just about to start, and the noise has really ramped up in the last 15 minutes or so. We'll be lucky to hear the performances at this rate!\nAnd if you're having a party, get in touch with Graham Norton and he might just give you a shout-out.\nSo hold on tight, here we go...\nOnce more unto the breach, dear friends, once more - I've arrived at the press centre and will be here for the duration.\nJust before leaving the hotel, I saw Electro Velvet dashing back out, presumably on their way to the arena.\nAnd I literally bumped into Graham Norton as I came out of the lift - or should I say, he bumped into me. He looked in a bit of a rush. For your information, the beard is looking well-groomed ahead of the final.\nOn the way to the arena, I passed dozens of fans streaming out after the final dress rehearsal, soaked to the skin.\nIt's rained pretty much solidly since I arrived - I bet the sun comes out tomorrow just as I board the plane.\nFlags are flying already inside the press room and elbows are out. A French radio station has already stuck its label on the BBC's allocated table. This could be war!\nOn a lighter note, I've just been introduced to Terry Vision - a puppet who is a reporter for unofficial Eurovision website ESC Insight.\nHmmm. Do you think he might be based on someone closer to home with a strong Eurovision association?\nEurovision fans, it's the day you've been waiting for - the grand final!\nIt's raining here in Vienna (just for a change) but that isn't dampening anyone's spirits.\nI've just spotted Alex from Electro Velvet in the hotel foyer looking relaxed ahead of the final dress rehearsal this afternoon and the place is swarming with fans - I bumped into several members of one unofficial fan club from London who did an impromptu dance routine in the hotel reception complete with LED light gloves, presumably in honour of Electro Velvet's illuminating stage show.\nNot to mention their specially made T-shirts carrying the slogan: \"Sounding Good, Sugar\", a line from Still In Love With You.\nThe bookies' odds have made interesting reading during the week, with fluctuations aplenty following each semi-final.\nAccording to Oddschecker this morning, which compiles all the big bookmakers, Sweden are still out in front, followed by Russia - who have edged past Italy, now lying in third.\nBelgium and Australia are also in the running.\nElectro Velvet are somewhere in the middle.\nBut who knows? Last year, it was predicted that the UK would claim a top five place but we ended up coming a disappointing 17th.\nThe Eurovision experts here in Vienna have also been sharing their thoughts about how it might go tonight.\nPaul Jordan, best known as Dr Eurovision, told me: \"Sweden is one to watch, they usually do well.\n\"It's not the best song but it's contemporary and his performance is really innovative.\n\"Russia could do well. Given the wider political context it will be interesting to watch the reaction for this [they were booed last year].\"\nThat's unlikely to happen this year, though.\nAccording to The Moscow Times, Eurovision organisers have \"sound-reducing\" technology at the ready to silence the audience should any booing occur this evening.\nIn Copenhagen last year, Russia's Tolmachevy Twins were repeatedly booed, although they ended up in seventh place.\nThe pair took the flak for their mother country's stance on Ukraine and Russia's record on gay rights.\nWe'll find out tonight if Russia's entry this year, Polina Gagarina, with her song about tolerance and peace, will suffer the same fate.\nJust bumped into Kathrin Zechner, director of television at ORF, Austria's state broadcaster.\nShe was responsible for choosing Conchita to represent Austria at last year's contest and is in charge of the show's production.\n\"We went for the most challenging and she has a wonderful voice. She is so laidback and wise for her age.\n\"I told her to present six songs and Phoenix just stood out.\"\n\"Tears, happiness and pride! When they said Austria was in the lead, I nearly fainted!\"\n\"The theme of the eye is about the vision of life and keeping an eye on the people around you.\n\"We've put the green room in the middle of the room, so it's really part of the show, as are the audience.\n\"The Building Bridges theme is about diversity, between old and young, women and men, different races, sexuality.\n\"I'm the only female director on my board, so that's my focus. Men will never give a place to women for free, you really have to push.\n\"We wanted three Austrians who are multi-lingual, from different ethnic groups. They're all professionals and all working mums.\"\n\"Keep an eye on your neighbour, Austria is a great place to visit and we built the longest, sparkly bridge - to Australia and back!\"\nWe're all a bit bleary-eyed in the press centre this morning after the semi-final last night but thankfully, one of the BBC producers has come armed with PG Tips to keep us going. I managed to grab UK hopefuls Electro Velvet for a quick chat ahead of the first dress rehearsal for the final.\nBianca: \"We just can't wait to get up there. The nerves are starting to come a little, but that's a good thing. It just means that you care a lot about it.\"\nAlex: \"I think we'll be quite pumped on the night, there'll be a lot of adrenaline!\"\nBianca: \"All that stuff is totally outside of our control. If you focus on where you're going to come, how you're doing in the odds, it can distract you from the performance which is the most important thing.\"\nAlex: \"We've put ourselves in our own little bubble, so we're not communicating with the outside world. We're just getting on with making sure our performance is tip top and then hopefully the rest will fall into place.\"\nBianca:  \"I hope we'll feel on top of the world and feel proud of what we've done wherever we come.\"\nAlex:  \"There might be a glass of wine!\"\nBianca: \"We're quite lucky we're on early so we can then enjoy everyone else's performances. We've made some really good friends, it's like one big family. So we'll get to see some of our friends' performances and we're rooting for them, too.\"\nAlex: \"We did a little stint on the ukulele (at last night's semi-final). When they announced the UK, the place went nuts - it's been great, it lifted me.\"\nBianca: \"It's so nice that a complete stranger wants to approach you and wish you good luck. It's really encouraging.\"\nBianca: \"Eurovision is very fan-led, the staging is getting better and better and we're using state-of-the-art technology in our performance, it's just moving with the times.\"\nMore and more fans are descending on the Austrian capital as Grand Final day looms and I caught up with Mike and Louise, a couple from Nottingham, who are first-timers at Eurovision.\nMichael: \"We wanted to come to Vienna anyway so we thought, 'let's kill two birds with one stone'. We're more festival-goers really, we're off to the Isle of Wight later this year. It took us two days to get here because Louise doesn't fly!\nMike:  \"I think it's OK, I think it was wrong to put in the old has-beens - Englebert and Bonnie - in it.\nLouise: \"Electro Velvet were just put together for this, it's just one record and we might not hear from them again.\"\nMike:  \"We went to the first semi-final. Most of the songs were big ballads or very poppy and I think Electro Velvet have been quite clever, it's slightly off-beat.\nLouise: \"I think the song's catchy.\"\nMike:  \"They played it live in the auditorium and it came across OK with the sound system beefing it up.\"\nLouise: \"Everyone was cheering. You can never tell!\"\nLouise: \"It's me really! It's always been there since you were young. In the last 8-10 years it's changed again, young people are having parties. In England we always know we're never going to win. Good bands don't want to be part of it.\"\nMichael: \"If Take That or Blur entered, they wouldn't win... It's all political.\"\nLouise: \"I love Italy but having seen Serbia, I think with the lyrics, the big ballad start-off and then the beat, it's got all the ingredients.\nMichael: The Australian one was good. That's a good pop song.\nSo we now have the order of the 26 acts in grand final. The UK is in fifth - Alex from Electro Velvet told me just now he was pleased with the slot, adding that many of the upbeat songs are in the first half. They are sandwiched between a strong track from Estonia and Armenia's moody protest ballad. France had better start worrying though - no-one who is second in the line-up has ever won Eurovision. Here's the list in full.\n1.Slovenia\n2.France\n3.Israel\n4.Estonia\n5.United Kingdom\n6.Armenia\n7.Lithuania\n8.Serbia\n9.Norway\n10.Sweden\n11.Cyprus\n12.Australia\n13.Belgium\n14.Austria\n15.Greece\n16.Montenegro\n17.Germany\n18.Poland\n19.Latvia\n20.Romania\n21.Spain\n22.Hungary\n23.Georgia\n24.Azerbaijan\n25.Russia\n26.Albania\n27.Italy\nAnd breathe... now we know the entire line-up for Saturday's grand final.\nThe biggest cheers went up in the press room for performances from Azerbijian, Montenegro, Slovenia, Israel, Norway and Sweden during the second semi-final - and that was reflected in the vote tonight, as they all went through.\nThey were joined by Lithuania, Poland - which seemed to be something of a surprise to some - Cyprus and Latvia.\nEveryone held their breath as they waited for the last act to land a place in the final -  and it went to Israel's 16-year-old Nadav Guedj.\nSadly, the other 16-year-olds in the competition - San Marino duo Michele Perniola and Anita Simoncini - will not be joining him.\nMultiple-Eurovision winner Ireland also missed the cut, as did Malta, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Switzerland and Iceland.\nI spoke to Eurovision expert John Kennedy O'Connor after the results were announced: \"Heartbreak of course in Ireland. It's 20 years now since their run of incredible Eurovision glory was halted and for the second year in a row, they didn't make the final.\n\"The poor Czechs were bounced out again and they are yet to ever appear on the final stage. San Marino of course disappointed and the youngest singers in the contest couldn't capitalise on their experience in the junior event last year.\"\nSo who is responsible for the outcome?\nViewers at home were able to vote in the semi-final if their country was performing in it. The UK are one of the \"Big Five\" who will go straight through to the final but Brits were allowed to vote on Thursday night.\nThe public determined half of the vote and the other half was down to the national juries of all the countries taking part or allocated to the semi-final.\nAs the results came through, the betting odds online began frantically changing before my eyes as we finally knew for definite who would be singing on Saturday night.\nRussia, Belgium and Serbia are looking good while Sweden and Italy are still the favourites. Australia, Estonia, and now Norway, could also be in the running.\nThere was a jubilant atmosphere at the press conference that followed the show - the losers and their supporters must have sneaked out the back.\nI think I was the only Brit among a sea of excitable Israelis surrounding me on all sides of the seating area, and it wasn't long before they broke into a spontaneous rendition of Guedj's Golden Boy.\nPoland's entry, Monika Kuszynska, was very emotional about getting through. She was in a rock pop band who were involved in a serious car accident in 2006, which left her paralysed from the waist down.\n\"I feel I've got something to say, a message to put in my songs. Sometimes we can only see the dark side but many beautiful things can go with a terrible event. I always look on the bright side, that's why I'm here.\"\nSweden's Mans Zelmerlow said he was feeling \"happy and relieved\" after going through  before admitting, \"I could have done some things better tonight. I was a bit rushed in the second verse, so I hope I'll be in the running to be champ!\"\nDon't worry Mans, you have three dress rehearsals before the big event to make it perfect.\nThere's a frisson in the air today in the Eurovision press centre as the 'Austrian Queen', aka Conchita, is in the house.\nHer press conference was crammed to the gills with journos and Eurovision superfan bloggers. She didn't disappoint, entering the room wearing a dress slit to the waist to the strains of her single You Are Unstoppable.\nWhat's it like hosting the green room at the semi-finals, ahead of Saturday's grand final?\n\"Three days ago I thought: 'Why would I agree on doing this? Last year, the last thing I wanted was for anyone to ask me how I felt! But I really do enjoy it, it's a new experience. I'm pushing my boundaries - I have just one minute and 48 seconds for each contestant.\"\nHow have you dealt with the fame that came with your win last year?\n\"I'm still not used to being a known person outside Austria. It's something I really appreciate.\"\nAnd you've written a book about your life already!\n\"I'm just 26, it was too early to write my memoirs - there weren't that many! But then we came up with a concept that everyone liked, a book that I myself would like - with many pictures!\"\nMidway through proceedings, the MD of Sony Records in Austria surprised Conchita with a platinum award for her self-titled album.\nConchita: \"What are you doing here? Am I fired? [Then] Thank you so much, gosh, that's unbelievable, thank you so much to my fans, that's huge.\"\nHow do you feel about Conchita lookalikes?\n\"I'm flattered people copy my look at carnivals etc - it's easy, a man just doesn't have to shave!\"\nWhy are you known now just as Conchita, not Conchita Wurst?\n\"I heard the only way you get an Oscar is to drop your surname!\"\nYou're a very positive person but some things must make you angry?\n\"Any negativity in the last year was about me and my character and I really don't care about other peoples' opinions.\nWith things in society - all I can do is reach as many people as possible through a camera and hopefully reach other people who have more influence than I do.\n\"I would love to meet President Putin. I would love to spend a week with him to understand what it's like to be President Putin, but I don't know if it's going to happen!\"\nDo you have a favourite in this year's contest?\n\"I do and I won't tell you!\"\nGuten morgen from Vienna.\nThe Australian fans are the big story at Eurovision this year, as Guy Sebastian vies to take the Eurovision crown beyond Europe's shores for the first time in the competition's history.\nI caught up with an Aussie family - mum, son and daughter - who had travelled from Queensland to join the party.\nSo what's brought you all the way from Australia?\nNick: \"We're here because Conchita won and we love Conchita.\"\nMichaela (mum):  \"I was born in Austria so for me, Conchita's win was a huge thing. That's why I had to come back and they came with me.\"\nHave you always been big Eurovision fans?\nMichaela: \"Yes. I used to make them sit and watch. I grew up with Eurovision in the '70s, so they just had to listen - there was no escape!\"\nHow did you feel when you found out that Australia were going to be part of the competition this year?\nEloise: \"It was pretty exciting as we were coming anyway.\"\nWhat do you think of Guy's song, Tonight Again?\nNick: \"I think he'll do really well, it's a good song, everyone likes it over here and he's a great performer. We voted for him when he was on Australian Idol.\"\nHave you had a good reception here in Vienna?\nEloise: \"Everyone loves Australians (we're kind of a novelty).\"\nMichaela: \"Everyone is friendly and we've come from afar. There have been mixed reactions to us being in it, but such is life.\"\nNick: \"They think it's kind of weird we've come all the way - it is a bit odd as we're not in Europe. I think a lot of people are perplexed as to why we love it so much.\"\nWhy do the Australians love Eurovision so much?\nNick: \"It's the immigrant population: Greeks, Italians, English, Austrian.\nMichaela: \"For the older generation, it's like a part of home for us. When we watch it, it brings Europe a bit closer. I think that's why a lot of the immigrants like it - and then their children either grow up liking it or hating it!\"\nAnd do you have any other Eurovision favourites this year?\nAll (in unison): \"Belgium, we love Belgium!\"\nAfter a whirlwind introduction to the craziness of the press room, we raced down to Vienna's beautiful City Hall Square - home to the Eurovision Village all this week. Crowds had gathered and the stage was set for the \"Big Five\" contestants (France, Italy, the UK, Germany, Spain) plus wildcard Australia to prove themselves ahead of Saturday's grand final.\nThe square was packed with fans from across the continent and beyond, despite the heavy rain which decided to make an appearance just as the bizarre warm-up acts - lindy hop and flamenco dancers anyone? - got going.\nGuy Sebastian was first up, receiving a raucous welcome, not least from a substantial group of Aussies who clearly felt it was worth the air fare and 24-hour flight to join the party.\n\"You guys are awesome for staying in the rain. We love Eurovision in Australia  and we are super-excited to be taking part.\"\nGuy chose to perform an acoustic rendition of Tonight Again, saying he wanted to save the full show for Saturday.\nFrench contestant Lisa Angell was up next, with one of the few Eurovision entries this year not to be sung in English, N'oubliez Pas (that's \"Don't Forget\" to me and you).\nSo does she want to win? \"If I want something, I want something,\" she said. \"If I want bread, I want bread, if I want cheese, I want cheese, so if I want to win, I want to win.\" Er, ok.\nIt was soon time for the Brits to cheer as Electro Velvet - Alex Larke and Bianca Nicholas - arrived, complete with the obligatory apology from Alex for \"bringing the weather with us\".\nWith the rain now streaming down, the lyrics \"Don't go out in the pouring rain / You might get wet, I'd be upset\" seemed just a little ironic.\nFor some reason, Germany's Ann Sophie wasn't present so we had to make do with the video that accompanies her track, Black Smoke.\nItaly and Spain rounded off the evening, with Italian trio Il Volo belting out their Il Divo-esque Grand Amore. It got the biggest ovation of the night and many here believe it's a serious contender for the Eurovision crown.\nSpain's Edurne then belted out her gutsy number Amanecer as the rain finally cleared up and the crowds began to disperse.\nSo I've made it into the frankly massive Eurovision press centre - 800 square metres with 800 separate work spaces.\nA dress rehearsal for tomorrow night's second semi-final is just about to begin. Nerves are jangling, as the elimination of PKN at last night's show proved no-one is safe.\nThe rehearsal is being beamed across the press centre on giant screens but, sadly, I'm not allowed to give you any updates - none of the rehearsals can be reported on.\nMeanwhile, Vienna itself has gone Eurovision crazy. The city's Madame Tussaud's now has a wax figure of last year's winner, Conchita Wurst, and there's even a display in the Leopold Museum titled Nul-Pointers.\nThe exhibition contains - you guessed it - a portrait of each of the 34 Eurovision participants whose performances did not earn them a single point. According to the museum, \"they represent icons of failure\".\nTalk about a back-handed compliment.\nEarlier, I spotted my first gay-themed pedestrian traffic light (see above). They were due to be removed in June but Maria Vassilakou, in charge of traffic issues in the local council, has said they will now remain.\nRight, it's time for me to hop off to the Euro Village to see the \"Big Five\" performing. I'll report back later.\nMalta's enigmatic singer Amber has been spreading the Eurovision message of peace and equality ahead of her performance at the second semi-final on Thursday.\nYesterday, she was seen sporting a \"Yes\" badge when she met Ireland's Molly Sterling in Vienna, to show her support for the marriage equality referendum - which takes place on Friday in Ireland. It's the world's first referendum on same sex marriage and is, of course, being closely followed by the many gay fans of Eurovision.\nEarlier today, Amber was spotted at Vienna's Learning Cafe, a free service for kids and teenagers from refugee families.\nAmber plans to become a primary school teacher after Eurovision, so at least she has something to fall back on should her song, Warrior, not make it through to the grand final.\nPress accreditation sorted, with much excitement surrounding the goody bags handed out to journalists - salami, sausages, you name it. Shame I'm vegetarian. Still, the chocolate and random shoe polish makes up for it.\nI've not even left the airport lounge yet and the first big shock of Eurovision 2015 has happened without me. PKN, Finland's hotly tipped and much-hyped punk outfit, failed to make it through the first semi-final last night.\nShame - their song made a change from the plethora of power ballads on offer this year (even if it wasn't that easy on the ear).\nThe Netherlands may be four-times Eurovision winners, having last won in 1975, but any hopes of adding to that tally were also dashed on Tuesday night when they fell at the first hurdle.\nFour other contenders will also be going home disappointed - Moldova, FYR Macedonia, Belarus and Denmark.\nBut it's not all bad news - Moldova's early exit means Eduard Romanyuta can go back to his PhD thesis on Ukranian tax policy. I kid you not.\nHere are the 10 countries that did make the grade:\nSee you in Vienna!\nAnd we're off\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 16 countries will go head-to-head at the first Eurovision semi-final tonight live from Vienna, with 10 lucky acts going through to Saturday's grand final.\nAmong those could be Finland's punk rock outfit PKN, Russia's Polina Gagarina - with a song about unity, fairness and equality - and Estonia's ones to watch, duo Elina and Stig.\nThis year's competition has a lot to live up to after Conchita Wurst stormed to glory in 2014 in Copenhagen.

Mr Hadi and his government returned from exile at the same time and established a temporary home in Aden.\nBut in the past year, despite the air campaign and naval blockade continuing unabated, pro-government forces have been unable to dislodge the rebels from their northern strongholds, including Sanaa and its surrounding province.\nThe Houthis have also been able to maintain a siege of the southern city of Taiz and to continue firing missiles and mortars across the border with Saudi Arabia almost daily.\nJihadist militants from al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and rival affiliates of so-called Islamic State (IS) have meanwhile taken advantage of the chaos by seizing territory in the south and stepping up their attacks, notably in government-controlled Aden.\nA war that has set Yemen back decades\nInside Yemen's forgotten war\nA young girl and a city struggling for life\nWhat does Islamic State want with Yemen?\nCivilians have borne the brunt of the fighting and repeatedly been the victims of what activists have described as serious violations of international law by all parties.\nBy early October, at least 4,125 civilians had been killed and 7,207 others injured, according to the United Nations.

It also worries the West because of the threat of attacks emanating from the country as it becomes more unstable.\nWestern intelligence agencies consider AQAP the most dangerous branch of al-Qaeda because of its technical expertise and global reach, and the emergence of IS affiliates in Yemen is a serious concern.\nThe conflict between the Houthis and the elected government is also seen as part of a regional power struggle between Shia-ruled Iran and Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia.\nGulf Arab states have accused Iran of backing the Houthis financially and militarily, though Iran has denied this, and they are themselves backers of President Hadi.\nYemen is strategically important because it sits on the Bab al-Mandab strait, a narrow waterway linking the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden, through which much of the world's oil shipments pass.\nThe UK's delicate balancing act in Yemen", "output": "Yemen, one of the Arab world's poorest countries, has been devastated by a war between forces loyal to the internationally-recognised government of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi and those allied to the Houthi rebel movement.", "category": "Summarization 416.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an article.

Just two - Kenyan runners Joyce Zakary and Koki Manunga - failed them, although the IAAF said samples would be frozen and stored for future reanalysis as science and technology progressed.\nThese are not included in the Wada figures, which relate to 2014.\nAs well as the reduction in samples containing banned substances - or 'adverse analytical findings' - in 2014, the number of tests requiring further investigation also fell. In contrast, the number of adverse findings had increased by more than 10% between 2012 and 2013.\nWada says the fall in these 'atypical findings' is partly due to the introduction of the athlete biological passport.\nWada's results report the number of tests carried out by sport governing bodies and national anti-doping organisations submitted to its 32 accredited laboratories worldwide.\nA blood or urine sample showing a banned substance does not automatically mean the athlete in question has been doping. Some prohibited substances can be produced naturally by the body, for example.\nWada's 2014 report reveals which national anti-doping authorities test their athletes most frequently - though it does not include figures on the number of active competitors by country.\nThe Chinese Anti-Doping Agency, perhaps unsurprisingly given the country's population, took the most samples of any, with 0.4% of the 13,180 samples taken detecting banned substances, while Russia's also took more than 10,000 samples last year.\nUK Anti-Doping, the body responsible for testing British sportsmen and sportswomen, analysed 5,160 samples with 0.7% recording adverse findings.\nIn contrast, the Jamaican Anti-Doping Commission, which was rebuked by Wada for its approach in 2013, conducted 347 tests - all coming back clean - while the National Anti\u2010Doping Centre of Ukraine collected just two samples, one of which showed a banned substance.\nFootball was responsible for 31,242 tests, more than any other sport. Of those, 144 (0.5%) produced adverse findings.\nAthletics provided more than 25,000 samples analysed in 2014 - 1% of those tests resulted in adverse findings.\nBoxing recorded 1.3% adverse results from just over 4,000 tests.\nThere were also adverse findings in sports less commonly associated with banned substances.\nPara-sailing had one of the highest rates of adverse results, with 13%, although that figure is skewed by the relatively small number of participants in the sport with just 24 samples taken and three adverse findings.\nOf the non-Olympic or non-Paralympic sports, 13.7% of samples collected in body building contained banned substances.\nNicole Sapstead, chief executive officer for UK Anti-Doping, said: \"Our analytical findings show an increase in steroid use, which to me indicates there may an increase of prevalence in a more general public, societal way. It is something we are very keen to engage with in our education programme and help because it is not purely about a doping issue or a sport issue.\"\nRecent allegations have claimed doping to be much more prevalent than Wada's failed test statistics imply - especially in athletics.

Sensitive across 13 spectral bands (colours) and able to see details as small as 10m across - the spacecraft's camera \"carpet maps\" the land surface beneath it. Every strip is 290km wide.\nAnd if you think about how fast the satellite is moving in orbit - that is a large swathe of real estate to scoop up at once.\nIt means, for example, that for an elongated country like Norway, it is possible to capture almost its entire territory in just one pass. Some 290,000km2 in just four minutes. Half of Spain can be done in two minutes.\nThe Sentinel's free and open data is being used for all manner of applications - from urban planning and crop monitoring to climate studies and biodiversity assessments.\nCloud is the enemy, though. Although the Sentinel's colour camera can remove light clouds like cirrus, a thick deck is impenetrable. And for tropical regions, this is a significant issue.\n\"We have many orbit segments going from Norway down to the Sahara with only marginal clouds. But when it comes to the tropics, such acquisitions get rare,\" explained Dr Bianca Hoersch, the European Space Agency's (Esa) mission manager on Sentinel-2a.\n\"For this Africa composite, the Climate Change Initiative team took for the tropical part any useful orbit segment, going down to single cloud-free pixel selection, from any data acquired between August 2015 and April 2016.\"\nThe full image contains 32 terabytes of data.\nOnly the African Great Lakes, including Victoria and Tanganyika, have been left in a cloudy state. That said, there are Sentinel-2 scientists who are just as keen to get clear views of inland and coastal water bodies, to track sediment flows, algal blooms, pollution incidents, and the like.\nThe interest in the data was evident at last week's Esa Living Planet Symposium. Many of the sessions dedicated to the satellite's work were standing room only.\nThe spacecraft is not quite working to full capacity. It is still in the ramp-up phase following its launch last June.\nIt has just gone to mapping every part of the Earth's land surface (cloud or no cloud) at least once every 20 days, and hopes to get that down to every 10 days by the end of the year (Europe and Africa are already mapped at this rate). A new X-band radio ground station is being made available to downlink the additional data volume.  Some of it will also be sped to Earth via a laser link.\nIn a year's time, Sentinel-2a will be joined in orbit by a sister platform, Sentinel-2b. This second platform will permit a re-visit time of just five days - making it much easier to achieve those cloud-free segments.\nLooking even further to the future, the EU is determined the imaging capability should be available deep into this century and has asked Esa already to procure an additional pair of satellites, Sentinels 2c and 2d.\n\"Those two spacecraft will potentially be available to launch in 2020 and 2021,\" said Sentinel-2 project manager Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Spoto.\n\"The concept is not to have four spacecraft in orbit, but it will create enough spacecraft assets to replenish the constellation if and when required.\"\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos", "output": "Africa undressed: the continent pictured with no clouds in the sky.", "category": "Summarization 416.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an article.

And these tales are about contemporary obsessions: The desire for youth and beauty ends up with a horrific version of cosmetic surgery, centuries ahead of it becoming available.\"\nMexican actress Hayek, who plays a queen who will do anything in order to have a child, agrees: \"All the conflict they go through is still relevant today, even if we are dressed in Baroque costume.\n\"In my case it's the desperation of a woman to experience motherhood, and the film takes that desperation and makes it grotesque. So a very recognisable human desire becomes something of horror, not only psychologically but visually.\"\nFor example, the film shows Oscar-nominated Hayek, solemnly eating what appears to be the beating heart of a sea monster - after a sorcerer tells her character it will make her pregnant.\nIt is, the actress agrees, a horrible sight; but as a mother and stepmother herself, she says she understands the desire for children.\n\"The real conflict of this woman, and the cleverness of the film, lies in the fact that she puts all her desire for happiness into one thing that lies outside herself. She is impossible to satisfy and that's why she suffers such tragic consequences,\" she says.\n\"Everyone in here suffers very harsh penalties for their obsessions,\" explains Toby Jones, who plays a king fixated by his new pet - a giant flea - and has to give his daughter's hand in marriage to a giant after losing a bet.\n\"Folk tales tend to be very dark and all fairy tales have darkness at their root, but these are particularly strange.

If the BBC can, as they do, provide all the locally significant news, what is left to motivate the local reader to buy a paper?\"\nShe added that the corporation was \"destroying local newspapers and it could eventually happen to national newspapers as well\".\nMr Harding, who previously edited The Times, said the BBC's regional bulletins attracted some of its largest audiences for news.\n\"We have a direct interest in the health of local newspapers and regional newsrooms,\" he said. \"We thrive thanks to vibrant public debate and courtesy of the stories and ideas unearthed by our colleagues in rival news organisations.\"\nBut he added that the BBC's primary responsibility must be to \"serve licence fee payers\".\n\"They want and are entitled to the best possible local news services we can deliver,\" he said.\nFollowing the recent scandal of executive payoffs and fallout from the dropped Newsnight investigation into Jimmy Savile, Mr Harding also spoke about the need to retain the trust placed in the BBC by the public.\n\"Trust is our most prized asset - and the key to our future,\" he said. \"It depends upon us striving, ceaselessly, to be fair, reliable and open to ideas.\"\nHe stressed the BBC's \"uncompromising commitment to accuracy, impartiality, diversity of opinion and the decent treatment of people in the news\".\nCommenting on the issue of press regulation, Mr Harding highlighted the need for a free and independent press.\n\"I worry when politicians and judges weigh in, \" he said, \"either frequently or eagerly, on the behaviour of journalists and news organisations.\"\n\"At a time when our society needs curious, inquisitive journalism more than ever, I think we need to be extremely vigilant against encroachment on press freedom and freedom of expression,\" he added.", "output": "News director James Harding has spoken out against the \"mistaken view\" the BBC should \"rein in\" local news coverage for fear of damaging local newspapers.", "category": "Summarization 416.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an article.

From there he will cross into India to reach Srinagar.\nMilitant circles say there are about 3,000 to 4,000 former Kashmiri fighters stranded in and around Muzaffarabad.\nFighters without a cause\nAnti-militant rallies in Pakistan\nMany want to return home, but some do not have the means to pay for the journey.\nIndia and Pakistan both claim Kashmir - they have fought two wars over the territory.\nA Line of Control (LoC) divides a narrow strip of Pakistan-administered Kashmir from the bulk of the region, which is held by India.\nBeginning in 1988, thousands of Kashmiri youths from the Indian side crossed over the LoC into Pakistan to train in guerrilla warfare, arm themselves and then go back to fight Indian forces in their homeland.\nThey kept Kashmir on the boil for a decade during the 1990s, but were increasingly frustrated when Pakistani groups, such as Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad, Al-Badr and Harkatul Mujahideen started to gain ascendancy in the \"Kashmir jihad\".\nThese groups brought with them greater resources to eclipse local groups, and professed foreign religious ideologies that were less tolerant of local sensibilities.\nBy the mid-2000s, after tens of thousands of Kashmiris had been killed in the uprising without shaking Indian rule, the futility of the militant-driven movement was becoming obvious and there was increased international pressure on Pakistan to withdraw support to these groups.\nThe gradual winding down of the movement has left the bulk of the native Kashmiri fighters in a state of suspended animation.\nThose who could raise funds for a journey back home decided to test an earlier offer of amnesty by the Indian government.\nOthers have simply been sulking as return routes across the LoC - which would be a much cheaper option - are still closed to them.\nDuring 2011, roughly 100 former militants left Pakistan along with their families and returned to their native villages on the Indian side.\nTheir fate was closely watched by fighters still stranded in Pakistan.\n\"Nothing bad happened to them,\" says Rafiq Ahmed, another former fighter in Muzaffarabad who has been in touch with some of the returnees.\n\"They were held by the Indian police for debriefing for a few days, and were then released. They are now living normal lives.\"\nThus emboldened, more than 500 fighters have returned to their native homes on the Indian side during the first five months of 2012, says Ghulam Mohammad, a former insurgent who is close to the people involved with the repatriation issues of Kashmiri militants.\n\"Most of them were married and they have also taken along their families - some 1,000 to 1,500 people in all,\" he says.\nMr Mohammad says that between 10 and 15 former fighters are leaving Pakistan every week, along with their families.\nThey fly to Kathmandu on a Pakistani passport. From there they cross into India and reach Kashmir, where the returning men report to the local police to confirm their arrival.\n\"The Kathmandu route has two advantages; it is familiar to former militants and their 'handlers' who used it in the past to smuggle militants into India, and it is away from the public glare and therefore suitable to keep this exodus under wraps,\" he says.\nThe insurgents' departure comes amid reports of drastic cuts in the money which militant circles say the Pakistani security establishment used to pay them for their activities.\nAccording to these circles, the practice of disbursing funds to various groups for operations inside Indian-administered Kashmir was stopped by the military government of former president Pervez Musharraf in 2006.\nIn recent months, they say, Pakistan has halved the funds which it still pays to these groups to meet their establishment expenses - such as office rent, stationery, transport, fuel or food.\nMilitant sources say that these funds can barely support small groups of core activists within each of roughly a dozen Kashmiri militant organisations that still run offices in Pakistani-administered Kashmir.\nPakistan denies giving the insurgents any support other than moral and diplomatic backing for their movement.\nAlthough many former militants say those who have gone back in recent months have benefited from the Indian amnesty, some who have already returned to the Indian side told the BBC they have been disappointed by the lack of opportunities in their native land and are finding it difficult to rebuild their lives.", "output": "Twenty years after they took up arms to fight Indian rule in the Kashmir valley, hundreds of local insurgents are now returning to their homes after renouncing militancy.", "category": "Summarization 416.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an article.

A new order, as vague as the earlier one was precise, now asks the service providers to block access only to those sites which have child pornographic content. It's led to more confusion, criticism and yes, more ridicule.\nSo why exactly did the government go ahead with the move?\nThe ban had its genesis in a petition filed in India's Supreme Court by a lawyer seeking a complete ban on porn sites because, he argued, it was socially destructive and promoted violence against women.\nWatching porn, he said in his petition, puts the country's security in danger. It also propels men to commit sex crimes. The court's reaction was to criticise the government's inability to act against internet sites that promoted child pornography.\nThe government's reaction was to ban porn sites.\nAcross India, people fumed, raged and ranted. Radio and television talk shows filled up with irate callers speaking both for and against the ban. One radio station was inundated with calls for its debate, To porn or not to porn.\nSocial media was abuzz as many described it as an invasion of privacy and an attempt at moral policing. A bestselling author, Chetan Bhagat, pleaded with the government to not ban porn in a tweet.\nThe hashtag #NextBanIdea began trending on Twitter as many decided to take to humour and come out with a list of things the government could consider banning - from the Facebook game Candy Crush, to people who take selfies and relatives who badger young Indians to get married.\nThe governing BJP, which runs the federal government, was also left red-faced after some pointed out that a few years ago some of its politicians were caught on camera watching pornographic clips on their mobile phones inside a state legislative assembly.\nFor many the ban is futile. Indians are believed to be among the largest consumers of internet pornography - number four in a list of countries published by Pornhub, the world's largest pornographic video-sharing website, after the United States, Britain and Canada.\nIn fact, there are suggestions the move may have had the opposite effect. One Indian website, Quint, notes that Google Trends recorded a sharp increase in keyword searches for pornographic content and porn stars over the past week.\nAnd then there is India's rich history of celebrating sexuality. Some pointed out the irony of the ban in a country that gave the world the Kama Sutra, the ancient text on sexual etiquette and practice.\nOthers wanted to know if the government planned to cover or block access to the country's centuries-old temples and cave art with sexually explicit sculptures and paintings.\nSource: Pornhub/Quartz India\nThe debate has also sparked concern over what some see as a growing culture of intolerance promoted by a series of actions by the right-wing BJP government, many of whose members are self-professed Hindu nationalists.\nSome Indian states, governed by the BJP, have banned the production and consumption of beef - because the cow is considered sacred for India's Hindu majority.

Under India's previous Congress-led government, a controversial book on Hinduism by American academic Wendy Doniger was banned.\nFor many, these moves threaten India's democracy and tradition of cultural pluralism. There's a fear that the space for criticism and outspoken views is slowly being constricted.\nFor now at least, the move to ban porn has backfired - the government has been forced to come out and say that it supports freedom of communication.

For now, most third-party apps will depend on a wirelessly-linked iPhone for processing power because Apple hasn't yet allowed them to run natively.\nEven so, early indications suggest the US firm has another hit on its hands.\n\"We are raising our Apple Watch shipment estimates for 2015 from 17 million units to 20 million units, as we estimate sales of over two million units during the pre-sales phase alone, and believe watch revenues could contribute as much as 8% of [Apple's] total revenue in 2017,\" wrote Daniel Ives from FBR Capital Markets in a note to investors earlier this week.\nEarly reviews have also praised Apple for creating the best smartwatch yet.\nA subsequent update to Google's rival Android Wear software will have eroded some of that lead.\nBut the Watch retains unique features.\nThey include the taptic engine, which uses a vibration motor to create different strengths and patterns of taps on a user's wrist.\nAnd the digital crown, which can be twisted to control the machine as an alternative to swiping across its small screen.\nTo mark the launch, the BBC asked four experts to provide different takes on its potential impact.\nChief of research, Kantar Worldpanel ComTech\nKantar Insights\nSince the launch of Apple Watch, everyone looking at the industry wants an answer to the question: How many will Apple be able to sell?\nOf course, sales are a quick and easy measure of success but, as with the iPhone, looking for market share alone may not present a full picture of what Apple could achieve with this device.\nWe have already seen how the go-to-market strategy for the Watch is different to anything Apple has done so far. In my opinion, this strategy is not an effort to maintain the luxury status of the device.\nRather, it aims to learn about consumer preferences so that production of the different models can be tweaked to better meet demand.\nThe role that online plays in the go-to-market strategy also shows Apple's desire - and need - to grow its online strength.\nThis will help offload some in-store traffic, which should lead to better customer service.\nIt also enables Apple to gather information on a larger number of customers, since many do not have access to a physical Apple Store and would have otherwise gone through a traditional retailer.\nIn addition, the Watch will help Apple strengthen its installed base by locking in customers, since it requires them to own, or at least use, an iPhone as well.\nConsidering that, according to our surveys, 20% of UK Android users and 67% of French Android users would consider changing from Google's operating system to Apple's to buy the smartwatch of choice, Apple Watch represents a hook into its ecosystem as well.\nSenior editor, Cnet\nCnet\nThe world of wearables is a market full of middling products.\nThe Apple Watch debuts as the most polished, high-design smartwatch yet, with an extremely ambitious feature set. But what it does, in many ways, isn't far off from what other smartwatch platforms like Google's one-year-old Android Wear or Samsung's Gear watches have aimed to do.\nHowever, an already vast army of app developers ready to create for it could end up being the difference-maker.\nI've been wearing one for several weeks.\nRight now, the Apple Watch is complicated: its interface takes getting used to, it has new ways to interact, and not all of them are intuitive.\nYou need an iPhone to use it: this isn't truly a standalone product. Third-party apps, which are already here in droves, feel like very early drafts.\nBattery life is only a little more than a day. And its price is higher, even at its lowest end, than most of the competition.\nIt's a first-generation product in a new product line, and it's not a must-buy yet.\nBattery life will be hard to fix, but some people may be fine with charging their watch every day.\nSoftware performance, on the other hand, could improve throughout the year. The software from third-party developers feels slow, and sluggish to load data.\nImproved app updates, and the launch of more fully connected apps that natively live on the watch, could fix this problem.\nThe Apple Watch could eventually be a standalone device that works without a phone, someday, but it isn't now and probably won't be for the foreseeable future.\nExplaining why people need one, and what they can get out of it, isn't as easy as it was with the iPhone and iPad.\nOr maybe, the use cases will emerge over time.\nI've found myself frustrated by aspects of Apple Watch as I've worn it. On the other hand, even with its issues, it already has more polished software than any other piece of wearable tech I've seen.\nThe Apple Watch may sell more and be better recognised than any other piece of wearable tech in history, but it'll take a few years before it really finds its purpose in a transforming world of connected things.\nApp developer and consultant\nMalcolm Barclay\nThe Apple Watch is arguably an impressive entry into the burgeoning wearable digital devices market.\nAlong with all the usual players that must have a presence - Facebook, Twitter et al - we are sure to see some ingenious, useful, entertaining and fun watch apps.\nHowever, when contrasted with the early days of the app market, the financial rewards for developers seeking fortunes selling Apple Watch applications alone will be minuscule.\nWhy? You need an existing iPhone to pair with the Apple Watch in order to run apps; the processing power of the iPhone is leveraged and the output (a view) is displayed on the watch.\nDevelopers are essentially shipping an iPhone application that \"extends\" itself to the Watch as opposed to installing on it.\nAn extension alone would have to be something quite special in order to convince users to part with money for it.\nAlthough Apple has announced that developers will be able to create native apps later this year, iPhone pairing will remain necessary.\nAnd native watch apps may be a niche category.\nWill they have enough power? What will Apple allow?\nAnswers to these questions will dictate the market available to developers.\nUsers' expectations of applications have immeasurably changed since the initial launch days of the App Store.\nI once met the developers of a social application that sold virtual ice cubes to their users on a hot day; in turn they would gift them to each other.\nGiven the plethora of emojis that now ship by default in iOS and Android, this seems laughable today.\nApps now need to be more sophisticated - and costly to produce - to succeed.\nEditor-in-chief, Ablogtowatch.com\nAblogtowatch.com\nPerhaps the most amusing response by the traditional timepiece industry to the Apple Watch is an actual debate as to whether or not this connected \"smart\" electronic device worn on the wrist can be properly defined as a watch.\nIn my opinion, such conversations are not only irrelevant but typify the type of legendary conservatism that has helped the traditional watch industry to both thrive and suffer in recent history.\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, the mechanical watch industry was almost decimated thanks to the arrival of cheap, highly accurate electronic quartz watches.\nIt adapted by focusing on creating mechanical objects of beauty, which are, by many accounts, lovely examples of obsolete technology.\nNow that smartwatches are making a play for wrist space, even passionate collectors could stop wearing their traditional counterparts.\nIn my experience, the traditional watch industry splits its time between ignoring/criticising items like the Apple Watch, debuting less-than-stellar competitive products, and simply acknowledging that while it recognise the potential threat, it lacks the tools and flexibility to properly adapt.\nMost troubling for me is that too many people in the traditional watch industry simply don't understand smartwatches - what they do, and what appeal they may have for consumers.\nThe smartwatch industry struggles to clearly explain why consumers need one.\nBut at the same time, in my opinion, the traditional watch industry will also struggle because it hasn't taken the time to truly understand what items like the Apple Watch represent for their business.", "output": "The Watch's release represents a chance for Apple to change the world again with an industry-defining product.", "category": "Summarization 416.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an article.

I enjoy a great deal of privilege. And I certainly have the black crime implicit bias: I am more likely to see threat in African Americans than I would Caucasians.\n\"Racial profiling was the number one issue facing police [in the 1990s], and I came to understand two things. Bias in policing was not just a few officers in a few departments; and, overwhelmingly, the police in this country are well-intentioned. I couldn't put those two thoughts together in my head until I was introduced to the science of implicit bias.\n\"We all have implicit biases whereby we link groups to stereotypes, possibly producing discriminatory behaviour - even in individuals who are totally against prejudice.\n\"The original 'Shoot, Don't Shoot' studies have a subject sitting in front a computer monitor and photos pop up very quickly, showing either a white or black man. That man either has a gun in his hand or a neutral object like a cell phone. The subject is told 'if you see a threat, hit the 'shoot' key and if you don't see a threat, hit the 'don't shoot' key'. \"\nThe Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays from 12:05 GMT/13:05 BST\nListen to the programme\nDownload the podcast\nThe studies suggest that implicit biases affect these actions - for example in some studies people are quicker to 'shoot' an unarmed black man than an unarmed white man. A Department of Justice report released in March looking at the use of deadly force by Philadelphia police, supports the idea that police are susceptible to implicit bias:\n\"One of the things they looked at is what they called threat perception failure. The officer believed that the person was armed and it turned out not to be the case. And these failures were more likely to occur when the subject was black [even if the officers were themselves black or Latino].\n\"Officers, like the rest of us, have an implicit bias linking blacks to crime. So the black crime implicit bias might be implicated in some of the use of deadly force against African-Americans in our country.\n\"An important message in our training is that stereotypes are based in part on fact, and we have to recognise this because in our country, people of colour are disproportionately represented amongst the people who commit street crime.\n\"That does not give you licence to treat every individual in a group as if they fit the stereotype, that's where we go wrong.\"\nFormer policeman Seth Stoughton is now a law professor at the University of South Carolina.\n\"The first rule of law enforcement is to go home at the end of your shift. The key principle is officer survival. That's what all training is designed to promote. But it ends up endangering civilians rather than preserving their safety.\n\"The warrior culture - the belief that police officers are soldiers engaged in battle with the criminal element - that has contributed to some shootings that were most likely avoidable.\n\"It starts in police recruitment videos that show officers shooting rifles, strapping on hard body armour, using force. That attracts a particular type of candidate, and the Police Academy further entrenches this.\n\"It teaches officers to be afraid by telling them that policing is an incredibly dangerous profession.\n\"Officers are trained to view every encounter as a potential deadly force incident: you walk up to a person who is loitering outside of a convenience store, their hands are in their pockets. You as the officer begin talking to them, and without saying a word they pull a gun out of their pocket and begin shooting you.\n\"Training involves an average of about 60 hours on deadly force - the use of firearms - and just over 60 hours on self-defence. Compare that to de-escalation conflict resolution training: the average there is only eight hours of training, and most of that is classroom-based.\n\"When the military is designing a mission, they have in mind the fact that they're going to lose soldiers. The police profession has strongly repudiated that notion. No officer fatalities are acceptable.\n\"If all of the states had the same approach and the same numbers of officer-involved homicides as the best states, the states that had the fewest, we could expect about 300 to 600 lives to be saved every year.\"\nCharles Ramsey is the Commissioner of the Philadelphia Police Department, and was asked by President Obama to run the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing.\n\"We live in a society where everybody wants to point fingers, but we have a lot of deeply-rooted societal problems: poverty, education, poor housing stock.\n\"We've got to deal with the issue of extreme poverty. Philadelphia has the highest rate of poverty among US cities. You have an underground economy that supports many of these neighbourhoods - drugs, prostitution, illegal cigarette sales.\n\"Why are police in large numbers in some of these neighbourhoods? We have to deal with the reality that there's a disproportionate amount of crime occurring in many of these neighbourhoods.\n\"We've had several police officers shot and killed during the past seven years.  I've had eight officers killed in the line of duty - five shot dead. So there is violence that takes place against police as well, and that needs to be taken into consideration.\"\nTo tackle the problem, he has divided Philadelphia into separate areas with their own teams:\n\"They have monthly community meetings to talk about crime and disorder. Cadets that come out of the academy are assigned to foot patrol right away, they don't automatically go into cars. So that they actually get to know people in these challenged communities, good folks that are there entrapped in certain conditions.\"\nIn response to the Department of Justice report criticising Philadelphia police's use of force, Commissioner Ramsey introduced new training that focuses on de-escalation, as well as armed response:\n\"Putting them in scenarios where they have to exercise good judgement and being able to critique that so that when they are in these real live situations, their reaction, their response, is really more consistent with what the actual threat is.\"\nThe Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays from 1205 GMT/1305 BST.

The video below explains what they are:\nBut Syeedy didn't agree that this was spiritual - he thought it was akin to black magic.\nHe adhered to a violent with-us-or-against-us ideology known as \"takfirism\" - it's basically the belief that one has the right to declare another Muslim not to be a Muslim.\nIts followers, be they supporters of the self-styled Islamic State group, al-Qaeda or another AK-47-toting outfit, believe they have the right to be the judge, jury and executioner of others, according to their interpretation of Islamic Sharia law.\nSo if you don't agree with their way of being a Muslim, you've abandoned the faith. And if you've abandoned the faith, the penalty is death.\nThis horrible crime may read like an isolated bizarre incident, but it's not.\nIt's the second murder in a year in the UK of someone who identifies themselves as a Muslim, by another Muslim, for purely sectarian reasons.\nShopkeeper Asad Shah was the first. He was killed in different circumstances - he belonged to a particular sect that other Muslims don't regard as being actually Islamic.\nHis killer was so incensed by what the shopkeeper had put online that he got in his car in Bradford, drove 200 miles to Glasgow, and stabbed him to death.\n\"The murder in Rochdale is a reflection of what I believe has been happening in the UK and around the world - there is a civil war within Islam right now,\" says Haras Rafiq of the Quilliam Foundation counter-extremism think tank.\n\"There are people who have been carrying out the blasphemy law and killing people who they deem not to be Muslim enough. This is something that I think we are going to see more of.\"", "output": "On Friday a jury at Manchester Crown Court found Mohammed Syeedy guilty of murdering a 71-year-old imam - because he wasn't Muslim enough.", "category": "Summarization 416.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an article.

That, in turn, sells more comics.\n\"I think the differences in attracting a male/female readership is subtlety small. Because I go to conventions and sell my material to people I get feedback and notice who is buying my artwork.\n\"Females seem to appreciate character relationships and that emotional connection between them a bit more. I know I do, as a female reader, get inspired when there's great characters in the story with interesting relationships to others.\"\nRoberts believes there to be a healthy female audience for comics.\nShe says: \"Girls don't only seem to cosplay as their favourite characters they also buy comics too.\n\"I always get excited talking to people who are inspired by comics and even more so to learn that they have taken their passion even further, that it in turn has inspired them to create something, like fan art, fiction or even their own original stuff.\n\"To which I say to them: see you next year at the stall next to mine selling your own comic.\"\nLouise Quirion: Comic book exhibition curator\nFrench-born Louise Quirion is a graduate of University of Dundee's MLitt course in Comics and Graphic Novels.\nShe is also the curator of Girls in Print, an exhibition running until 21 October in the university's Tower Building Foyer.\nThe exhibition includes more than 30 original artworks from a number of Dundee publisher DC Thomson's titles such as The Topper, Bunty and Twinkle.\n\"When I began looking into this area, I was amazed at the range of stories covered by girls' comics,\" says Quirion.\n\"As well as school and ballet stories, there are also sports stories, historical dramas, science-fiction and tales of the supernatural.\n\"This exhibition is a great opportunity to discover or re-discover the high school stories of the Four Marys or the space adventures of the Supercats, while appreciating rarely seen original art.\"\nTo show how comics have evolved today, the exhibition also features work by current female comics artists such as Kate Charlesworth, Tanya Roberts and Gillian Hatcher.\nDuring her research for the display, Quirion became interested by how publishers in the UK target readers with gender-specific titles, which is a different approach to other parts of Europe.\nShe says: \"I find it fascinating because France and UK are geographically very close, and yet their comic cultures are based on very different ideas.\n\"I feel like this separation girls/boys is mostly a marketing strategy. They are still using it in Japan and it works great there.\"\nBut she adds: \"Everyone reads comics in France, whatever their gender or age is, so the best strategy is more to appeal to everyone.\n\"I know American comics are pretty popular right now, but I encourage anyone that likes comics to also read other things.\"\nTeam Girl Comic: Scottish-based collective of comic book creators\nTGC was set up to as a support network for women cartoonists across Scotland, and features in Louise Quirion's Girls in Print exhibition in Dundee.\nGill Hatcher, editor and founder of the group, says: \"The number of women and girls in Scotland both attending comic events and making comics has exploded in recent years.\n\"When TGC began in 2009 we were a very small tight-knit group, but the number of people getting in touch and asking to join keeps on growing.\n\"There are a lot more opportunities for young people to learn the craft of writing and drawing comics, and lots more channels for them to get their work out to a wider audience.\n\"And gradually, as more women have got involved in the Scottish comics scene, the more it has opened up to new creators who might have previously felt intimidated or unwelcome.\"\nHatcher says the subjects women want to tackle through comic stories and art are wide-ranging.\nShe says: \"Our contributors write about all sorts of subject matters, often highly personal and touching on politics, identity and feminism.\n\"There's often a lot of humour in the stories we tell too.\"\nHatcher adds: \"Our latest anthology, That Girl Comic, featured our artists' different takes on the theme 'growing up' and we ended up with a great mixture of childhood memories, teenage angst and present-day reflections, as well as some more surreal and whimsical interpretations.\"\nVicky Stonebridge: Artist and comic book fan\nStonebridge, a painter, craftworker and co-organiser of the Highlands' popular but now defunct HiEx comic convention, is based in Lochcarron in Wester Ross.\nGrowing up in the Highlands, she recalls pouring over a comic her dad bought her when she was three or four.\n\"It wasn't the Dandy and Beano I later came to love, but a 'boys' comic with sci-fi, action and crazy perilous monster stories in it. I loved it,\" she says.\n\"I was an early reader, but didn't really get what was going on, there was a giant rat man who was mugging people and being generally menacing.\"\nStonebridge's interest in comics was reignited later at art college when a friend showed her a copy of the British sci-fi and fantasy adventure comic, 2000AD.\nShe says: \"It blew me away. I was the only other person I knew who read it, it was for a long time the only comic I knew.\n\"I even wrote part of my dissertation about it. I loved the escapism, the action, satire, punk attitude, fantasy and adventure. I was never a girly girl so stories of ballerinas and public school girls were never going to cut it with me.\"\nShe adds: \"My love of sci-fi went along similar lines, with a teacher taking a book off me when I was seven as it was 'too old for me'.\n\"I still remember vividly the aliens, mutants and space paradoxes that excited me, and the feeling of resentment at being told it wasn't for me.\n\"This is why I enjoy working with young people and encouraging their interests in comics, geek culture , genre fiction and art, because I think it is important to support them in their journey of discovery in order to foster creativity and imagination instead of closing doors.\"\nStonebridge says a big challenge with comics is challenging the way female characters can be portrayed in the illustrations.\n\"There are lots more examples of strong female characters in comic books and film adaptations coming to the fore,\" she says.\n\"2000AD always had some strong women, but often these were sidekicks to the main male character.\n\"The character Psi Judge Anderson is an interesting character, some writers and artists have given her real depth, and yet there still persists other artists who still portray her as a pouting doll with ridiculous breasts.\n\"A more consistent 2000AD female character was Aimee Nixon. She switched sides and her allegiances were muddy, but she was always fierce and kick-ass.\"\nStonebridge adds: \"As I've become middle aged myself I crave to see older women characters, as all these idealised slim attractive comic women just don't resonate.\n\"I love to see diversity in comics, characters who reflect the real world. There are always gnarly old men characters, but where are the women - apart from being super villains of course, because everyone knows that older women are always evil.\"", "output": "All images are copyrighted.", "category": "Summarization 416.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an article.

There was a 0.01% chance of paralysis, she was told. But she woke up paralysed from the waist down. Since then, the \"small things\" in life have taken her a lot longer.\n\"Sometimes I feel like I've had a training session before I've got dressed,\" she says. \"It takes me around three hours to go to the toilet, and get washed and dressed.\" Every other morning she wakes up thinking: \"Can I not have a day off, or even an hour?\"\nRoutine is important. Everything takes a lot of planning and at home, in Glasgow, everything needs to be in the right place to allow Jo to reach what she needs and move around in her wheelchair easily.\nBut being displaced at international competitions means that organisation is taken out of her control, and there is only so much preparation that can be done. \"The first few days at a camp or holding camp are just getting my bearings,\" she says, \"working out where I'm going to put my case so I can reach it, have I got a seat in the toilet so I can get on, can I sit in the shower?\"\nAt Doha for the World Championships last year, she arrived to discover there was no shower in the room, so she found one at the swimming pool she could use. And at Doha she could not reach the correct button in the lift for her floor so she resorted to carrying a shoe around with her to reach it.\nFor most of us this would be an annoyance, but Jo takes it as just another challenge to be met. \"I'm very good at thinking outside the box,\" she says.\nWhen she first became disabled, people assumed she would move back in with her parents in Yorkshire. But her reaction was: \"No, my home and life are in Glasgow.\" She was determined to make this happen and says that even when she was in hospital, her chief goal was to remain independent.\n\"I know everybody can't, but for me it was really important not to have a personal assistant,\" she says. \"So I spent a lot of time and repetition. Practice, practice, practice.\"\nMost of this was learning how to cook, clean, and transfer in and out of the car - everything that meant she could look after her personal care and be in control of her day and routine without having to rely on other people.\nShe does get tired though, and admits she needs to make sure she rests. On a Wednesday, she has a light afternoon built into her training schedule, but she ends up doing housework, which can take her a few hours and is still difficult for her. So proper rest is important.\nIt has been just over five years since Jo became paralysed and she says she feels like the same person. Actually, she says she was OK with it straight away. \"I was determined it wasn't going to change who I am, and certainly not make me any worse of a person.\"\nThere is one thing she says she desperately misses, though - just \"popping out\" without having to plan with precision.\nBBC Ouch are in Rio covering the Paralympics, follow all our coverage on Facebook and Twitter as well as on Snapchat.\nYou can follow all the Paralympics action on Radio 5 Live and the BBC Sport website throughout the Games and you can also sign up for medal alerts via the BBC Sport App.", "output": "Paralympic gold medallist Jo Butterfield explains the challenges of being taken away from a regular routine at international competitions.", "category": "Summarization 416.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an article.

Its wheeling beams of radio waves now pass us by, and the researchers have calculated that this can be explained by \u201cprecession\u201d: the dying star wobbling into the dip in space-time that its own orbit created.\nTheir findings are published in The Astrophysical Journal and were presented at the 225th meeting of the American Astronomical Society.\nA pulsar is a small but improbably dense neutron star - the collapsed remnant of a supernova.\n\u201cThey pack more mass than our Sun has in a sphere that\u2019s only 10 miles across,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author Joeri van Leeuwen, from the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy (Astron).\nWhen they occur as binaries, neutron stars come hard up against Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity, and should generate space-time ripples called gravitational waves, which astronomers hope one day to detect.\nThis particular specimen, Pulsar J1906, popped up unexpectedly during a survey Dr van Leeuwen and colleagues were conducting at the Arecibo Observatory, Puerto Rico.\n\u201cThat was a real Eureka moment that night,\u201d he told journalists at the conference.\n\u201cIt was strange, because that part of the sky's been surveyed lots of times - and then something really bright and new appears.\u201d\nThey soon discovered the pulsar had a companion star, and that it was pushing the boundaries of what astronomers know of these bizarre systems.\nThe pair circle each other in just four hours - the second fastest such orbit ever seen - and the pulsar spins seven times per second, sweeping its two beams of radio waves across space to Earth.\nDr van Leeuwen\u2019s team set about monitoring those waves, nearly every day for the next five years, using the world\u2019s five biggest radio telescopes.\nAll told, they clocked one billion rotations of the pulsar.\nThe biggest radio telescopes on Earth:\n\u201cBy precisely tracking the motion of the pulsar, we were able to measure the gravitational interaction between the two highly compact stars with extreme accuracy,\u201d said co-author Prof Ingrid Stairs of the University of British Columbia, Canada.\nEach is approximately 1.3 times heavier than our Sun, but they are only separated by about one solar diameter. \u201cThe resulting extreme gravity causes many remarkable effects,\u201d Prof Stairs said.\nChief among those is the time-space warp and the wobble that has now caused J1906 to shine its light elsewhere - for the time being.\nThe pulsar\u2019s axis drifts by two degrees every year, and according to Dr van Leeuwen\u2019s calculations it should swing back around to shine on Earth again by about 2170.\nProf Tim O'Brien is an astrophysicist working at the University of Manchester and the Jodrell Bank Observatory in the UK - one of the facilities that helped track the pulsar.\nHe was not involved in the research, but told BBC News he had watched the project develop with interest.\n\"It's a pretty unusual object,\" he said, adding that tracking it in such detail had been a \"big campaign\".\n\"Using these five telescopes all around the world, they effectively accounted for every single one of the billion rotations over five years.\n\"It's incredible that you can measure all these parameters with such precision.\n\"These systems are amazing natural laboratories for studying gravity.

It did add, though, that most trips there are trouble-free.\nAt the end of last month the Maldives celebrated its birthday, 52 years since independence from Britain.\nBut the festivities were marred when the government ordered troops to storm the country's parliament and prevent opposition MPs from entering.\nIt was the latest dramatic attempt by President Abdulla Yameen to maintain his grip on power, and the latest twist in a tale of tropical intrigue worthy of a thriller.\nThe story is certainly set against a suitably exotic backdrop.\nThe Maldives is justifiably famous for its breathtakingly beautiful beaches and breathtakingly expensive luxury hotels.\nBut while the water of the coral reefs that surround them may be crystal clear, politics in the so-called \"island paradise\" has always been very murky indeed.\nThe political drama is centred, not on the beaches but on Male, the tiny, urbanised island where all of the Maldives' major institutions are based and which is one of the most densely populated cities on Earth.\nFor 30 years the country was a corrupt autocracy, ruled with the proverbial \"iron fist\" by Maumoon Abdul Gayoom.\nPresident Gayoom shrugged off numerous coup attempts during his three decades in power, but the wily tactician could not resist forever the growing demand for democratic reform.\nIn 2008, a charismatic young progressive, Mohamed Nasheed, swept to power in the country's first democratic elections.\nHe rolled back repressive laws, bolstered democratic institutions and captured the world's attention with an underwater cabinet meeting to highlight the risks of rising sea levels.\nBut the Maldives' brief moment as a model Islamic democracy was not to last.\nLess than four years later, Mr Nasheed resigned following a mutiny by the police and weeks of demonstrations after the arrest of the chief justice, something he now calls a coup.\nIn November 2013, Mr Yameen took office, but as he is Mr Gayoom's half-brother, it looked like a return to the old order.\nHowever, over the last year the two strongmen have had a spectacular falling out.\nSo much so that Mr Gayoom, the grizzled old dictator, has thrown in his lot with the dashing young democrat, Mr Nasheed.\nTo give you an idea of just how improbable this union is, you should know that Mr Nasheed was imprisoned and tortured during Mr Gayoom's rule.\nNevertheless these unlikely allies have prospered and - bolstered by defections from the ruling party - the opposition has managed to gain a small majority in the Maldivian parliament.\nThey had a plan - to stage a coup, but a democratic one.\nThey tabled a no-confidence vote against the speaker of the country's parliament.\nThe idea was to replace him and his deputy with opposition figures, who would lead an emergency government until elections early next year.\nIt looked likely to work, until, that is, Mr Yameen literally called in the troops.\nThey barred opposition MPs from entering parliament for the vote, thereby putting paid to the plotters' plans.\nSince then Mr Yameen has been trying to strip the opposition of its majority, arresting MPs and ruling that defectors must resign their seats.\nIt has been enough to allow him to cling on to power, for the moment at least.\nIf you are wondering why on earth you should care about this sun-soaked soap opera, you need to see the wider picture - because the Maldives is at the centre of a much bigger strategic power play.\nThe country's more than 1,000 islands stretch 800km (500 miles) into the Indian Ocean.\nThey straddle crucial sea-lanes, notably the busy but prosaically named bottleneck, the \"One and a Half Degree Channel\".\nIt makes the Maldives a pawn in the great game for regional influence being played out between India and China, the outcome of which may influence the shape of the world economy for years to come.\nBut there are more basic principles at stake here too - human rights and the rule of democracy.\nAnd they matter just as much in small nations with great beaches like the Maldives, as they do anywhere else in the world.", "output": "Are you dreaming of a holiday in the Maldives?", "category": "Summarization 416.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an article.

This is also true of the electoral system in the UK and elsewhere. Such systems are democratic, although some people would like them to be changed to be more directly representative of how votes were cast.\nSince being elected he has repeated this sentiment, saying he would rather see a system in which, \"you get 100 million votes and somebody else gets 90 million votes, and you win\".\nBut the president-elect has benefited from the system he dubbed undemocratic.\nIt is likely that the final tallies from last week's election will confirm that more people voted for Hillary Clinton, but Mr Trump won, under a system known as the electoral college.\nCampaigning organisations such as National Popular Vote agree with Mr Trump, arguing that the candidate most people vote for should get into the White House.\nTwo days after seeming to stand by his words, however, Mr Trump tweeted that the electoral college was \"actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play\".\nInstead of totting up each person's vote, in the US every state gets a certain number of votes depending partly on the size of its population. The way it's worked out means there's a minimum of three votes per state.\nIn most states, the most popular candidate wins all of its votes, even if 49% of people voted a different way. The system is different in Maine and Nebraska, where voting is broken down into Congressional districts, which means not all the state's electoral college votes have to go to the same candidate.\nWinning a state like California, which gets 55 of the total 538 electoral college votes, will put a candidate a long way towards the 270 state votes needed to win the presidency. Even if they win that state by a single vote, they get all 55 votes.\nIt is better to win by a small margin in lots of states than win by a landslide in just a few - the scale of the win (and therefore the number of people who support you) is meaningless - you still only get one state with a fixed number of electoral college votes.\nCandidates identify the states that are safely either Republican or Democrat - the ones they are bound to lose or win - and broadly ignore these in their campaign efforts. Instead, they focus their attentions on the states that tend to swing between the two parties.\nThis means that, arguably, the election is decided not by the nation as whole but by a small number of so-called battleground states.\nIf you live in a state where most people support one party, your vote against that party is wasted, whereas if you live in a more divided state your vote has greater influence.\nElectoral college votes also do not match up exactly to population size meaning some people's votes have more clout than others. Because the minimum number of votes a state can have is three, the smallest states get electoral power disproportionate to their population.\nThe average state gets one electoral vote for every 565,166 people. But Wyoming, which only has a population of 532,668, gets a vote for every 177,556 people, giving those individuals more than three times the electoral influence of the average American.\nFor many, the idea that you can have the most people vote for you but still lose the election seems undemocratic. This has happened five times in US history, most recently in 2000 when Al Gore lost to George W Bush.\nThe fact that Mr Trump won several key swing states very narrowly, while Mrs Clinton won big majorities in some states is part of the reason she was able to get more votes but still lose the election.\nTwo-thirds (273 out of 399) of campaign events in the 2016 election were held in only six states (Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia and Michigan).\nIt's important to recognise that politicians campaign to the system they are operating in - we cannot say that if the electoral system were different the result would definitely have been different since the candidates may well have campaigned accordingly.\nCould you win a UK general election without winning the popular vote? Absolutely - it happened in 1951 and 1974.\nAs in the US, our first-past-the-post system means any votes you win in a seat where you don't have a majority effectively don't count - it doesn't matter whether you gain 40% or 4% of the votes.\nThere has been a long-running campaign in the UK to reform our electoral system. Campaigners have called for a system of proportional representation as far back as 1884.\nUnder the UK's multi-party system, in the most extreme case you could comfortably win the popular vote but get no seats in the House of Commons by coming second in every constituency.\nWhat is more common is to see a party winning a majority in Parliament with as little as 35% or 36% of the popular vote, as Labour did in 2005 and the Conservatives in 2015. In the 1950s and 1960s, winning parties averaged about 47%.\nAnd we can see the same kind of thing happening with the vote share of smaller parties.

Jack Wilshere, who missed almost the entire season, drags England's averages down but, even if the Arsenal midfielder had played a full campaign, England would still be behind Spain and France.\nAs it is, of the teams analysed, England's workload is greater than Italy, Wales and Northern Ireland's, but, in the case of the latter two, their squad includes more players who are not first-team regulars for their clubs.\nThe Premier League does, however, provide the three individuals to have played the most football this season from the nations analysed.\nManchester United pair Chris Smalling and Anthony Martial and Liverpool defender Nathaniel Clyne have completed the most domestic minutes on the field.\nHowever, the difference in workload between the players at top of the list is minimal, so it is perhaps better to look at trends within squads.\nHere, England's players are once again shown not to get through more work than their rivals.\nOf Hodgson's men, 13 have played 40 or more games, compared to 18 in the Spain squad and 13 each from France and Germany.\nThe Spanish total could be explained by three La Liga teams  - Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid and Sevilla - making European finals and the fact that Barcelona, with other international commitments, played more games than any other team on the continent last season.\nStill, those clubs were not involved in the sort of squad rotation that saw Liverpool, the other team to reach a European final, field virtually two different XIs in the Premier League and Europa League by the end of the season.\n\"There certainly is a culture of resting players in La Liga, with the question of possible 'rotaciones' always raised before every Barcelona and Real Madrid game,\" said Spanish football journalist Andy West.\n\"But perhaps a subtle difference is that squad rotations in Spain are generally carried out on a more selective basis, with only two or three changes made to a team rather than six or seven.\"\nEven if England's players do play less than their rivals, the notion that the Premier League, and even the Championship, are more physically demanding could negate the advantages of not spending as much time on the pitch.\nThis theory holds water, but only to a certain extent.\nPerformance analysts ProZone have studied the major leagues in Europe - the top flights of England, France, Germany, Spain and Italy - and provided evidence that the Premier League could be more physically demanding.\nFor instance, teams moving the ball quickly from one player to another, known as fast tempo possessions, are 20% higher in the Premier League than the European average.\n\"In 2015-16 the English Premier League was characterised by a much higher propensity for fast tempo and sustained offensive possessions when compared with the other major European leagues,\" said ProZone head of performance lab Paul Neilson.\n\"This data could support the view that the speed of the game in England is faster compared to other competitions, which may also link to higher physical demands and speed of decision-making.\"\nHowever, when it comes to counter-attacking, the Premier League is 16% down on the European average.\n\"Many people associate counter-attacks with high physical demands,\" Neilson said. \"However, it might also indicate the tactical importance within the Premier League of possession and not being caught out in transition - although this did not stop Leicester City exploiting this tactic very well.\"\nConclusion? Inconclusive.\nEven if we were to take the leap that the Premier League is more physically demanding than the rest of Europe, then we should also remember the effect that has on the rest of the teams at Euro 2016.\nThe Premier League is supplying 103 players to the tournament, some 81 who are not in the England squad.\n\"So many players from other nations at Euro 2016 play in the Premier League anyway,\" said former England midfielder Jermaine Jenas. \"Some of the top players too.\n\"Cristiano Ronaldo was with Manchester United for a number of years and he was still doing it for Portugal.\n\"N'Golo Kante has been playing the way he does week in, week out for Leicester all year but he does not look tired because he obviously trains hard and looks after himself. Him doing that for France won't be an issue.\"\nThe list of names who have called for a winter break in English football reads like a who's who of imported managers.\nAmong them are Arsene Wenger, Louis van Gaal, Jurgen Klopp, not to mention former national team bosses Capello and Eriksson, with the latter going so far as to say that England will struggle to win a tournament until one is introduced.\nWhile the intention here is not dismiss the positive effect a winter break may have on the collective freshness of the England squad in France, it can perhaps be demonstrated that Hodgson's squad are not so disadvantaged by the Premier League's refusal to fall in line with much of Europe.\nFirstly, the Premier League and Championship are supplying almost a quarter of the players to the tournament. Straight away, the England squad are on a par with the other 111 men not to have taken a break this season.\nIn terms of breaks taken by leagues across Europe, the hiatus of the Spanish top flight was cut to 10 days this season, about the same amount of time a Premier League team gets off if they fail to reach the fourth or fifth round of the FA Cup.\nAlso, consider this. If we are to take a typical winter break in Europe to last for around three weeks, then, according to physioroom.com, nine of the England squad have had the same amount of rest this season through the time they have spent out injured.\nTaking all breaks - scheduled and injury-enforced - into account, then 14 of the England squad have gone without a period of rest, a number not dramatically greater than the nine players in the France squad in a similar situation.\n\"A period of injury can be more restful than being fully fit,\" said injury data analyst Ben Dinnery. \"Not only because of the physical demands of the Premier League, but also the psychological aspect, travel, training and recovery, especially when there are two or three games a week.\n\"However, it's not as simple as saying an injury is as good as a break, it depends on the player and the type of injury sustained.\n\"Some players could work harder trying to get fit than they do when they are playing regularly, maybe doing two or three sessions a day.\"\nEven if some evidence suggests that England have no more reason to be fatigued at a major tournament that their rivals, the popular belief that they should be at a disadvantage is likely to remain.\n\"If you keep telling players they are tired, they will be tired,\" said former England striker Alan Shearer, who played in the European Championships of 1996 and 2000, as well as the 1998 World Cup.\n\"I didn't go into any tournament feeling tired, in fact I would actually say I always felt great. I would never use the excuse of being tired if I didn't play well.\"\nTo support Shearer's view, Smalling, the most worked man in our analysis, is not feeling any sense of fatigue before what will be his first appearance at a European Championship.\n\"When you get on a roll of games, you just want to keep going and I want to contribute to a successful summer,\" he said.\n\"When you've looked forward to something all season, you can't be tired when you've got such a massive carrot at the end of it. Now it's getting to the stage where the excitement will drive you through any tiredness.\"\nStill, if the scheduling and demands of domestic football do ultimately leave England at a disadvantage when compared to the rest of Europe, they can take inspiration from the Denmark team of 1992.\nWhile the story of the Danes lifting the trophy after being summoned as a late replacement for Yugoslavia is well known, what is not often documented is their own domestic season prior to the glory in Sweden.\nA restructuring meant the Danish top flight played a season in the summer of 1991 and immediately followed that with another campaign in 1991-92. More than half of the squad effectively played a season and a half before going on to be crowned European champions.\nSometimes, there really are no excuses.\nWho do you think should start at Euro 2016?

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.", "input": "Hughes was the deserved man of the match after tearing the Yorkshire side to shreds during Derby's 3-1 win in a match played in front of the television cameras earlier this month.\nThere was his wonderfully disguised threaded pass that led to Conor Sammon putting the Rams in front and a stand-out mazy run with the sort of tight control that hinted at a youth spent playing futsal. Countless times he knitted his team's play together; always finding space, always willing to take possession and shoulder responsibility.\nIn among the trickery and the attacking flair, what really caught the eye was a surging run back towards his own goal that eventually led to a sliding tackle - and with it the end of a promising Leeds attack.\nIt is the sort of form that has seen Hughes linked with a host of top-flight clubs and named as the Football League young player of the month for November.\nHughes was presented with his award at Derby's Moor Farm training ground on Thursday morning, his bleach blond hair standing out against the grey December sky.\nIt was his first award as a professional footballer and comes during a period of astounding progress for the modest and intelligent youngster.\nLast season he made two substitute appearances and one start for the first team. So far this season he has started every Derby fixture apart from the away game at Bolton in late August when he came on as a substitute.\nThere has been no sign of the inconsistency that tends to affect many young players in their breakthrough season and his ability to last the duration of a match has improved throughout the campaign.\n\"'Just give him the ball', that is what we tell the lads,\" Derby boss Nigel Clough told BBC Sport. \"They have the confidence to give him it all over the pitch.\n\"People say 'is he really only 17?'. It is like having a senior pro in the team. His composure belies his age and there are not many 17-year-olds in the country playing to the standard that he is; it sets him apart.\"\nHughes's instantly recognisably hairstyle might hint at a man keen to thrust himself into centre stage, but in conversation with him what stands out is his modesty and willingness to learn.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nHe loves to watch Spanish football, trying to pick out little bits from the likes of Xavi and Andres Iniesta, in particular their decision-making on the ball.\nAsk him to describe his best qualities as a footballer and the answer comes slowly, Hughes eventually opting for his technical and passing ability. Ask him what he can improve and the answer flows - his weaker foot (right), which he is working on after training, the physical aspects of his game, his strength and his speed.\nHughes made his debut for the England Under-21 team in November as a substitute in their fixture against Northern Ireland. In doing so he became the second-youngest player to represent the U-21s after Arsenal's Theo Walcott.\nGiven that Hughes went into pre-season focused on claiming a regular place on the bench, it is unsurprising that he is still trying to come to terms with the speed of his progression.\n\"This season has been a whirlwind,\" said Hughes. \"It is weird how fast everything has happened for me, I just could not see that. Over the last 12 months everything has rocketed. I still try to find time to keep in touch with my friends but it is difficult.\"\nHughes, a former pupil at Repton School, has just passed his driving test and has private tutoring at the club, studying A-levels in business studies and politics. He is trying to retain a sense of normality off the pitch.\nYet such has been his progress that he is already on his second professional contract - the initial deal he signed when he turned 17 quickly superseded by a new one in October that runs until 2015.\nEngland Under-21 boss Stuart Pearce\n\"Will's technically a very sound player. He rarely gave the ball away in training or in the game he played [against Northern Ireland], which is vitally important at international level. He's progressing really well.\"\nDerby academy director Darren Wassall\n\"For a 17-year-old to be playing in the first team of a Championship side is very unusual. I bet there are not many 17-year-olds playing at the level Will is week in, week out.\"\nDerby manager Nigel Clough\n\"To do what he has done at 17-and-a-half just goes to show the potential that he has got. \"\nThe danger is obvious. Increasingly he is being linked with top Premier League clubs - Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal among others - and Clough is clearly aware of the need to protect his player, to monitor his development and keep him grounded.\n\"One of the biggest dangers is money,\" added Clough. \"Once you put money into the hands of a 17-year-old, no matter how intelligent and mature they are, there is a chance of it going the wrong way.\"\nClough has told Hughes that if he can get this season and the next right, if he can keep focused and continue to improve, then money and all the other trappings commensurate with the modern footballer will look after themselves.\nBut Clough admits that Hughes seems so mature that he sometimes has to remind himself just how young the attacking midfielder is; still technically a minor who is not old enough to legally buy alcohol.\nHughes has a Twitter account, the mini-bio section of which simply reads 'Happiness is the key'. Why nothing about being a footballer?\n\"I do not want to put anything about football or seem arrogant. I'm still a 17-year-old lad and I have not done anything yet,\" he said.\nThat is not strictly true. In matter of months he has gone from relative obscurity to one of the hottest young properties in the Football League.\nOn Friday the Derby Academy, where most of his peers still play, breaks up for two weeks. There will be no such chance for Hughes to relax as he excitedly looks forward to his first Christmas as a professional.\nHe will spend the evening of 25 December in a hotel close to Burnley ahead of their game on Boxing Day against the Clarets. Will he spend the evening reading Barcelona's detailed dossier?\n\"That is all a bunch of lies, rumours, as are all the stories about me. I get told about them but they just go straight over my head,\" Hughes added.\nBBC Sport will be taking a closer look at stories from outside the Premier League before every weekend league programme in our Football League Friday features.", "output": "If reports are true and Barcelona have compiled a \"detailed dossier\" on Derby's 17-year-old midfielder Will Hughes then they must have filled a few pages on the back of his recent performance against Leeds.", "category": "Summarization 416.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an article.

But that stuff was always my secret. That was hidden away in the back pages.\nYou come from Hitchin in Hertfordshire. What was that like? Was there a lot of music at home?\nGrowing up in Hitchin was comfortable and easy enough. My parents had some great records - and some not-so-great ones - and that's where I got introduced to Motown and the Stones and Springsteen.\nThen me and my brother would play video games and listen to local radio. I loved pop music as a little kid. Things like the Black Eyed Peas. If it had a catchy chorus I was into it.\nHow did you start playing guitar?\nThere was a guitar that my uncle owned and never learnt to play. He sold it to my dad and when I heard Layla, that was the tune that really grabbed me. I said to my dad, \"wait, there's a guitar, right?\"\nI was a pretty obsessive kid and when I held it in my hands for the first time, I was away.\nThis was a bog-standard electric guitar?\nActually, it was a classic Spanish guitar with nylon strings. It was in bad shape but we got it fixed up.\nDid you teach yourself?\nYeah. The first thing I tried was a CD Rom \"how to play the guitar\" and, oh my God, was it boring. Then I tried lessons, but I didn't have the patience to sit in a class and wait my turn to play one chord.\nAnd suddenly the internet was there. YouTube was a new thing at this point and I could go and explore all this stuff [online guides] really easily.\nWhat was the first song you wrote and played to another person?\nI was playing in a lot of bands at that point, and one of the first songs we played was called It's Raining.

This guy walked in during the first song, got himself a drink and sat down in front of me. He had this big camera on his shoulder and suddenly he was filming me from two feet in front of the stage.\nI got chatting to him afterwards and he said, \"basically, I'm a cameraman and I liked your first song so I filmed the second two.\" We swapped details and he put one of the songs up on YouTube.\nA couple of months later a record label in New York found that video somehow, and they gave me a call. I had a manager at this point but they said, \"would you like to fly over to New York and have a chat?\"\nWhat were you doing at this point - working or gigging?\nIn all honesty, I'd had to go back to Hitchin. I did two bar jobs which I started and got fired from in about two months. But I held on to a third.\nIt was the best moment of my life when I said, \"Guys, I'm out. I'm going to New York and they want me to sign a deal\".\nThat cameraman will be after a finder's fee now. Are you still in touch?\nI don't even think the video's on YouTube any more.

So she was dissecting the lyrics to Let It Go in front of me, telling me her favourite lines in the verses.\nIt was bizarre. But she's an enormous pop star, so it's a really amazing bit of appreciation.\nImportant question: Why the hat? Are you, like The Edge, secretly bald \"up top\"?\nThere's no reason! I was living in Brighton, there was a shop called Mad Hatters and I'd seen one or two blues guys wearing these hats. So spur of the moment, I thought I'd give it a go. It hasn't come off my head yet.\nCurrently, the top Google result for James Bay is a body of water in Canada. At what point do you estimate you'll overtake it?\nHaha!

Might it tip the scales in a finely balanced vote, where divas and innocent celebrations of all things kitsch come face to face with brute realities of European political and cultural voting?\nDaniel Gould, a Eurovision analyst, envisages what could happen.\nEurovision's organising body, the EBU, did have an explanation for this year's surprise entrant. They said that as Australia had long broadcast the contest, extending an invitation chimed with this year's theme of Building Bridges.\nIt may also be far from Europe, but there was the sense that Australia is culturally close, as a home, after all, to many European immigrants.\nBut some Eurovision loyalists suspect a plan to expand the competition beyond fortress Europe and combined with the unstoppable force that is Australia - this means some nerves are fraying.\nOnce invited, the Australians just went for it. They picked one of their best singers, Guy Sebastian, the upbeat and bouncy winner of the Australian idol competition, who proved himself game by writing an entirely new set of songs in just 72 hours. The best one, a modern R&B number called Tonight Again, with echoes of the recent hit Uptown Funk, was chosen.\nHe travelled around Europe in a sustained charm offensive, regularly telling Europe how \"stoked\" he is to be there. U2's lighting designer Bruce Ramos is also on board for the stage show.\nAt the back of my mind is the comparison with the UK's somewhat more lackadaisical approach, which was to pick a singer who all four judges didn't turn around for in The Voice competition, in partnership with a teacher who is part of a Rolling Stones tribute band.\nThe novelty of Australia's participation got the attention of bookmakers. In a competition full of ballads, his decision to choose one that stood out against the sleepy ballads of other competitors, halved his odds again.\nHe started making promotional appearances, winning over crowds with his live performances and now Australia is third favourite to win, behind Sweden and Italy.\nBut it is not just the Australian singer who can make an impact. For the first time the Australian voting public has a say in the contest, too, and enthusiastic Australian audiences could be a hilariously disruptive force in voting.\nDiaspora voting has long been a powerful force in the televotes. Ever since, 2003 Turkey has never failed to score fewer than 91 points in a Eurovision final -  thanks to loyal immigrant populations.\nSo imagine these scenarios, which may never come to pass, but which could get the sweat trickling down the brows of Eurovision's traditional big hitters.\nScenario One: We're down to the final vote. Australia and Sweden top the scoreboard with the same amount of points, and the UK holds it all in the balance with their votes. They go for Australia, upsetting decades of quiet respect for their successful Scandinavian neighbours, and showing that loyalties may just lie with brethren thousands of miles away where historical ties run deep. The competitive Swedes hold a Eurovision grudge against the UK forever more. The UK's chances of ever winning again may just have died.\nScenario Two:  It's final vote time and this time the Australian public hold the balance of power. The massive Greek population in Australia kick into action and they vote Greece into the top place, giving joy to a nation searching for a way out of economic crisis. Perhaps Yanis Varoufakis, Greek finance minister and former Melbourne University professor, was high in their minds.\nScenario Three:  Australia also gets to vote in the two semi-finals, which they themselves by-pass with an automatic wildcard into the final. For most smaller European nations, participating in Saturday's extravaganza depends on finishing in the top 10 in the Tuesday or Thursday heats. Will the large Serbian population in Australia manage to sway the vote and push this outsider into the final from the Tuesday heat; and if so, at the expense of whom? Albania?\nTraditionally, the winner hosts the following year's show. Organisers have said that Australia cannot be a host, but their broadcaster SBS could co-organise the event with another European country where the contest would take place.\nPerhaps it will force countries like the UK to realise they need to up their Eurovision game once they've been shown exactly how it's done.", "output": "When Eurovision announced in February that Australia - which is distinctly not in Europe - would be taking part in this year's contest, diehard Eurovision fans thought April Fool's Day had come early.", "category": "Summarization 416.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an article.

The DNA profile was incomplete, however, and he was acquitted at Winchester Crown Court in 2012.\nWith no other suspects, the case was about to be effectively shelved in 2013 when Det Insp Martin Chudley, of Hampshire Constabulary, led a final review of the evidence.\n\"I always felt it was impossible that he left nothing behind,\" he said.\n\"It was a long, prolonged attack, he was there for quite some considerable time - I just couldn't conceive there wasn't a part of him there somewhere.\"\nForensic samples taken from Mrs Edmonds' trousers and the rolling pin had been thought to be the most likely to yield the killer's DNA as those were items which had clearly been touched.\nHamlen's DNA had been found on the rolling pin but had been mixed with that of Mrs Edmonds. This meant a full profile may have been there but was masked by their shared characteristics.\nAfter the acquittal, Det Insp Chudley asked scientists to re-examine samples taken from the original murder scene.\nHe was told it was \"unlikely to work\", but the team decided to examine some of the fibres from the back left sleeve of Ms Edmond's blouse. It proved crucial and in February 2014, a full profile of Hamlen's DNA was identified.\nThe Court of Appeal subsequently quashed the original not guilty verdict, paving the way for Hamlen, 36, to be put on trial for murder for a second time.\nThis time the DNA evidence was strong enough, along with mobile phone evidence, for the prosecution to place him at the murder scene.\nHis mobile phone had been used nearby, close to the time of the murder, and again near to where Mrs Edmonds' mobile had been switched on and then discarded.\nForensic scientist Geraldine Davidson told jurors the material found on the blouse was 26 million times more likely to have come from Hamlen than someone else.\nThe prosecution alleged he had targeted her for her money. Hamlen had a history of domestic violence and cocaine use, was suspected of dealing drugs and was thought to be considerably in debt.\nHowever, he flatly denied any involvement in the killing.\n\"I know I didn't do this, I could not do something like this,\" he told the court. \"As far as the DNA goes, I'm not an expert. All I can tell you is, it didn't get there at the time, if it is mine.\"\nFor Mrs Edmonds' family, who were left without the closure of a conviction in 2012, the guilty verdict marks the end of what her daughter Doddie described as a \"long road\".\n\"I try not to dwell on the details of the actual murder - she was hurt so badly and how terrified she must have been.

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence.", "input": "Now they've seen the details, they haven't changed their tune.\nThere is actually a fair amount of common ground between the two sides, but the details - naturally - matter.\nThe EU's goal on citizens' rights, said its chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, is \"the same level of protection as [is offered] in EU law\".\n\"More ambition, clarity and guarantees needed than in today's UK position,\" Mr Barnier tweeted.\nThis is a crucial point for the European negotiating team.\nHowever pleased it may be that the UK has finally produced a detailed policy document on one aspect of Brexit, this proposal falls short of what it wants in several respects.\nThe EU's Essential Principles on Citizens' Rights argued that the rights of EU citizens in the UK, and British citizens elsewhere in the EU, should not change as a result of Brexit.\nAll their rights should be respected.\nThe British proposal, on the other hand, entails the loss of some of those rights - the legal protection of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), for example, or the unconditional right to bring family members into the UK from third countries.\nThe cut-off date for eligibility for settled status also needs to be clarified. The UK proposal suggests that the cut-off could be as early as 29 March 2017, the day when Article 50 was triggered.\nBut it is unlikely that the EU would be willing to agree to any date that has already passed. It would mean - in effect - that some citizens would lose some of their rights while the UK was still a member of the EU.\nOpposition to such an idea would be seen in many EU capitals not just as a point of principle, but as a matter of EU law.\nIt is more likely that British negotiators will eventually agree to settle on their other suggested date - the date on which the UK actually leaves the EU, which is currently due to be 29 March 2019.\nIf the UK shows flexibility on the cut-off date, it will expect equal flexibility on other matters from the EU. But trust between the negotiating teams appears to be in rather short supply.\nIt will need to be established quickly because a similar mood of compromise will be needed to reach agreement on the legal system that will underpin any agreement.\nThe British side insists that the ECJ will have no jurisdiction in the UK after Brexit. The EU insists that the ECJ must continue to offer legal protection for their citizens in the UK, just as it does now.\nThe obvious answer to this conundrum is to create a joint UK-EU arbitration panel that will ensure that the terms of an agreement are respected under international law. But this will require both sides to alter fairly entrenched positions.\nWell, the UK proposal does contain a few carrots.\nIt accepts that child benefit payments will still be paid for the children of EU workers in the UK whose families live abroad. This was a right that David Cameron tried but failed to abolish.\nIt advocates a \"grace period\" of two years to allow EU citizens to get their status in order. It is an idea that could dovetail conveniently with the need for transitional arrangements, to ensure that the British exit from the EU takes place without sudden shocks.\nAs for British citizens who have retired abroad, the UK proposal offers the reassurance that the government will continue to export and \"uprate\" the UK state pension within the EU.\nSo if, for example, you live in Spain, you will still get annual pension increases - something that is not always guaranteed if you live elsewhere in the world.\nThere is also a promise to simplify bureaucratic procedures for people applying for settled status in the future. But many of them will be furious that they have just spent time and money to obtain permanent residence in the UK, only to find out that they need to start again from scratch.\n\"How can you promise to give people certainty and then tell tens of thousands that their permanent residence is going to be invalidated?\" says Ian Robinson, a partner at the immigration law firm Fragomen.\n\"It would have been just as easy to continue to recognise permanent residence already granted but just stop accepting new applications,\" Mr Robinson adds.\nThe UK may argue that its proposal at least tries to offer something to everyone. But so far it doesn't do enough to satisfy the EU.\nSo even if the basis for a deal can be envisaged on this one aspect of Brexit, there is plenty of bridge-building still to be done.\nWhen the UK proposal was first trailed, it was described as a generous offer. That was quickly amended to a \"fair and serious\" one.\nBecause the EU doesn't see this as a generous offer, and it has been prepared to say so. It involves millions of EU citizens losing some of the rights they currently enjoy, and for EU leaders that is no cause for celebration.\nRead more from Reality Check\nFollow us on Twitter", "output": "When British Prime Minister Theresa May first trailed the Conservative Party's proposals for EU citizens living in the UK at last week's EU summit, the initial response from her fellow leaders was hardly enthusiastic.", "category": "Summarization 416.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an article.

If that is the case, the feasibility of a bucardo recovery plan will be discussed,\" Dr Fernandez-Arias, who is head of the Aragon Hunting, Fishing and Wetlands Service, explained.\nThe bucardo (Capra pyrenaica pyrenaica) was a sub-species of ibex, with distinct physical and genetic characteristics to other mountain goats inhabiting the Iberian Peninsula. It was perfectly adapted to life in its mountain habitat, and to survive the extreme cold and snow of winter in the Pyrenees.\nHowever, its population had been declining for years for several reasons, including hunting. In April 1999, researchers captured the last animal, a female named Celia. They obtained skin biopsies and froze the tissue in liquid nitrogen at a temperature of -196C (-321F).\nThe following year, Celia was killed by a falling tree in the National Park of Ordesa in north-east Spain. But a team including Dr Fernandez-Arias, Jose Folch and others were able to inject nuclei from Celia's preserved cells into goat eggs that had been emptied of their own DNA.\nThen they implanted the eggs into surrogates - hybrids between Spanish ibex and domestic goats. Of 57 implantations, seven animals became pregnant and one was carried to term.\nThe baby bucardo was born in 2003 - the first successful \"de-extinction\". But the clone of Celia died a few minutes later due to a defect in one of its lungs. Earlier this year, Dr Fernandez-Arias related the story in a TEDx talk, as part of a meeting on de-extinction.\nEven if the new effort succeeds in producing healthy clones, any future recovery plan for the bucardo would be fraught with difficulty - especially given the only frozen tissue is from a lone female.\nOne possible approach for bringing back the bucardo might be to cross a healthy female bucardo clone with a closely related sub-species - such as the Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica hispanica) or the Gredos ibex (Capra pyrenaica victoriae) - and then selectively breeding the offspring to enhance traits typical of the bucardo.\nSeveral other possibilities could also be explored. For instance, researchers have been able to reverse the sex of female mouse embryos by introducing a key gene that makes them develop as males.\nIn addition, George Church, professor of genetics at Harvard University, explained that a technique known as Crispr opened up new opportunities in the field of endangered species conservation and de-extinction. The technique allows researchers to edit genomes with extraordinary precision.\nSuch \"genome editing\" techniques could be used to introduce genetic diversity in populations that are so closely related it poses a threat to their survival.\n\"In some cases, you have a hunch as to what diversity is needed. You might specifically want diversity in the major histocompatibility complex [a large gene family involved in immune responses],\" Prof Church told BBC News.\n\"For example, part of the problem with the Tasmanian devil is that they are so closely related in terms of their immune system that they have problems rejecting the facial tumour cells that they spread by biting each other.\"\nHowever, he said, such techniques might eventually offer a way to extensively edit the genome of an Asian elephant to make it more like a mammoth, using a genetic sequence from the extinct animals.\nCommenting on plans for the bucardo cells, the Aragon Hunting Federation said it wanted to \"develop initiatives in the field of ecology in order to defend the natural environment\".\nThe sum provided to fund the research at CITA has not been disclosed.\nPaul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter", "output": "Scientists in Spain have received funding to test whether an extinct mountain goat can be cloned from preserved cells.", "category": "Summarization 416.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an article.

The first person is the \"trustee\" and the second is the \"beneficiary\". Company pension schemes are a common example of a trust.\nWith EBTs, the employer deposits money in to the trust, which is paid out to the beneficiaries in the form of tax-free loans.\nTrusts are often postponed and are sometimes refused by the trustee, who is, in theory, acting independently of the employer.\nIn many cases, the loans are never repaid.\nWhy are Rangers in a court dispute with HMRC over EBTs?\nPayments from an EBT should not be made on a contractual basis, as it would make them part of an employee's salary and subject to tax and National Insurance.\nHMRC claims that Rangers' EBT scheme was a tax scam as it was contractual, which forms the basis of the so-called \"Big Tax Case\".\nHMRC also insists it has proof of this in the form of documents and emails between former directors at Rangers and players' agents.\nIn 2010, HMRC issued Rangers with a bill for \u00a335m in unpaid tax and interest, and \u00a314m in penalties which Rangers challenged at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, but the verdict has not been announced.\nHave any other Scottish football clubs been involved with EBT schemes?\nBBC Scotland Investigates wrote to all of the Scottish Premier League's member clubs and asked whether they had ever operated an EBT scheme.\nCeltic confirmed that it established one EBT scheme in April 2005, which BBC Scotland understands was for the benefit of the Brazilian midfielder Juninho Paulista. The scheme was worth \u00a3765,000 but the club did not declare the trust payment to the Scottish Football Association or the Scottish Premier League.\nThe payments made to the trust were declared in Celtic's annual report for 2004/2005, but in 2008 the club became aware of an event giving rise to a potential tax liability which was subsequently paid after agreement with HMRC.\nThe remaining 10 SPL clubs replied and confirmed they had never set up an EBT scheme for any of their employees.\nWho set up the EBT scheme for Rangers and the Murray Group?\nA former lawyer who advised companies on tax strategy known as Paul Baxendale-Walker. He was struck off the roll of solicitors by a disciplinary tribunal in 2007. Mr Baxendale-Walker is the author of two books on EBT tax strategies and advised Rangers on how to set the scheme up and operate it.\nHe subsequently became involved in the porn industry, producing, directing and acting in films under the name Paul Chaplin.\nHow much did Rangers and the Murray Group pay into their EBT schemes?\nBetween 2001 and 2010, Rangers paid a total of \u00a347.65m in to their Employee Benefit Trust. Details of the amounts paid in to the trust were declared in the club's annual accounts.\nRangers also operated another tax avoidance scheme for two former players, Tore Andre Flo and Ronald De Boer, between 2000-01 and 2002-03 known as a 'Discounted Options Scheme' - commonly referred to as the \"Wee Tax Case\". HMRC issued Rangers with a bill of about \u00a34m for outstanding amounts owed from the discounted options tax scheme, which was settled, but has not been paid.\nBBC Scotland understands the Murray Group paid at least \u00a310m to the trust.\nHow many beneficiaries were involved the Rangers EBT scheme?\nA total of 111 sub-trusts were set up between 2001-2010 for Rangers directors, players and other staff - along with employees of Murray International Holdings and its subsidiary companies.\nA total of 53 Rangers players and staff received side contracts giving undertakings to fund their sub-trusts with cash, according to documents seen by BBC Scotland.\nHow much money did the beneficiaries withdraw in loans from the scheme?\nThe amounts varied from a total of \u00a36.3m received by Sir David Murray to \u00a37,500 for Bellshill-born defender Steven Smith, who left the club in 2011.\nFormer Rangers captain Barry Ferguson received a total of \u00a32.5m while ex-Ibrox player/manager Graeme Souness received \u00a330,000 from the scheme almost 10 years after leaving the club.\nThe average amount received by Rangers and Murray Group employees was about \u00a3445,000.\nWhat if Rangers players have received side-letters?\nBBC Scotland has also seen evidence, which was submitted to a court, suggesting that 53 Rangers players and staff had side-letters giving undertakings to fund their sub-trusts with cash.\nAccording to the Scottish Football Association's registration rules, payments received by a player solely relating to his playing activities must be fully recorded and declared, otherwise the player has been improperly registered.\nIf a player is deemed to be improperly registered, the norm is for his team to forfeit any match in which he has participated.\nSo, could Rangers be stripped of past titles and trophies?\nPrecedence exists for this kind of rule-breaking and subsequent punishment in football and other sports.\nIn 1994, Marseilles were found guilty of financial irregularities and a match fixing scandal involving then president Bernard Tapie.\nThe French club was forcibly relegated to Ligue 1 and lost its 1992-93 Division One title and the right to play in the Champions League in 1993-94, the 1993 European Super Cup and the 1993 Intercontinental Cup.\nRangers: The Men Who Sold the Jerseys was broadcast on BBC One Scotland on Wednesday 23 May, and will be available afterwards for one week on the iPlayer.", "output": "BBC Scotland examines the Murray Group Remuneration Trust scheme.", "category": "Summarization 416.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an article.

This is in an insect, this is a head louse.\"\nThe discovery prompted a ritual familiar to millions of parents around the world - John's mother and father bought an over-the-counter chemical treatment, and \"bug bombed\" his head.\n\"But it didn't work,\" says John's mum Jerri.\nWhile exact statistics are hard to come by, getting head lice is a rite of passage for most schoolchildren.\nIn the US alone, as many as 12 million kids per year get an infestation, according to the federal public health body, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nMeanwhile, a 2011 survey found that one third of under-16s in the UK had caught head lice in the previous 12 months.\nThe problem for families trying to get rid of head lice is that over the past few decades the insects have built up a resistance to many of the available pesticide treatments.\nSo simply spraying or shampooing your child's hair with one of these products can often not work against these toughened \"super lice\".\nThankfully for stressed-out mums and dads - and itchy children - in recent years a new industry has built up on both sides of the Atlantic as a response: professional head lice removal companies.\nOne such business is Lice Happens, based in Annapolis, Maryland, an hour's drive east of US capital Washington DC.\nThe firm, who came to the rescue of John and his mum, runs a 24-hour emergency \"lice line\".\nOnce a time has been arranged, Lice Happens will visit a family's home.\nWearing special headsets fitted with magnifying glasses, staff are armed with professional grade \"nit combs\", and use a pesticide-free and non-toxic spray to loosen and comb out both lice and their eggs (nits).\nAn average session costs from $300 (\u00a3244), and all family members are screened.\n\"It only takes one appointment,\" says Lice Happens' owner Nancy Fields, who set up the business in 2008.\n\"And while we work we educate, because there is so much misinformation out there. We make sure people understand fact from fiction, and give them hands-on training.\n\"We show parents how to accurately screen their children, and if they find they have to deal with lice again, we remind them of their training, and guide them so they don't have to throw more money at it.\n\"Instead of looking at it as an expense, it's a one-time investment.\"\nMs Fields decided to set up Lice Happens after helping her sister battle an infestation. \"My sister was doing everything she could, but it didn't work,\" she says.\n\"She was also having to take unpaid leave from a new job to look after her children because the school wouldn't admit them while they were infected.\n\"It got me thinking that there has to be a better process, and that inspired me to think about starting a service to help people like my sister.\"\nMs Fields and her business partner MJ Eckert have since grown the business by selling area franchises for $29,000.\nThere are now eight franchises across the US, and about 50 people employed in the business.\nMs Fields says: \"We're picky about who we're going to award a franchise to.\n\"It's not just about nit picking anymore, it's about supporting people who have invested a considerable amount of money, and that's a lot of responsibility.\"\nMs Fields adds that she and Ms Eckert now make six-figure annual salaries.\n\"It's not like we've won the lottery, but we're able to pay our bills,\" she says.\nIn the UK, another head lice removal business expanding via the franchise model is The Hairforce, which was set up in 2006 by Dee Wright.\nShe says she was inspired to set up the company after reading an article about a US lice removal business.\nThe Hairforce takes a hi-tech approach, and its \"crack squad of lice assassins\" get rid of lice using a three-stage process. First they use a handheld vacuum system to gently suck out any living lice.\nThen they use heated air to dehydrate and destroy all the eggs, and finally they apply a natural hair conditioner and use nit combs to remove everything.\n\"The conditioner is just to remove any static energy, and lubricate the hairs to prevent any from tearing,\" says Ms Wright.\nThe first appointment lasts for 90 minutes, and costs \u00a3100. A week later the three stages are repeated in a second appointment that costs \u00a350.\nAfter establishing the business in north London, it has now spread across the UK. Employing 30 people, Ms Wright says the company treats \"thousands\" of people every week.\n\"We really do fulfil a real need,\" she says. \"We see mums and dads who have spent a fortune on expensive lotions that just haven't worked, and they come to us very upset and stressed, their children bullied at school.\n\"What we see is children transformed from the first to the second appointment.

Beaches were left knee-deep in sludge and thousands of sea birds were killed in what remains the UK's worst environmental accident.\nIt was the first major oil spill in British and European waters, causing enormous damage to marine life and the livelihoods of local people. It also led to changes in the way people viewed the environment.\nBrittany, in northern France, bore the brunt of the thickest part of the slick, and it became known there as the mar\u00c3\u00a9e noire, or \"black tide\".\nMore than 15,000 sea birds were killed. Clogged up with thick viscous oil, they were washed up both dead and alive on the shores. Future populations of some species took decades to recover.\nHeathrow's death sentence for villages\nStreet art: Crime, grime or sublime?\nWhy do people holiday in Scarborough?\nThis destruction of the birds had a direct impact on sanitation. Many were scavengers, eating rubbish which washed up on shore. That rubbish was instead left to rot on the beaches.\nThe deaths of birds and marine mammals in the first days after the spill were only a fraction of the final toll. The effects went on for years, working on organisms from the bottom of the food chain - the plankton and small invertebrates that live in sediments, through mussels and clams on up to fish, birds and mammals.\nAnd the British clean-up effort, which involved the excessive and indiscriminate use of powerful chemicals, made a bad situation much worse.\nAt the time, the Ministry for Agriculture and Fisheries determined that the holiday industry - and clean beaches - were more important than the \"very small\" amount of damage it anticipated to wildlife.\nSo more than two million gallons of a chemical called BP 1002 was sprayed on to the affected waters. Hoses were squirted over beaches, volunteers used watering cans, fishermen pumped the chemical into the sea from their boats. The Army even punctured holes into barrels of it and rolled them off cliffs.\nThe plan was for the chemical to break down the oil and allow it to disperse and be removed by natural bacteria. But instead it killed any kind of marine life it came into contact with, from seaweed to limpets to fish.\nIt pooled on beaches for hours before being washed away by the tide, making the poisonous effects even worse. A Marine Biological Association (MBA) report in 1968 said the UK's use of detergents resulted \"in the death of a large number of shore organisms of many kinds\".\nIt took 13-15 years for the treated areas to recover, about five times longer than those areas where the oil was dispersed naturally by wind and waves.\nProfessor Martin Attrill, director of the Marine Institute in Plymouth, said the British response to the crisis illustrates how different attitudes to the environment were then.\n\"At the time the Torrey Canyon went down we were still considering the sea as the main place to put all our waste,\" he said.\n\"We've had a change in mindset. At the time it was 'the environment can deal with this' and the main concern was for the ship and whether it could be salvaged.\n\"Then people started to wake up - not just to the environment, but to the fact it reduced tourism. People didn't want to visit areas where there'd been an oil spill, there was an inability to sell goods, the brand was tarnished. Now we know about the benefits of clean seas.\"\nOn the affected section of the Breton coast, breeding pairs had returned from their migration to nest when the disaster happened. The Ligue pour la Protection des Oiseaux calculated that there were 450 pairs of razorbills before the spill but only 50 after. For guillemots the number of pairs fell from 270 to 50.\nAbout 85% of puffins on the French coast were also killed, the RSPB estimated. Because of their low reproductive rate, it took several decades for the population to recover.\nJulian May was an 11-year-old boy on holiday in Cornwall when the disaster struck. He remembers the surf being like \"brown, frothy coffee\".\n\"On the beach itself there were thick clags of oil, great lumps of it,\" he said. \"It was spreading all over the place.\n\"More than anything, I remember the smell - the strange smell - of this oil.\"\nDr Gerald Boalch was a senior scientist aboard an MBA ship which took samples shortly after the spill.\n\"On British beaches where the detergents were used, many animals and plants were killed,\" he said. \"Spraying the detergents was definitely the wrong thing to do.\n\"It broke up the oil, which helped the tourism industry for the affected places, but the oil sank from the top of the waves to the bottom, breaking into smaller parts and being ingested by marine life.\"\nIn Cornwall, former biology teacher Richard Pearce from Treburrick has studied Porth Mear beach three times a year since the Torrey Canyon's murky load came ashore.\nHe said it took about five years for the environment to even \"stabilise\". Before that, he said, the beach was \"barren\".\nSo how had this disaster happened?\nThe Torrey Canyon had been en route from Kuwait to Milford Haven, in Pembrokeshire, on the morning of 18 March 1967 when its captain took a shortcut and hit Pollard's Rock - a reef between Land's End and the Isles of Scilly.\nEvery drop of the crude oil borne by the ship seeped into the Atlantic.\nBy evening an eight-mile slick had seeped from her ripped hull. The following day it was 20 miles long. It eventually bled into a 270 sq m (700 km2) foul-smelling smear.\nAfter failed attempts to shift the tanker off the rocks, the crew were rescued by lifeboats.\nThen the British government ordered the marooned tanker be bombed, both to burn off the remaining oil and to scuttle the vessel.\nOver two days, 62,000 lbs of explosives were dropped on the stricken craft and surrounding waters, along with 5,200 gallons of petrol, 11 high-powered rockets and napalm.\nOf the 42 bombs aimed at the target, about a quarter missed. Others did not explode. And while some of the oil burned, waves kept extinguishing the flames.\nJohn Eatwell, who took part in the bombing missions, said his abiding memory was of the \"overpowering smell of oil, which penetrated the cockpit even at several thousand feet above the slick\".\n\"The column of smoke from the burning oil went up to about 20,000 ft. To continue bombing we had to dive into smoke and flame,\" he said.\nThe Torrey Canyon broke in two and finally sank 12 days after it ran aground.\nThe approach in France was perhaps less scientific, but much kinder to nature.\nThe French let the oil come ashore and then scooped it up. On their rocky beaches, the oil that remained gradually weathered and the marine life was not as badly affected.\nMeanwhile on Guernsey, the oil hit the shore seven days after the Torrey Canyon finally sank.\nThe island was heavily dependent on tourism and officials were keen to clear the beaches as quickly as possible. The chosen solution was to suck the oil into sewage tankers, transport it to a disused quarry and dump it there.\nYears later, micro-organisms were introduced in the hope they would convert the oil over time into water and carbon dioxide. However, this had limited success.\n\"I don't think they'd have ever imagined that 50 years later the oil would still be there,\" said Rob Roussel, who oversees the quarry for the Guernsey government.\n\"At the time there was no awareness about how to deal with it, and the over-riding concern was the economy, so it was all about clearing the beaches as quickly as possible.\n\"We would have expected that the oil would have all been released by now but it continues to appear.\"\nThe Torrey Canyon disaster did have some positive consequences, including the creation of maritime regulations on pollution.\nA young David Bellamy, at the time an environmental consultant, was asked to comment on the disaster - and his unique style led to a career in television.\nSpeaking 50 years later, he said: \"The Torrey Canyon Disaster was a milestone in the environmental world.\n\"It was a tragedy that [it] had to happen before the public became focussed on potential loss of natural life, in this case marine.\n\"The media images of pollution and the attendant wildlife disasters made people begin to become involved in this new ethical conservation.\n\"It also became apparent that life is more resilient than anybody thought. In general if an oil spill is contained, the marine flora and flora will eventually return.\"\nThe International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation (ITOPF) was set up in direct response to the Torrey Canyon disaster. It now provides emergency responses to spills across the world.\nSingle hull oil tankers - where one hole could lead to a catastrophic leak - were phased out and replaced with double hulls, which offered more protection.\nThe American owners of the Torrey Canyon eventually paid \u00c2\u00a33m compensation to the British government. The accident remains the worst - and most expensive - in UK waters.\nAs for the Torrey Canyon herself, she still rests at the bottom of the ocean. The tanker which destroyed so much is now - somewhat ironically - a haven for marine life.", "output": "Additional reporting by Chris Quevatre", "category": "Summarization 416.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an article.

You need to have a system of discipline supported by good people in command who can spot where a problem is evolving and take steps to deal with it.\"\nHe rejected the idea of a bullying culture within the armed forces.\n\"You can't go ahead with people being bullied into doing things. I'm not saying bullies don't exist. Sometimes the worst bullies in peacetime turn out to be the best soldiers - its a judgement on how you deal with that and that's why you need an effective commanding officer.\"\nLast year the House of Commons defence committee found personnel were reluctant to make complaints about their superior officers.\nA Ministry of Defence (MoD) spokesman said it had a \"a zero tolerance approach to all forms of bullying, discrimination and abuse\".\n\"Any allegation of rape is taken extremely seriously, thoroughly investigated and appropriate action will be taken.\n\"We recognise that it takes great courage for any individual to come forward and report a sexual offence,\" he added.\nHe said the MoD had worked to improve service personnel's knowledge of how to report concerns and what support is available.\nFor Ms Swain, the inquest is a chance to offer hope to other service personnel.\n\"Anne-Marie was begging for help and support and no-one listened to her.

Then, I had friends sending me texts to tell me what they'd written about me.\n\"I spent one-and-half hours in the mixed zone after my qualification because I couldn't walk through without the media saying, 'Darya, Darya please stop'. I felt like I was being pulled left, right and centre. Everybody wanted to ask me about the situation with the Russia doping ban.\n\"I felt alone at the Games, anyway, and this made matters worse.

I thought it was impossible without drugs.\n\"I kept practising and practising. I didn't make huge improvements, but managed a Russia youth record of 6.52m. I was so happy. And then I leapt to 7.03m - the first time in my life over 7m!\n\"I thought: Life is perfect. You can train and compete without taking illegal substances.\n\"I think I've become mentally stronger during the past year - I feel older than the 26 years I am. The experience was bad, but it's made me tougher.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"I'm excited about competing in London. I don't like the fact I won't be wearing Russia colours, but this is the situation and we all know that we are from Russia.\n\"If I win and do a lap of honour, I won't be able to accept a Russia flag if someone hands it to me. I don't want another problem.\n\"But how will it look to the Russian public if I refuse the flag? What will they think? Maybe I won't do a victory lap and just stay in the competition area!\n\"It'll be a tough competition with Americans Brittney Reese and Tianna Bartoletta, but you just think about yourself and not about anybody else.

Labour insiders estimate making it non-automatic would cost the party about \u00c2\u00a35m.\nIn his speech in London, Mr Miliband proposed that only those union members who \"deliberately\" chose to join the party in future would do so.\nThe announcement came after Unite, one of the party's biggest donors, was accused of signing up its members to Labour in Falkirk -  some without their knowledge - in an effort to get its preferred candidate selected.\nMr Miliband promised to make politics more \"open, transparent and trusted\" by creating a \"modern\" relationship with trade unions, saying he wanted \"to take action and seize the moment that Falkirk represents\".\nThe changes would be introduced as \"soon as possible\" and definitely before the next general election, Mr Miliband said. An aide later said this should happen \"within months, rather than years\".\nBut Mr McCluskey told BBC Radio 4's World at One there was \"no civil war\" within the Labour movement.\nHe added that, in his speech, Mr Miliband \"did not mention anything\" about losing the political levy from unions, which \"would stay as it is\".\nInstead, Mr McCluskey argued, the Labour leader wanted to add a \"second option\", allowing union members to become an associate member of Labour - allowing them to show a stronger commitment to the party.\nGMB general secretary Paul Kenny said Mr Miliband's proposal would reduce Labour's funding \"by a very significant but as yet unquantified amount\".\nHe also said: \"The announcement contains a large number of new Labour Party policies which as yet are completely without the necessary substance that is required to see if they are workable.\"\nBy Nick RobinsonPolitical editor\nIn his speech, Mr Miliband said: \"What we saw in Falkirk is part of the death throes of the old politics.

The idea was that the drones would transport the equipment faster than an ambulance could.\n\"When you have a tool like this you can really allow the operators of those emergency services to add an entirely new dimension to the set of tools and solutions that they can think of,\" said Dave Voss, incoming leader of Project Wing.\nThe prototype vehicles that the company has built have successfully been tested by delivering packages to remote farms in Queensland, Australia, from neighbouring properties.\nAustralia was selected as a test site due to what Google calls \"progressive\" rules about the use of drones, which are more tightly controlled in other parts of the world.\nProject Wing's aircraft have a wingspan of approximately 1.5m (4.9ft) and have four electrically driven propellers.\nThe total weight, including the package to be delivered, is approximately 10kg (22lb). The aircraft itself accounts for the bulk of that at 8.5kg (18.7lb).\nThe small, white glossy machine has a \"blended wing\" design where the entire body of the aircraft provides lift.\nThe vehicle is known as a \"tail sitter\" - since it rests on the ground with its propellers pointed straight up, but then transitions into a horizontal flight pattern.\nThis dual mode operation gives the self-flying vehicle some of the benefits of both planes and helicopters.\nIt can take off or land without a runway, and can hold its position hovering in one spot. It can also fly quickly and efficiently, allowing it to cover larger distances than the more traditional quadcopter vehicles available commercially.\nThe vehicles are pre-programmed with a destination, but then left to fly themselves there automatically.\nThis differs from many military drone aircraft, which are often remotely controlled by a pilot on the ground, sometimes on the other side of the world.\nEventually Google said it could use unmanned flying vehicles to deliver shopping items to consumers at home.
