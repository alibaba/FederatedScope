Make sure that Object X and Y have the same number e.g. when ObjectX is singular, Object Y must be singular, too. The two objects (Object X & Object Y) should be used ONCE in your question. Here is a list of attributes and associated pair of contrastive words which may be used to create a valid question using the objects. You can use either of the contrastive words, but not both. You should think about more such attributes and associated words and use them in your question.\n| Attribute | triggerword | contrastive triggerword | \n| age | old | new | \n| altitude | low | high |\n| area | small | vast | \n| brightness | dark | light | \n| clarity | obscure | clear | \n| cleanness | dirty | clean | \n| complexity | simple | complex | \n| cost | cheap | expensive |\n| density | sparse | dense |\n| depth | shallow | deep |\n| distance | near | far |  \n| electric conductivity | low | high |\n| flexibility | rigid | flexible |\n| granularity | fine | coarse | \n| hardness | soft | hard | \n| length | short | long | \n| magnitude | small | large | \n| mass | small | large | \n| odor | weak | strong | \n| pressure | low | high | \n| resistance | low | high | \n| shape | round | sharp |\n| shape | flat | spiky |\n| size | small | large | \n| sound | quiet | loud | \n| sound pitch | low | high | \n| speed | slow | fast | \n| stability | unstable | stable | \n| strength | weak | strong | \n| temperature | low | high | \n| texture | smooth | rough | \n| thermal conductivity | low | high |\n| thickness | thin | thick | \n| volume | small | large |\n| weight | light | heavy | \n| width | narrow | wide | \n| location | in | out |\n| location | up | down |\n| location | above | below |\n| location | on | off |\n| location | to | from |\n", "input": "Context Word: mastering.", "output": "After mastering the harp, the musician moved onto the trumpet, because the _ bored them now.", "category": "Question Generation 30.json"}, {"instruction": "You are asked to create a question containing a blank (_), based on the given context word. Your question must contain two related but different objects; for example \"trophy\" and \"suitcase\". The expected answer to your question must be one of the objects present in the sentence. The expected answer must not be associated with any specific word in the question; instead it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be equally likely to fill the blank. For your question, there should be a agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use animals or proper nouns (e.g., New York, Macbook, Jeff Bezos, McDonald's, ...) as your objects. Avoid repeating the same style, pattern or phrases in each question, try to increase diversity by varying sentence structure, blank placement etc. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the question. Your question must contain only one blank.
