For the record, I've had 5 hour energy, and that tastes FAR worse. I will put up the taste for the results. It's got 150mg of caffeine, which is the equivalent of the big red bulls and monsters. I can't stand sucralose and sugar substitutes, and this is one of the only shot sized energy drinks that has only sugar in it. The sugar is at 9g, which isn't horrible. I used to drink 4 16oz.

I found that the bag's expansion--or not---has little to do with whether they are done. I have a 1200 watt microwave and 1:30 was perfect. 1:00 and they were not cooked, 2:00 and I had charcoal bits. I had to sacrifice a couple of precious bags to figure this out.  Taste and texture? Well they are infinitely better than bags of pork rinds from the store. The texture is very good. The taste? I am in no way shy of salty food, love me some salt! But these were borderline too much for me. I did sprinkle some cinnamon and Ideal on them to make them sweet and I still had a hard time eating them. My husband liked them this way though.  If they could back off the strong salty flavor, I would buy these again. As it is, I'm going to use them to make low-carb nachos. I won't be reordering them though. Love the crispy texture!

Wowee, Fattoush is now my favorite salad, I've eaten so often lately that the tart lemon-y dressing has made the corners of my mouth turn a bit pinkish and raw, youch. I tend to do that, find a food I really like, then eat it so much I almost make myself sick on it.  Anyways, the Fattoush salad dressing, with it's complex blend of Sumac, olive oil and various herbs and spices required one half teaspoon of pomegranate molasses.  I was lucky enough to find it at a Russian grocery store (YAY!).  But the store is far away and so I had to look around online to buy more, thank God for Amazon.  Now, granted, my bottle will likely last years if all I do with it is make Fattoush, one goopy half teaspon at a time, so I've used it in a few other things.  I added a teaspoon to a Lemon Chicken Marinade, a tiny glob to a bowl of greek yogurt (had to add honey too cuz it was sour!),  a tiny amount added to Christmas Salmon cream cheese log, I used it in Fesenjen, a persian stew of chicken and walnuts, I used a few tablespoons of the sticky stuff in a garlicky barbecue sauce and it was the best barbecue ever.

Not really. First of all, you drink juice for health reasons. Vitamins, frutose over corn syrup and the like. Carbonating beverages generally aren't considered good for you, so it's odd that the two would be mixed.  Besides the carbonation, and the aluminum can (which has been proved can lead to Alzheimer's) there's a lot of deceptive marketing going on. The can claims that Switch is 100% juice, but it's not actually 100% Orange and Tangerine juice. In fact, the drink is mostly apple and grape juice. You can taste this instantly, along with the metallic tang of being in a can. This is done because both of those juices are quite cheap in comparison to orange and tangerine. So really, you're getting more a a carbonated fruit punch then an orange tangerine drink.  You're also gettinbg \"Natural flavours and colours\" which kind of kills the whole \"100% juice\" claim.  With a taste that is both metallic and not really resembling the flavours it claims, I can't really recommend this product, You can generally buy boxed 100% juice for less, which contains more flavour, no aluminum and no carbonation.", "output": "No point in having carbonated juice", "category": "Summarization 1216.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a review from Amazon's food products.

It doesn't have a bad taste, but it is different than a regular orange flavored soda. It is definitely not as sweet (which isn't a bad thing for me as I find the orange sodas way too sweet) and left a tiny bit of an odd aftertaste. It is a healthier alternative to regular sodas as there is no high fructose corn syrup, but it was still just as caloric. It is juice rather than artificial syrups, but the first juices listed in the ingredients are the overly sweet apple and grape constitutes, not orange and tangerine, to make the drink taste sweeter I suppose. Honestly, considering the price of this product and the lukewarm impression it left on me, I would rather just pour my own juice blend and add soda water or sparkling water to it myself. Most juices seem to be vitamin C fortified themselves, so unless you are just looking to replace the artificial sodas with something less damaging, I can't see a big benefit to this product.", "output": "Ho-Hum, It's OK.", "category": "Summarization 1216.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a review from Amazon's food products.

There's not all that much root per teabag though, and since I like strong coffee I only use 6 oz of water per bag and steep it covered for 15 mins. Then with some cream and sugar it's quite good.  As for the liver tonic claim, well dandelion stimulates bile flow and supposedly helps clear out some stuff gunking up the liver. I don't know about that yet, but so far I haven't noticed any ill effects from drinking this. I feel fine, if not outright good after drinking a cup, but that's as far as I can confirm the effects.
