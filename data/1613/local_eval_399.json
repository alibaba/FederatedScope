A few days after discovering the shimmy in the steering wheel, the car owner lent his automobile to his next-door neighbor. When the neighbor picked up the car, the car owner forgot to tell him about the shimmy. The neighbor was driving the car at a reasonable rate of speed within the posted speed limit when the car began to swerve across the road. The neighbor turned the steering wheel in an attempt to stay on the road. The steering failed, however, and the car veered off the road and onto the sidewalk. The car struck a pedestrian who was injured in the collision. If the pedestrian initiates suit against the owner of the car, the pedestrian will most likely\n(A)prevail, because the car owner knew the steering was faulty and failed to tell his neighbor who borrowed the car.  (B)prevail, because the car owner is strictly liable under the circumstances.  (C)not prevail, because the faulty steering was the cause-in-fact of the pedestrian's harm.  (D)not prevail, because the car owner was a gratuitous lender. ", "output": "A", "category": "Question Answering 1357.json"}, {"instruction": "You are given a question on professional law.

One afternoon, the husband drank a fifth of bourbon and was drunk when his wife returned home from work. When the wife saw her husband's condition, she got very angry because they had planned to go out to dinner and celebrate their wedding anniversary. While the husband was passed out on the living room couch, the wife decided to fix herself a martini. After drinking two martinis, the wife became extremely inebriated. A short while later, the wife began preparing a third martini and tried to slice a lemon for the drink. As she did so, the knife slipped, and she cut her hand severely. With blood gushing from the wound, the wife called her husband to help her. He awoke momentarily, stood up, but fell back on the couch and passed out. He failed to render any assistance, and the wife bled to death. If the husband is subsequently charged with manslaughter, he will be found\n(A)guilty, because he owed his wife a duty to assist her.  (B)guilty, because criminal negligent conduct cannot be negated by voluntary intoxication.  (C)not guilty, because the wife caused her own injury.  (D)not guilty, because he was physically unable to assist her. ", "output": "D", "category": "Question Answering 1357.json"}]
