Unfortunately, I was completely wrong. Tess depressed and frustrated me extremely throughout the book. She cowarded down and let people run over her. The only thing that was good was the little surprises inserted every now and then.

Not to mention you could probably read half of each chapter and still keep up with the plot.Nonetheless, the themes are so strong it is no wonder The Scarlett Letter has been deemed a classic. The story tackles the issues of how one deals with his/her sins, and how honesty, for some, comes at the price of great shame.The novel does take patience, but it moves along at a very neat pace. Had the novel been written with more scenes, and less exposition, it could have been even more gripping.I read the Reader's Digest edition, which comes with about 12 lovely illustrations, which capture the essence and the mood of the novel. So that was nice eye candy.Look out for the last three chapters - talk about a fall-to-the floor, clutching-at-the-heart climax; it's all here!

The heroine, and I use that term lightly, plays at being a spinster and dressing as a drab. For some reason, delights in hiding her beauty. In the ballroom scene, she behaves in such a manner that loses me entirely - as well as any interest that she should end up with the Duke in the end. He deserved better! The dukes only friend betrays him. He is a miserable man who society now scornes when he did nothing wrong in the first place! He should have packed his bags and came to america.

She'll get everything ready (showing me everything she has accomplished along the way) and then we'll watch her special parade. A wonderfully cute game that I highly recommend.She can mostly do the entire game on her own. I have it installed on a laptop so she is actually using the inset mouse and can still do the game. The only one she has a tough time with is the Polar Bear catching fish game. It's tricky to move your finger on the mouse pad and click at the same time to catch the fish. It would be much easier using a regular mouse. \n Polarity: Negative", "output": "False", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1121.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a review text from amazon and its polarity (either positive or negative).

So,do not even try to read this book if you have no time. \n Polarity: Negative", "output": "True", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1121.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a review text from amazon and its polarity (either positive or negative).

As much as Anita O'Day used to do whith drums, Sheila Jordan has the unique ability to express herself in a clear, witty and unique way, scatting or singin words, talking and exchanging suggestions with the acoustic bass player. This is the second, according to my knowledge, and probably one of the very best of her duo recordings. A must for jazz fans and listeners keen to jazz singers with an instrumental attitude. \n Polarity: Negative", "output": "False", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1121.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a review text from amazon and its polarity (either positive or negative).

The difficulties that many young women face as they mature into fully functioning sexual adults - as mitigated by their upbringings as well as the varied expectations of society and their partners - are nicely illustrated through a series of real life case studies. The author, Dr. Bardon, was a teaching and research member of the faculty of the University of Minnesota from the early 1960s through the late 1990s. Some of the book will undoubtedly be dated, but much of it is just as relevant -...- today as when it was written in the mid 1970s.

The book was originally written in 1968, then revised in 1976 and 1985. During the process of revision, Khouri, appearantly, did not make many changes in the original text, a fact that leaves much of the book outdated. Khouri's account takes a strong anti Israeli and pro Arab stance. For example, he chooses to downplay the Palestinian terrorist attacks during the 1970s and mentions such attacks as the attack on the Israeli athletes in Munich and the attack of the Marine base in Beirut with no detail. His study is based very closely on UN records and ignores the reality of the Middle East. \n Polarity: Positive", "output": "False", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1121.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a review text from amazon and its polarity (either positive or negative).

Bad! It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. The story didn't make a lick of sense. You got these bad guys who kidnap a random woman whose husband turns out to be Rambo. The marine chases after these guys, killing them one by one. You'd think they'd just give him back his wife. She means nothing to them. Give her back and they can go on with their criminal business. But no. They hold on to her.The marine runs/jumps in slow motion away from explosions at least 4 times in this movie.

However, the remaining tracks offer enjoyable examples of the Hollies vocal and musical expertise.In addition to the aforementioned AIR, I like the airy mystique of PICK UP THE PIECES, the harmonic rock of IT'S A SHAME IT'S A GAME, TRANSATLANTIC WESTBOUND JET, and DON'T LET ME DOWN.

Both protagonist and narrator, the cat often acts as a Greek chorus who comments, often sardonically, on the actions of the humans around him. Set in pre-World War II Algeria, with a lengthy detour to Paris, the beautifully illustrated narrative depicts a richly diverse world in which individuals seek to preserve their traditions while constantly interacting with people of other cultural, social and religious backgrounds. In this multilayered environment, the presence of an intelligent talking cat does not seem entirely out of place. \n Polarity: Negative", "output": "False", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1121.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a review text from amazon and its polarity (either positive or negative).

Also the frequent use of sarcasm and satire is not in anyway humorous and portrays the author as \"god's gift to English teaching\".

The motor noise is recorded in with your audio, so you hear a loud hummmm in the background. It was too loud for me to live with.

For example, in chapter 11 (Tariffs), the author argues that imposing a $5 tariff on an import (sweaters from England) ends up costing the US. Never once does he add the $5 duty received into the equation. How can someone argue against an import tax without analyzing what happens to the revenues from that tax? When the next chapter stated that Exports must equal Imports, I quit reading.In short, I couldn't agree more with the author that all too often the analysis of costs/benefits focus is too narrow. Yet, in trying to expanding the analysis beyond the 'too narrow', the author's analysis in fact is often too narrow. \n Polarity: Negative", "output": "True", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1121.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a review text from amazon and its polarity (either positive or negative).

I thought I'd replace her [poorly made] and dangerous ones with these, due to what I thought of as the quality name brand Anchor Hocking. She already got a different set of glasses, so I kept them for myself. One was broken in the box when I opened them up. I thought no big deal. I started using them, and within a month, of the 16 total, I am down to only one large one and four small ones. I also have 2 less butterfly stitches and 6 less bandaids in my cabinet. My daughter informed me that these were the EXACT glasses she experienced the same problems with.

This book is more like the cliff notes to a book about men's fashion, tradition, style, etc. The other half of the book is relatively useless - unless, of course, you're a millionaire & world traveller.

Still, there are some very imporatnt basice male fashion rules established by history and tradition, discussed in this book, which one wishes were adhered to more regularly. The first half of the book is serviceable, but not authoritative. Flusser comes off somewhat foppish and the picture of him on the dustjacket would lead me to question his taste in, if nothing else, haircuts!

The book does recognize that it is really when the MIDI-instruments are connected to a computer that MIDI takes on its real power, but only 10% of the book talks about MIDI and computers. The chapter on computer tells you about the choice between PC, MAC, Atrari and Commodore, and explains in length what a CD-rom is, and why we need it (not all programs fit on a floppy disk...) Sequencer program are mentioned, but barely so.The book does a fair job in explaining the MIDI standard and how it works, but it does not help me at all when I want to get started in connecting the components to my PC.

Because my local hardware store carries them, and they are readily available elsewhere, and I have opted for form over function. Every single Umbra rod I have used fails drastically. They simply cannot bear any weight. Or, to put it differently, they cannot exert enough force against the surfaces they extend out to for them to bear any load. Worse, the springs that are the key element in sustaining the tension tend to fail. When those springs fail, anything you have suspended by the rod will come down.

The last story needed a good editor to clean it up, especially the beginning, and make it more coherent. IMO, this book is not worth buying and inferior to its predecessors. \n Polarity: Positive", "output": "False", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1121.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a review text from amazon and its polarity (either positive or negative).

Since it was the 1998 RITA award as best regency, and beat \"Lord Heartless\" for that win, I was expecting a terrific novel. Instead, the book drags and the characters act in such an unrealistic ways. As far as the Duke goes, our hero, he has no family or friends. The heroine, and I use that term lightly, plays at being a spinster and dressing as a drab. For some reason, delights in hiding her beauty. In the ballroom scene, she behaves in such a manner that loses me entirely - as well as any interest that she should end up with the Duke in the end. He deserved better! The dukes only friend betrays him. He is a miserable man who society now scornes when he did nothing wrong in the first place! He should have packed his bags and came to america. I usually like Emma Jensen's books. There was nothing romantic about the book. Only a creepy feeling at the way society ended up treating the Duke. \n Polarity: Negative", "output": "True", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1121.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a review text from amazon and its polarity (either positive or negative).

Disappointed with how they explained the absence of his true love, Mikeala, and why they broke up. For him to have a model as a girlfriend seemed a bit of a reach. She lacked the toughness that spurred the character of Sam (Shai) to do great things. This movie is on a scale of 1-10 about a 4 for story line and a 7 for action.
