Although I don't have many followers on here,  I'm hoping the couple of them that do see this will visit and tell their followers about it and so on and so on. This small place on Burford Highway can be very easily missed; i mean I missed it trying to get there and had to drive back again to spot it lol, anyway came here with my friend Ravi on Monday night for dinner, we can be very indecisive about our food but the server was super patient with us and luckily spoke Spanish and English like me also, made it much easier for me to explain the food to Ravi. We chose a few things on the menu to try out: empanadas de carne which were amazing,  also tamales or chuchitos as they call them which I have never liked from any country or my own family for that matter and my mind wasn't changed this time either, but that doesn't mean they are not good because Ravi liked them; its just my  personal taste bud. We also got pechuga a la plancha con arroz y frijoles negros which was off the chain,  and lastly a quesadilla with chorizo which was also delicious. All in all we were very satisfied with our dinner that night and would love to come back to try their breakfast in the morning and any other plates they have. So I highly recommend it, please give it a shot, and tell more people about them cause small places like these deserve more attention than the bigger ones everyone already knows.", "output": "positive", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1374.json"}, {"instruction": "You are provided with a user review of a restaurant.

I found This place and because of the many positive reviews I gave it a chance. I called 20 minutes before to see if they accepted walk ins and was told by the gentleman who answered the phones they did so I took the drive to the salon. Upon entering it was very dark, maybe because they call themselves a spa it was part of the ambiance. It was not very clean and many of the stations seemed to be crowded with junk. I wanted just a gel polish change but they would only let me do it with a manicure. I had to take it upon myself to find the board that had the gel polish nail colors. And most of them seemed old, definitely not a color selection thats impressing. The guy doing my nails seemed to be in a rush and was not paying attention to what he was doing. My nails were not filed straight and when I pointed it out he got annoyed. Then when buffing my nailed he cut the skin on my fingers. Dont even get me started on my cuticles that are worse now than when he started. I will not be back, and maybe it was just my experience but it was not work the $30 they charge for a crappy 'manicure'. Look at the other options in the area.", "output": "negative", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1374.json"}, {"instruction": "You are provided with a user review of a restaurant.

However, the convenience of making an appointment online, current promotions, and location gave me the push to visit them for the first time. I am very pleased with my experience and the level of service. They reported that the brakes were at 6-70% but, as I already suspected, it needed a full strut/shock job at 4 corners. The avg for such is $175-250 a corner, and with all the promotions from them and the manufacturer, I ended up with labor, tax, etc at about $182 a corner, so it felt like a great deal. They were quick and communicated well. Lastly, they forgot the LOF, and were apologetic, but not a problem, we had some time before it was needed. However, thanks to Chris who followed up with a call and a generous offer to LOF for free. Also he mailed some 10% coupons. I'll be back, and appreciate the customer service, which really defines the experience. Let's face it, anyone can do an LOF. It is the service that makes me return. Thanks!", "output": "positive", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1374.json"}, {"instruction": "You are provided with a user review of a restaurant.

Waited about 45 minutes on a Saturday night but went on a Tuesday and got right in.Once seated they give you free chips with an assortment of salsa which is always a plus!The margarita's are pretty good; I prefer their traditional one myself. I also love that they have corona light on draft.Even if it's busy, service always seems to be good. However, once I sat at the bar and it took about 10minutes to be greeted.Everytime I come here I order the chicken tacos, a little dry but still very good.I recommend this place for a date night or night out with friends!", "output": "positive", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1374.json"}, {"instruction": "You are provided with a user review of a restaurant.

I just moved back to the area and need a new stylist. I came in with *orange* hair, trying to lift from years of boxed black (I know, I know) after having been told by more than one stylist that I had to settle. My experience with Michael confirmed that sometimes other stylists dont have the interest or investment in their craft to actually be the creative artist that they signed up to be. Michael gave my hair the time and attention it has desperately needed for a long time, with a set of amazingly bright, light highlights, the kind my other stylists could not deliver. I also requested a challenging cut, going from kind of long blah to an 'a line' bob which is also amazing. I am *really* happy with the outstanding, attentive service that I received and I am happy to have a stylist whose work I really love!", "output": "positive", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1374.json"}, {"instruction": "You are provided with a user review of a restaurant.

We asked if they could seat 7, not feeling too optimistic but were told it wouldn't be a problem, they would just put us in the back (this place is way bigger than it looks from the outside). We retrieved our friends from outside and headed straight back. The service was a little disorganized, but I'm not expecting perfection when we spring a bunch of people on them at the last minute at a busy time. Overall, I think we were helped by 4 different people and they were all pretty great, happily giving us their opinions.The food came out with surprisingly little wait and it was so dang good. Everyone at the table was pleased. The potatoes au gratin seemed to be a particular hit. I will definitely be back to try their sweet crepes since everyone at the table went with savory this time around. I'm excited to have a new restaurant in the area that I can depend on.", "output": "positive", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1374.json"}, {"instruction": "You are provided with a user review of a restaurant.

Indoor/outdoor so I imagine it can get hot - but the food was really good, drinks were reasonably priced. They have a lake view and chairs set up outside to enjoy a beautiful, Florida sunset and its a nice change of pace from Vanberrys across the street that is always so busy. Its more of a 'beach' style place - casual dining.

We called the order in at 12pm, so we could have it ready for pick up at 6pm. We arrived at 6pm and the employees told us the order wasn't ready. Then they said that they were busy and had a lot of large orders. I have to say my Family has been in the restaurant business for 40 years and if we ever treated customers like this, we would have never survived. FYI, THE REASON WE ORDERED THE FOOD SO EARLY IN THE DAY, WAS SO WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO WAIT WHEN ALL THE ORDERS WERE COMING IN FOR THE DINNER RUSH. Very bad customer service.
