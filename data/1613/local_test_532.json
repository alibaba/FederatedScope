She has official entered Kindergarten! Being in school isn\u2019t new to her though. She has been in Pre-K for a year so she is use to getting up, putting on a uniform and even being around the big kids. She was very excited to start Kindergarten. i however am not ready for her to be so ready. She went to bed early at 7PM and the lights went off! I woke her up to our traditional \u201cWake Up Song\u201d. I\u2019ve been singer her this song since she was a baby, this stirs up the emotions knowing she is now a \"big kid\" Sometimes she sings along\u2026sometimes she pulls the covers over her head. . I also got up early to cook breakfast. Our daily breakfast consists of egg whites, turkey bacon and fruit. Every once in a while I will let her eat her favorite cereal but we keep it healthy! She only ate a little bit. I recon she was nervous. So we grabbed her sparkly book bag, lunch box that looks like a purse and her huge shopping bag of school supplies and headed to school. I am very blessed that her school is only 5 minutes from our home. We got there in no time and I walked her inside. The teachers had the kids sectioned off in the cafeteria by grade. I went to give her a kiss before she sat down and she covered her face!!! Later she told me that other kids would make fun of her. BUT ITS THE FIRST DAY OF KINDERGARTEN!!! Looks like my baby girl is already grown!!!", "category": "Story Composition 1477.json"}, {"instruction": "Read the given summary of events, and write a longer story which covers everything described in the summary.

It includes how I felt about receiving my two year token and details about the experience.", "output": "I recently received my token for being two years of being clean and sober at my local Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, as well as my Narcotics Anonymous meeting. It was a very calm and peaceful morning filled with a lot of excitement and pride. I walked into the meeting feeling a little nervous, but once the leader of the meeting began to speak, my nerves settled and I felt more comfortable and accomplished. The leader made a brief statement about how far I had come in my recovery / journey, how proud she was of me, and how I had touched and affected her life. Once she finished making her speech, she introduced me, as well as presented me with my two year token and a very beautiful cake. Afterwards, my sponsor surprised me by making an appearance. Initially, she had told me that she would be unable to attend, which made me very disappointed because she was and is such an important part of my sobriety and recovery. My sponsor came to the front of the room and made a speech about me and my recovery, which made me cry because it was very emotional. After this, everyone in the room had cake and many of them came up to me individually to congratulate me and praise my success in recovery. Many of the participants of the meeting brought me little gifts and keepsakes, which made me feel very special. One of the gifts I received was a little box that had my sobriety / clean date engraved on it, as well as a very special quote that I find inspiration in. \"For where your treasure is there your heart will be also\". My sponsor gave me a journal that had an inscription inside the front cover from her along with my sobriety / clean date. This was a very memorable event because I have worked very hard to overcome a great deal of vices in my life, including addiction and the underlying conditions and issues that have had an impact on my addiction. To be able to stand up in front of a room filled with my peers and honestly say that I have been clean and sober for two years was such a memorable and special experience and event.", "category": "Story Composition 1477.json"}]
