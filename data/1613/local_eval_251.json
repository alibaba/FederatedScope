Shields cannot get financing on his own, but with their names attached, there would be no problem.  Pebbel asks the three to allow him to get Shields on the phone before they give their final answer. As they await Shields' call, Pebbel assures the three that he understands why they refused to speak to Shields.  The backstory of their involvement with Shields then unfolds in a series of flashbacks. Shields is the son of a notorious former studio head who had been dumped by the industry. The elder Shields was so unpopular that his son had to hire \"extras\" to attend his funeral.  Despite the industry's ill feelings toward him because of his father, the younger Shields is determined to make it in Hollywood by any means necessary. Shields partners with aspiring director Amiel, whom he meets at his father's funeral. Shields intentionally loses money he does not have in a poker game to film executive Pebbel, so he can talk Pebbel into letting him work off the debt as a line producer. Shields and Amiel learn their respective trades making B movies for Pebbel. When one of their films becomes a hit, Amiel decides they are ready to take on a more significant project he has been nursing along, and Shields pitches it to the studio. Shields gets a $1 million budget to produce the film, but betrays Amiel by allowing someone with an established reputation to be chosen as director.  The film's success allows Shields to start his own studio, and Pebbel comes to work for him there.
