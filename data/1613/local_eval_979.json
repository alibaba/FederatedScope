I just imagined that all the drip coffee makers would have a timer. If I have to be there to start it I might as well do French press right? I know that\u2019s my fault to a degree. But the next problem is the pot and the lid. What kind of certifiable lunatic would make the pot so it won\u2019t fit if the lid is on? So when you are done brewing I guess you have to immediately discard the rinds or just let it drip everywhere. It would also be nice if I could fit my hand in the pot to clean it.
