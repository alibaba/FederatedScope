now get out!\"\n\nshe left the room and soon after a large man entered and informed me that they were moving me to another room. once there i was instructed to strip down, dawn a hospital gown,  have my blood drawn and give a urine sample. at this point i think i legitimately had shock. i was shaking uncontrollably despite having several blankets. i was confused and scared. after a few hours of waiting on lab results, they then transported me via ambulance to where i would stay for the next 3 nights.\n\nfor those of you who don't know (like me before sunday), if hospital personnel believe you are a suicide risk or a danger to others, they can legally place you under official watch/care for 24 hours. after that period, you can request to be released. if that request is granted, you are released right away, however if the request is denied, they can legally detain you for another 48 hours without your consent.\n\nit gets worse.\n\nafter arriving, i'm still in shock. they lead me into a room, have me fill out some paperwork and then move me to the living quarters. there i learned you had to share a room with another patient. my roommate, whom we will call david, was an interesting fellow. he introduced himself and said he would answer any questions i had and that he would look out for me. he then warned me not to wake him up or come near his bed when he slept. he told me he was schizophrenic and was doing time here before going to court over murder charges. i didn't sleep well that night.\n\ni woke up twice to shouting during the night. i later found out that both times were because of another man staying there. a man who called himself \"chainsaw\". now chainsaw was the first person in my life i ever met that i genuinely felt was not all there. chainsaw would tell you all about how the kennedys where drunk assholes. he would tell you war stories and tear up doing so. and then seconds later call one of the patients a filthy c*** because she told him to get away from her.  my first night there, he snuck into a woman's room, rifled through her underwear and then tried sleeping on her bed before the techs (fancy word for orderlies) removed him. that woman was suppose to stay till the end of the week, however she was released the day after the incident.\n\nunderstand you spent every moment in close proximity to other patients. you can't close your doors, and you can't be alone. you must participate in group therapy 3-4 times a day. i have more stories, but that should set the tone for my stay. understand that the doctors wouldn't listen, no matter how hard i tried to explain to them that i did not belong there. in fact, they tried to get me to stay for 7 days. thankfully, by law, they had to release me after 72 hours. so, after learning this fact, i entered survival mode. i was going to be the healthiest god damn patient they ever had. i was friendly. i was compliant. i told them i was happy and content. when they asked me to draw pictures with markers and colored pencils, i drew the happiest fucking bushes you've ever seen. i gave them zero reason to keep me around. i did my time and got out.\n\nthe sad thing is that there were a lot of people there because it was honestly a better place for them. victims of abuse, drug abusers, and those who attempted suicide. i did see some wonderful people in there and they at least got a break from their personal hell and had someone watching out for them for a few days. the techs were compassionate and did infinitely more for me than the doctors ever did. they even bent the rules a couple times for me, and really saved my sanity. even with that though, it's a shame that my fellow patients did not get better care from the system they were forced to be a part of.\n\ni'm now seeing, significantly more qualified, help. i'm also getting trauma therapy after this whole ordeal. i'll be on disability for the next 6 weeks at the recommendation of my new doctors. if you learn one thing today, it's don't loose your shit in the hospital.\n\noh, by the way, the food was god awful. first thing i did when i got out was chow down on a greasy bacon cheeseburger. best god damn burger of my life.", "output": "TIFU by getting myself sent to a psych ward", "category": "Title Generation 1137.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text.
