The foal is rescued by widower and former racehorse trainer Nolan Walsh Bruce Greenwood, and is taken to his farm where his daughter, Channing Hayden Panettiere names him Stripes. He meets a Shetland pony named Tucker Dustin Hoffman; a goat, Franny Whoopi Goldberg; and a rooster, Reggie Jeff Foxworthy. Stripes soon becomes convinced that he is destined for the nearby racetrack, the Kentucky Open, not realizing that he is a zebra and is not qualified to race. Two foals named Trentons Pride and Ruffshodd decide to race Stripes until they are stopped by Prides father, Kentucky Open champion Sir Trenton Fred Dalton Thompson. Three years later, after racing the mailman, an adult Stripes Frankie Muniz meets an Arabian filly named Sandy Mandy Moore and develops a crush on her after losing to the mailman in their usual race. While talking to Sandy, he is approached by Pride Joshua Jackson and Ruffshodd Michael Rosenbaum, Stripes tormentors since childhood. Pride challenges Stripes to a racing match on a Blue Moon night; he accepts, but loses the race. The following day, Tucker, having secretly watched Stripes, approaches him and suggests that he gets proper training first. Stripes, in need of a rider, chooses Chan and convinces a new farm animal, a pelican named Goose Joe Pantoliano, to sabotage Chans motorcycle and Old Blue, Nolans old pickup truck, so that Chan can ride him to her workplace at the Kentucky Open. The plan works, and Chan, with Nolans reluctant approval, rides Stripes to the Kentucky Open. There, Chan is antagonized by her boss, Clara Dalrymple Wendie Malick, for bringing Stripes to the racetrack, while Stripes meets a pair of horsefly brothers, Buzz and Scuzz Steve Harvey and David Spade. As night approaches, Chan, remembering her first ride on horseback with her mother Carolyn, completes a lap around the track with Stripes. They are approached by Woodzie M. Emmet Walsh, a racetrack gambler and old friend of the family, who encourages Chan to sign her and Stripes up for a tryout race tomorrow. She does, despite Nolans disapproval stemming from his wife Carolyns death in a racing accident six years ago, which discouraged him to continue training horses after that, but Stripes has a major meltdown after being easily scared by the horsegate like all the other horses the next morning at the tryouts. Once he calms down, he begins running, but then gets hit in the face by flying dirt while racing, causing Chan to fall off. Though she is uninjured, Nolan chastises her. Then, Dalrymple sarcastically signs Stripes up to compete in the Kentucky Open competition. Meanwhile, Stripes realizes he is a zebra after being told off by Sir Trenton, which severely discourages him. Despite Chans pleas, Nolan refuses to let her race Stripes. Realizing this, the farm animals lure Nolan into the farm to show him a table holding his past accomplishments and he changes his mind. Meanwhile, due to Stripes misbehavior during training, Franny reveals to Stripes that Tucker helped Nolan train the racehorse champions including Sir Trenton without getting any thanks, which encourages him to begin training. Refusing to allow Stripes to race, Sir Trenton and several thoroughbreds ambush Stripes and Sandy at a creek as they are talking and making up for their previous argument one night, kidnapping Sandy and threatening to hurt her if he races. The next day, after rescuing Stripes, Tucker, Franny, and Goose agree to rescue Sandy. They do it with a little help from Buzz and Scuzz and get back in time for Stripes to go to the race. Before the race, Nolan bets Dalrymple that if he wins then he gets Sandy, and if he loses then he will come back to work for her. During the race, Ruffshodd tries to stop Stripes from winning until Scuzz deliberately gets him disqualified. Later, Stripes begins to wear out until he finally remembers something Tucker taught him, which boosts up his confidence, and he wins the race and finally earns respect from the other racehorses, including Pride. In the end, they all pose together in a group photo which is later shown with the other previous Walsh wins.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

In consoling her, Nick ends up back at the Bells house, where he and Mary both cheat on their respective spouses by having sex. Several days later, Mary informs Nick that she immediately told Russell about the affair, and that the confession has actually improved their marriage. Fearing retaliation, Nick confronts Russell at work, and is confused and surprised by Russells eventempered response to the situation. Meanwhile, Nicks wife, Connie Cate Blanchett, seems to become more and more intrigued by Russell, and Nick becomes increasingly paranoid that Russell will eventually seek revenge by having sex with her. While out of town for his fatherinlaws funeral, Nick cant bring himself to lie when a grieving Connie challenges him to say that he has never cheated on her. As their flight home approaches New York, Connie tells Nick that she has indeed slept with Russell. The plane then makes an odd turn, and Nick assumes that Russell is harassing him, or possibly going insane, by purposely directing the plane into a dangerous storm.

That afternoon he falls asleep in his chair and his teaching career is related in flashback. When 25yearold Charles Edward Chipping first arrives as a Latin teacher in 1870, he becomes a target of practical jokes on his first day. He reacts by imposing strict discipline in his classroom, making him disliked but respected. Twenty years pass and he becomes the senior master. He is disappointed in not receiving an appointment as a housemaster within the school for the following year. However, the new German teacher, Max Staefel Paul Henreid, saves him from despair by inviting him to share a walking holiday to his native Austria. While mountainclimbing, Chipping encounters Kathy Ellis Greer Garson, a feisty English suffragette who is on a cycling holiday with a friend. They meet again in Vienna where she persuades him to dance to the Blue Danube Waltz. This piece of music is used as a leitmotif, symbolizing Chippings love for her. Staefel remarks that the Danube does not appear blue, but Chipping remarks it only appears so to those who are in love. On another part of the same boat, as Kathy looks at the river, she tells her friend that it is blue. Even though Kathy is considerably younger and livelier than Chipping, she loves and marries him. They return to England, where Kathy takes up residence at the school, charming everyone with her warmth. During their tragically short marriage she dies in childbirth, along with their baby, she brings Chips out of his shell and shows him how to be a better teacher. He acquires a flair for Latin puns. As the years pass, Chips becomes a muchloved school institution, developing a rapport with generations of pupils; he teaches the sons and grandsons of many of his earlier pupils. In 1909, when he is pressured to retire by a more modern headmaster, the boys and the board of governors of the school take his side of the argument and tell him he can stay until he is 100, and is free to pronounce Cicero as SISerro, and not as KEEkirro. Chips finally retires in 1914 at the age of 69, but is summoned back to serve as interim headmaster because of the shortage of teachers resulting from the First World War. He remembers Kathy had predicted he would become headmaster one day. During a bombing attack by a German zeppelin, Chips insists that the boys keep on translating their Latin  choosing the story of Julius Caesars battles against Germanic tribes, which describes the latters belligerent nature, much to the amusement of his pupils. As the Great War drags on, Chips reads aloud into the schools Roll of Honour every Sunday the names of the many former boys and teachers who have died in the war. Upon discovering that Max Staefel has died fighting on the German side, Chips reads out his name in chapel, too. He retires permanently in 1918, but continues living nearby. He is on his deathbed in 1933 when he overhears his colleagues talking about him. He responds, I thought you said it was a pity, a pity I never had any children. But youre wrong. I have!

He is diplomatic on the surface, preaching rapport to gang members to encourage them to offer help when it is truly needed and recognizes that every action cops take is scrutinized by the very people they are trying to help.

He retires immediately and sets out to find his first love, Sonia Schworz, with whom he shared an attic on a Lithuanian farm while hiding from the Nazis for a large part of World War Two. Their reunion takes place in Israel, where Sonia settled after the war. Although the couple has not seen each other for sixty years, it turns out that in the meantime they have been following similar life paths, not unlike twins separated at birth. Both have achieved enviable prosperity and enjoy the company of much younger bedfellows. To get these youngsters out of the way, Sonia unceremoniously dumps her lover Chaim, while Izias pregnant wife Olga is quickly persuaded to marry Sonias grandson Yossi. Yossi bears an uncanny resemblance to the Lithuanian farmer Juozas, who hid Sonia and Izia as children in 1941, and won over Sonias heart in 1944 in an unequal competition with the inexperienced Izia. Although Juozas is killed by Lithuanian Nazi sympathizers, Izia does not forgive Sonia for what he sees as betrayal, and refuses to follow her to Palestine when Lithuania is liberated. The irony of it all, commonly known as Jewish happiness, lies in the patterns that keep repeating themselves sixty years after: Izia loses his woman Olga this time to a Juozas lookalike again and fails to keep Sonia too she suddenly dies in a terrorist explosion at Yossis and Olgas wedding. Apparently, Sonias and Izias union was never meant to last, either at the beginning or at the end of their lives. On his deathbed, pondering on the lost opportunities, Izia reiterates Gods commandment to multiply and replenish the earth in the form of an impassionate plea to Olga and Yossi to waste no time in going forth and procreating, presumably to contribute to the survival of the Jewish people, constantly threatened by extermination.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

Ive never run from anybody before. Besides, he says, Miller and his gang will hunt him down anyway. Amy gives Kane an ultimatum: She is leaving on the noon train, with or without him. While waiting at the hotel for the train, she meets Helen Ramirez Katy Jurado, who was once Millers lover, and then Kanes, and is leaving as well. Amy understands why Helen is fleeing, but the reverse is not true: Helen tells Amy that if Kane were her man, she would not abandon him in his hour of need. Kanes efforts to round up a posse at the tavern, and then the church, are met with fear and hostility. Some townspeople, worried that a gunfight would damage the towns reputation, urge Kane to avoid the confrontation entirely. Others are Millers friends, and resent that Kane cleaned up the town in the first place. Kanes young deputy Harvey Pell Lloyd Bridges, who is bitter that Kane did not recommend him as his successor, says he will stand with Kane only if Kane goes to the city fathers and puts the word in for him. Kane rejects the quid pro quo, and Pell turns in his badge. Kane visits a series of old friends and allies, but none can or will help: His predecessor, Marshal Howe Lon Chaney Jr. is old and arthritic; Judge Percy Mettrick Otto Kruger, who sentenced Miller, flees on horseback, and urges Kane to do the same; townsman Herb Baker James Millican agrees to be deputized, but backs out when he realizes he is the only volunteer; Sam Fuller Harry Morgan hides in his house, sending his wife Eve McVeagh to the door to tell Kane he isnt home. Kane writes out his will as the clock in his office ticks toward high noon. At the stables, Pell saddles a horse and tries to persuade Kane to mount it and leave town. Their conversation becomes an argument, and then a fist fight. Kane finally knocks his former deputy senseless, then goes into the street to face Miller and his gang alone. The outlaws approach and the gunfight begins. Kane guns down Ben Miller and Colby, but is wounded in the process. As the train is about to leave the station, Amy hears the gunfire, leaps off, and runs back to town. Choosing her husbands life over her religious beliefs, she picks up Ben Millers gun and shoots Pierce from behind, leaving only Frank Miller, who grabs Amy as a shield to force Kane into the open. Amy claws Millers face and he pushes her to the ground, giving Kane a clear shot, and he shoots Miller dead. Kane helps his bride to her feet and they embrace.

Klute asks Cable for an additional 500 to buy the black book of clients of Bree, telling Cable he is certain it will reveal the identity of the abusive client.

One day, Ricko Simon Lyndon, a surfer popular among the local youths, returns from an elevenmonth trip. Jareds mother Diane Linda Cropper attempts to tell Jared that she has been diagnosed with breast cancer, though Jared insists on talking to her later as he is busy arranging a welcome home party for Ricko at the local surf club. Rachels father, a photographer who takes provocative images of women, forbids her from attending the party, though he allows her older brother Toby Heath Ledger to attend. While driving to the party, Toby sees Tracy Bojana Novakovic, Cherie Rebecca Smart and two other girls, and gives them a ride. Jared flirts with Tracy at the party and subsequently gets into a fight with Toby. Ricko comes to Jareds defence, though Jared breaks up the fight after Ricko has hit Toby several times. Tracy comes to comfort Toby and Jared leaves the party to head to the beach alone. Jared sees Toby having consensual sex with Tracy on the beach. He then witnesses three of his male friends interrupting the couple and raping Tracy. Tracy calls out for help, though Jared, who is visibly disturbed by what he is witnessing, does not intervene. Toby and the other three boys, who never noticed Jared was watching, flee the area. Jared also runs away, leaving Tracy alone and distressed. Later that night Rachel, who has snuck out of home to attend the party, finds Tracys beaten corpse on the beach. Jared initially tells the police nothing of what he saw. He is torn between the need to tell the truth and the desire to protect his friends; his anger leads to the breakdown of his relationships with both Rachel and Diane. Despite Jareds silence, police arrest Toby and the three other boys within a few days.

Ricko confesses to Jared that he killed Tracy, but claims it was an accident \u2013 that she hit her head on a rock when he attempted to have sex with her. He has already told police that he was with Jared all night and asks Jared to confirm his alibi in the name of mateship. Diane, who still has not been able to tell Jared that she has cancer due to his behaviour, goes in to have surgery. Jared tells the police that he was with Ricko; when he tries to suggest Tracys death may have been an accident, the police show him the photos of Tracys battered body. Jared aggressively confronts Ricko at the beach and Ricko confesses that Tracys death was not an accident. He had found her walking on the beach after the rape and she asked him to take her home. He agreed, but wanted to have sex with her first. She tried to fight him off and bit him in the process, which enraged him enough to beat her to death. As Ricko finishes his confession, the police arrive and he realises that Jared has turned him in. He attempts to escape but the police give chase and corner him on a cliff. Rather than go to jail, and ignoring Jareds screams of protest, he jumps to his death. In the weeks that follow, Jareds life collapses. Despite learning of Dianes illness, he moves out of her house, choosing instead to be homeless.

Michael encounters Bill Plummer. Plummer and Duke are rival saloon keepers and partners in a mining company, but due to a dispute between them, the mine is closed, leaving many of the townspeople destitute. Plummer has hired the Kansas City Kid, a gunslinger, to kill Duke. When Bill finds out that Duke knows about his plan, he gives Michael a lift into town and as Plummer had hoped, Duke mistakes Michael for the Kid. Dukes henchman, Treason, takes a shot at Michael, narrowly missing a young girl. Furious, parsons daughter and schoolmarm Drusilla Wainwright goes into the Copper Queen, Dukes saloon, and slaps him.

Duke admits that he feels that he is meant for something... something big, something important, not what he is doing now, but he does not know what it is.

She answers a ringing public telephone and vanishes. Computer programmer Thomas Anderson, living a double life as the hacker Neo, feels something is wrong with the world and is puzzled by repeated online encounters with the cryptic phrase the Matrix. The woman, Trinity, contacts him, saying that a man named Morpheus can explain its meaning; however, the Agents, led by Agent Smith, apprehend Neo and attempt to threaten him into helping them capture the terrorist Morpheus. Undeterred, Neo meets Morpheus, who offers him a choice between a red pill that will show him the truth about the Matrix, and a blue pill that will return him to his former life. After swallowing the red pill, his reality disintegrates and Neo awakens, naked, weak and hairless, in a liquidfilled pod, one of countless others connected by cables to an elaborate electrical system. He is rescued and brought aboard Morpheus hovercraft, the Nebuchadnezzar. As Neo recuperates, Morpheus explains the truth: in the 21st century, intelligent machines waged war against their human creators. When humans blocked the machines access to solar energy, the machines retaliated by harvesting the humans bioelectric power. The Matrix is a shared simulation of the world, in which the minds of the harvested humans are trapped and pacified. All free humans live in Zion, the last refuge in the real world. Morpheus and his crew are a group of rebels who hack into the Matrix to unplug enslaved humans and recruit them; their understanding of the simulated reality enables them to bend its physical laws, granting them superhuman abilities. Morpheus warns Neo that death within the Matrix also kills the physical body, and that the Agents are powerful sentient programs that eliminate threats to the system. Neos prowess during virtual combat training lends credence to Morpheus belief that Neo is the One, an especially powerful human prophesied to free humans and end the war. The group enters the Matrix to visit the Oracle, a prophet who predicted the emergence of the One. She implies that Neo is not the One and warns Neo that he will have to choose between Morpheus life and his own. Before they can leave the Matrix, the group is ambushed by Agents and tactical police alerted by Cypher, a crew member who betrayed Morpheus to Smith in exchange for a comfortable life back in the Matrix. Morpheus allows himself to be captured so Neo and the rest of the crew can escape. Cypher exits the Matrix and murders several crew members as they lie defenseless in the real world. As he prepares to disconnect Neo and Trinity, Tank, a crewman whom he had left for dead, kills him. In the Matrix, the Agents interrogate Morpheus to learn his access codes to the mainframe computer in Zion. Tank proposes killing Morpheus to prevent this, but Neo, believing that he is not the One, resolves to return to the Matrix to rescue Morpheus; Trinity insists she accompany him. While rescuing Morpheus, Neo gains confidence in his abilities, performing feats comparable to the Agents. Morpheus and Trinity exit the Matrix, but Smith ambushes and kills Neo before he can leave. In the real world, machines called Sentinels attack the Nebuchadnezzar. Trinity whispers to Neo that he cant be dead because she loves him and the Oracle told her that she would fall in love with the One. She kisses Neo and he revives with the power to perceive and control the Matrix. He effortlessly defeats Smith and leaves the Matrix just as the ships electromagnetic pulse weapon disables the attacking Sentinels. Later, Neo makes a telephone call inside the Matrix, promising the machines that he will show their prisoners a world where anything is possible.

The police interrupt the wedding when corporate assistant officer Wada, who is the wedding receptions master of ceremony, is arrested on charges of bribery in a kickback scheme. The reporters comment this incident is similar to an earlier scandal involving Iwabuchi, administrative officer Moriyama, and contract officer Shirai. That earlier case was hushed up after the apparent suicide of Assistant Chief Furuya, by jumping off the corporate office building, creating a dead end in the investigation before any of the companys higherups could be implicated. Following the wedding, the police question Wada Kamatari Fujiwara and accountant Miura about bribery of government officials by the Unexploited Land Development Corporation. As a result of the inquiry, Miura commits suicide by running in front of a truck. When Wada attempts to take his own life by jumping into an active volcano, Nishi stops Wada. Nishi convinces Wada that his superiors are unworthy of the sacrifice he had been willing to make. From that point forward, Nishi uses Wada to further his plans for revenge. Nishi then focuses his efforts on contract officer Shirai Ko Nishimura, setting him up so that Iwabuchi and Moriyama believe him to be a thief. In the office from which Furuya jumped, Nishi reveals to Wada and Shirai that he is actually an illegitimate son of Furuya, determined to avenge his fathers death.

Iwabuchi tells her that her brother has left with his shotgun to find and kill Nishi. He asks her to tell him Nishis location so that he can stop her brother from committing murder, saying that he will then confess his crimes and turn himself in.

Despite Kennys knack for getting in trouble, they have always been close. After the murder, Kenny is initially brought in for questioning by Sergeant Nancy Taylor, but released. Two years later, based on new testimony from two witnesses, Kenny is arrested and tried. The evidence presented at Kennys trial is entirely circumstantial, but he is convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole. The three main witnesses against him are Sergeant Taylor, his exwife Brenda, and exgirlfriend Roseanna. Three years later, Betty Anne lives with her husband, Rick and two sons, Richard and Ben. She is frantic that she has not heard from Kenny, who calls her every week from prison, and finally discovers that he tried to commit suicide. Betty Anne decides to go back to school and become a lawyer so she can exonerate him, but her husband is skeptical and unsupportive, and eventually they split up. As Betty Anne struggles with being a working mother attending law school, flashbacks reveal that her mother was callous and uncaring, forcing Kenny and Betty Anne to fend for themselves. The two were very close, but frequently got into trouble, and were eventually taken away from their mother and sent to separate foster homes.

In a study group, Betty Anne learns about the new field of DNA testing and realizes that this could be the key to overturning Kennys conviction, as only blood types had been matched at the time of the trial.

The backlog of cases will mean waiting at least 18 months unless she can pass the bar exam and find the blood evidence from Kennys trial herself to have it tested. At first she is stonewalled, then told the evidence was destroyed, but she refuses to give up, and she and Abra embark on an odyssey to recover any evidence that might still be stored away somewhere. In the process, Betty Anne learns that Nancy Taylor was fired from the police department for fabricating evidence in another case, which deepens Betty Annes suspicions about Kennys conviction and the evidence presented at trial. Finally the DNA results come back and establish that the blood was not Kennys. Betty Anne and Kenny are overjoyed anticipating his release, but Martha Coakley, of the District Attorneys office, refuses to vacate the conviction, claiming that there was still enough evidence to convict Kenny as an accomplice. Kenny is convinced that no matter what, the authorities will find a way to keep him in prison to avoid admitting their mistake. Betty Anne is heartbroken again, but refuses to give up after Barry advises her that their discovery not only proves Kennys innocence, but also that the main witnesses against him were lying. Betty Anne, Abra, and Scheck visit the other two main trial witnesses, Kennys exwife and his exgirlfriend. Both tearfully confess that Sergeant Taylor coerced them into perjuring themselves at Kennys trial. With an affidavit from Kennys exwife and the DNA evidence, Kennys conviction is vacated and he is freed from prison in June 2001.

The Uboat evades RCN and RCAF patrols by moving north. A raiding party of six Nazi sailors are put ashore to obtain supplies but soon after, the Uboat is sunk in Hudson Bay by RCAF bombers. The six attempt to evade capture by travelling across Canada to reach the neutral United States and return to Germany. Led by Lieutenants Hirth Eric Portman and Kuhnecke Raymond Lovell, the small band of sailors encounter and sometimes brutalise a wide range of people. The band steadily diminishes as one by one they are killed or captured. Initial victims of the Nazi sailors are the Eskimo Nick Ley On and a FrenchCanadian trapper Laurence Olivier. When a floatplane is dispatched to investigate to reports of their arrival at a Hudsons Bay Company trading post, the Germans open fire, gunning down the pilot and some of the local Inuit. The Nazis steal the aircraft and take off to fly south, but not before one of the sailors is shot and killed by an Inuit. The floatplane runs out of fuel and crashes in a lake in Manitoba, killing Kuhnecke. The Germans encounter and are welcomed by a nearby Hutterite farming community. The Nazis assume them to be sympathetic to the German cause, but Hirths fanatical speech is rejected by Peter Anton Walbrook, the communitys leader and even by one of the fugitives, Vogel Niall MacGinnis, who comes to the aid of Anna Glynis Johns, a teenage girl. Vogel, who would rather join the community and ply his trade of baker, is tried by Hirth and summarily executed for desertion. The dwindling band arrive in Winnipeg and sell some field glasses for food. Hearing that the police are watching the border, Hirth decides they will travel to Vancouver to catch a steamship for neutral Japan. Knocking out or murdering a motorist for his car, Hirth, Lohrmann and Kranz flee west, having killed eleven civilians in all. Kranz is arrested by Canadian Mounties at a parade at Banff, Alberta. The two remaining men try to walk across the Rockies. They are welcomed at a camp by a writer named Philip Armstrong Scott Leslie Howard who takes them for lost tourists, but they turn on him, destroying his books and paintings before fleeing. Scott and his men pursue them. Lohrmann finally rebels against Hirths leadership, knocks him out and takes off by himself. Lohrmann is cornered in a cave. Scott is shot, but enters the cave and beats him up. Hirth is the last fugitive. The story comes to a head with a confrontation between him and Andy Brock Raymond Massey, Canadian soldier who is absent without leave, aboard the baggage and express car of a Canadian National Railways train near the American border. When Hirth learns that the train has crossed into the United States at Niagara Falls, he surrenders his gun to a customs official and demands to be taken to the German embassy. Brock explains that Hirth is wanted in Canada for murder, but while the U.S. border guards are sympathetic to Brocks plea, they cannot find any official reason to send Hirth back. When Brock points out that Hirth is not listed on the freight manifest, the Americans are happy to use this pretext to send the car, along with Hirth and Brock, back to Canada for improperly manifested cargo. The film ends with the trains reversing to Canada and Brock about to pummel Hirth in the baggage car.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

The intensity and frequency of the dreams have fluctuated over the course of her life, as has their content; some of her dreams are simply of glimpses of desolate locations that leave her feeling dread upon awakening, while others feature the gruesome deaths of her friends and loved ones at the hands of a supernatural force. Recently, her dreams have become more frequent and disturbing than ever, resulting in a shift in the quality of her work. Afraid that the dreams are aggravated by stress and depression, and fearful that her newfound success may be slipping away, Kays family and friends plan a vacation for her to a small island off the coast of Georgia. Accompanying Kay are her husband David, Kays brother Eric, who introduced her to David; and Erics wife Brooke. As the couples plane prepares to land, their pilot, Marsh, informs them that hes just received notification that an Atlantic hurricane has shifted course towards the island. Marsh hurriedly drops the couple off, telling them that he has to leave the island before hes stranded there. The couples discover that, against expectations, the island is deserted, and populated largely by derelict buildings and the ruins of a oncethriving resort town. Kay informs the rest of the quartet that the island is the place she has been dreaming about since childhood, and that they are all in danger if they stay there. Unable to leave due to the hurricane, Brooke, David, and Eric try to assuage her fears. The following evening, David is murdered by an unseen assailant, and Kay dreams of waking up next to his severed head. That day, she finds Davids decapitated body hanging in an abandoned playhouse on the island. Eric believes that Marsh never left the island and brought the couples there to kill them, a supposition that is granted some support when Marsh is later seen on the island. Kay believes that the island has allowed her dreams to cross over into reality, and that the creature from her nightmares is responsible\u2014a theory supported by the fact that the deaths only occur when Kay is asleep. Additionally, it becomes apparent that Kay herself may be the killer, murdering in the throes of a somnambulistic trance out of repressed resentment towards her loved ones. As night falls, Eric goes to retrieve flares from a boathouse, and is murdered on the beach before being dragged into the ocean. Later, Brooke is attacked in the boathouse and impaled with a pitchfork. After finding their bodies on the beach, Kay barricades herself in the beach house and struggles to stay awake, incessantly drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes to remain stimulated.

It is based on the assassination of Ma Xinyi in 1870. In the beginning, there is a battle between loyalists and rebels, during which all of the loyalists are killed except Qingyun, the general. Qingyun goes to a village nearby where the inhabitants engage in banditry, being led by two men, Erhu and Wuyang. He offers his assistance in executing a raid against a rebel convoy. However, a loyalist army assaults the village shortly afterward and seizes the spoils for themselves. Around this time, Qingyun begins an affair with Erhus wife. Since the villagers are poor and starving, Qingyun convinces them to fight the rebels as an independent loyalist warband. Erhu and Wuyang are distrustful of Qingyun, so the three of them perform a blood oath where, under the pain of death, they promise to care for each other like brothers. The warband wins a series of victories. Qingyun becomes ambitious and prepares to attack Suzhou and Nanjing. However, the government becomes fearful of Qingyuns growing influence, and decides to deny reinforcements and provisions. As a result, the attack on Suzhou becomes a yearlong siege. Erhu attempts to kill the enemy commander by sneaking into the city in disguise. He is quickly captured, but to his surprise, the enemy commander was already planning on surrendering, and allows Erhu to kill him in exchange for sparing his troops from execution. However, Qingyun refuses to honor the deal due to a lack of food and manpower to keep them prisoner. Qingyun temporarily detains Erhu to keep him from interfering. Afterwards, he has the prisoners locked in the palace courtyard and massacred with arrows from atop the walls. Embittered, Erhu considers desertion, but Qingyun convinces him that the attack on Nanjing will liberate millions of innocent lives. Nanjing is easily taken, and Qingyun, in return for his grand success, is awarded the position of Nanjings governor. As Qingyun waits for his inauguration, he tries to make friends with other upperclass people. Erhu, however, has been jaded by the war, and does improper things such as handing out bonus pay without permission. Qingyun responds by arranging for Erhus assassination, fearing a loss of reputation with the upperclass. Erhu, as he dies, curses the name of a rival, not realizing that he was betrayed by his own brother. Wuyang, having discovered Qingyuns betrayal and Qingyuns affair with Erhus wife, reacts by killing Erhus wife. On the day of the inauguration, Wuyang jumps out to kill Qingyun, but is unable to defeat him. It is then revealed, through a flashback, that Qingyuns promotion was fake, and that the governments real desire was to murder Qingyun for gaining too much influence. At this point, a government soldier appears behind Qingyun on a rooftop and shoots him in the back. Realizing he has been betrayed, a mortally wounded Qingyun allows Wuyang to fulfill their blood oath by killing him. The government then frames Wuyang for the murder and gets ready to execute him. The film closes with Wuyang observing that Dying is easy. Living is harder.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

They open it and discover packs of cash. They are chased by yet another car but get away. Back at their Hollywood apartment, they examine what Alan estimates to be 100,000 in cash. Jane wants to keep the money; Alan wants to take it to the police. He places the suitcase in a locker at Union Station, hoping he can sway Jane into surrendering it to the police. A few days later, Danny Duryea shows up at the Palmers apartment, tells Jane he is a detective and quickly learns she has begun spending the money. Alan likewise becomes upset when he finds she has been running up bills, clearly planning to spend the money they had agreed to leave untouched. Under Dannys persistent questioning, Jane confesses to Danny that she has the money, and makes a deal with him to split the money. She and Alan later plan a romantic evening together to make amends for their squabbling about the money. She asks Danny to meet her at Westlake Park near downtown Los Angeles, where she has planned to kill her husband Alan on a boat ride. Jane feels a pang of guilt, then blurts out that she wants to send the claim check for the locker to the police. Unaware of why his wife is upset, Alan picks up her bag and his own gun falls out. Jane can tell he knows what she has in mind. She grabs the gun, they struggle and she shoots, killing him. Danny sees the body and fears getting involved in a murder, but Jane threatens to tell the police he killed her husband unless he helps her. After dumping the body in the lake, they leave the park together so as to mislead witnesses into thinking she left with her husband. She reports Alan to the police as a missing person. Planning to kill Danny, she drives him up into the hills on the pretense they will retrieve the cash where its been buried. He suspects her intentions and flees. Don Blake DeFore appears at the Palmer apartment, where he discovers Alans sister Kathy Kristine Miller leaving surreptitiously. Don introduces himself to her as an old army buddy of Alans on vacation in Los Angeles. Kathy lives across the hall and has grown worried about her missing brother. She is leery of Jane, whose previous husband had a mysterious death. Jane finds out that Don never knew Alan and hits him over the head with a pistol. Retrieving the cash at Union Station, she finds a drunken Danny and asks him to help her run away. Jane demands to know where the money came from. Danny says it was a once in a lifetime blackmail payoff from an insurance scam. She understands this means the money is unmarked and its disappearance wont be reported to the police. She kills Danny with a poisoned drink. After finding Dannys body, the Los Angeles police tell Don that if he wants them to drag the small lake at Westlake Park in search of Janes missing husband, itll cost thousands of dollars and that they dont believe his theories. Jane flees with all the money to Mexico City, where she has a penthouse at the posh Reforma Hotel. Don turns up at her door. Concluding he is either after the money or with the police, Jane pleads with him to take half. Don tells her he is the brother of Janes earlier, first husband, Bob Blanchard, and that he now understands how she could have driven him into killing himself. As Mexican police detectives rush into the room, Jane quickly backs away in tears onto a balcony, then screams as she falls over the railing to her death.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

Huo An Jackie Chan, the captain, successfully averts a battle between the Indians and Huns. The group returns to their unnamed home city, where Huo Ans gentle Uyghur wife Xiuqing Mika Wang serves as a schoolteacher for orphans. However, the government uncovers evidence that someone in the group is corrupt, causing the entire group to be sentenced to construction work at Wild Geese Gate, a ruined fortress. Once they arrive, the group pays respects at the shrine of a fallen Chinese general. They originally were childslaves of Hun descent, but the general had later rescued them. Not long after, Wild Geese Gate is threatened by a legion from the Roman Empire in need of water and supplies, among which is a blind boy named Publius Jozef Waite. After a stalemated duel between Huo An and Lucius Cusack, the Roman general, the latter agrees not to assault the city in return for being let inside. The legion uses its superior engineering skills to speed up the construction work, an act which boosts the morale and happiness of the inhabitants, who are divided among several different ethnic groups, such as Chinese, Uyghur, and Turkic. Huo An returns the favor by sending men to assist Luciuss envoys in reaching the Parthian Empire. A celebration is later held and Huo An is made an honorary centurion. Lucius reveals that he and Publius are fleeing from Publiuss brother Tiberius Brody, a corrupt soldier who murdered their father, a Roman consul, and blinded Publius so Tiberius could become consul. As Tiberius approaches with 100,000 soldiers, Huo An insists on helping Lucius, pointing out that Tiberius is a threat to the Silk Road in its entirety. Shortly after Huo An leaves to find reinforcements, the corrupt group member from earlier sends Chinese soldiers to murder Xiuqing and attack Wild Geese Gate. The legion is imprisoned in the nonChinese trading city of Kroran, where Tiberius has chosen to camp. Tiberius proceeds to murder Publius. Huo An and the few loyal Chinese soldiers travel to Kroran, pretending to surrender, but once they are inside, they destroy the Roman legions cages. Huo An breaks into Luciuss special solitary cell, but is unable to free him. A fire breaks out, whereupon Lucius calls out to Huo An to take me home, and Huo An shoots an arrow to kill Lucius before the fire gets him. As Huo Ans and Luciuss soldiers are surrounded, the armies of several other nations arrive and fight against Tiberius, including the Indians, Huns, Uyghurs, and Turkics, all of whom are determined to preserve the Silk Roads safety. However, even their combined forces are unable to gain the upper hand. Finally, the envoys from earlier return with a massive host of Parthians, who had signed a special treaty with Publiuss father and who intend to avenge his memory. Tiberiuss soldiers lose their will to fight. Huo An challenges Tiberius to a duel and kills him. Upon hearing about the bravery of Luciuss legion, the Chinese emperor grants them the right to establish their own city, which they choose to name Regum. They accept Huo An as their commander, and Huo An, in turn, honors the deceased Chinese general by relocating the shrine to that city. As the centuries go on, the city fades from collective memory.

Scientists there declare that it is one component of an advanced portable nuclear weapon designed by an unknown, presumably hostile power. The discovery prompts Paul Reagan Richard Denning, chief of the Security Investigation Division SID, to send agent John Williams John Ireland to investigate the source of these components and to prevent them from being assembled into a functioning weapon. As more parts are smuggled into the United States, the investigation expands and a pattern begins to emerge which points to Marseilles, France. After uranium is found welded to the hull of a U.S. Navy submarine in New London, Connecticut, Williams continues his investigation aboard that submarine, now bound for the French port, undercover as a naval officer preparing a training film. While in Marseilles, he learns that civilians Margo Wayne Suzanne Dalbert and her husband Leo Wayne Peter Marshall are working with clarinet player Buzz Olin Richard Avonde and an unknown member of the submarines crew to smuggle the parts in special metal cases built by Pierre Neff George Dee.

Arriving in Washington, D.C., Williams escapes from his captors and contacts Reagan at SID headquarters where he finds Jackson and Magrew waiting for him in Reagans office.

Miglioriti stops by to tell them that Frank Hallet has reported his mother missing, and asks to see Rynns father, but Mario covers by saying that her father has gone to bed.

Suspicious, and looking for answers about the whereabouts of his mother and Rynns father, he tries to scare Rynn into talking by killing her pet hamster. Mario chases Frank away, and Rynn now trusts him enough to show him her secret. Her terminally ill father and abusive mother divorced long ago. To protect Rynn from being returned to her mothers custody after his death, he moved them to an isolated area and made plans to allow Rynn to live alone, then committed suicide in the ocean so his body would not be found. He also left Rynn with a jar of potassium cyanide, telling her that it was a sedative, to give to her mother if she ever came for her. Rynn coolly recounts how she put the powder in her mothers tea and watched her die. She learned embalming at the library in order to hide the body in the cellar. The trust between Rynn and Mario blossoms into romance. They bury the corpses in the garden during a heavy rain, and Mario catches a cold.

That night, as Rynn is going to bed, she is shocked to find Frank coming out of the cellar. Having put the pieces together and knowing the truth about Rynns parents, he attempts to blackmail her, offering to protect her secrets in exchange for sexual favours. Rynn, seemingly defeated and resigned to Franks demands, agrees to his suggestion that they have a cup of tea.

In his duties Boss meets Miss Pruit Barbara Leigh, a white schoolteacher, who initially offends Boss by talking of the fond memories she has of her familys black slaves, but earns his forgiveness and develops a romantic interest in him. When a gang of Jed Claytons men meet the mayor in the town saloon to extort supplies from the town an arrangement that the mayor allows on the understanding that the gang will do no harm to the town or its citizens, Boss and Amos kill one gang member and arrest two more  with one prisoner being killed as he attempts to escape town assisted by the mayor. Jed and his outlaws then attempt to help the imprisoned outlaw escape by blowing a hole in the prison wall using dynamite. During the resulting raid on the town Clara Mae is kidnapped and taken away by Jeds men, while a Mexican child named Poncho whom Boss had befriended is killed. Boss attempts to meet Jed and his gang at their hideout but is himself kidnapped, tied to a pole, and tortured. When Jed leaves at night to meet with the mayor, Amos is able to rescue an injured Boss with the help of Clara Mae, taking him to Miss Pruits house to recover. Knowing that Jed and his men will be riding through town the next day on their supply run, the bounty hunters plan an ambush. With the assistance of other residents such as the doctor and blacksmith of the town, Boss and Amos prepare by planting explosives around the town and take up firing positions out of sight. As the gang rides into town, they enter the cantina where Clara Mae is living. When she refuses Jeds advances, he murders her. They then move on to the town itself, while Boss and Amos launch their surprise attack. Boss follows Jed into the Saloon where they fight, and Boss finally kills Jed. As Boss steps outside, he is shot twice by Mayor Griffin, but manages to kill his attacker by throwing a knife at his chest. Now seriously wounded, Boss pleads with Amos to not let him die in a white folks town. Miss Pruit urges Boss to take her with him, though he declines. The movie concludes as Amos rides out of town with Boss towed on a wagon, his fate left ambiguous.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

Hinds and Martha Kildare Emma Dunn and childhood friend Alice Raymond Lynne Carver expect him to join his father in his medical practice. However, he is more ambitious, though he is unsure what he wants to do. He has accepted a job as an intern at Blair General, a large New York City hospital. He and the other new interns are being greeted by the hospitals administrator, Dr. Carew Walter Kingsford, when the famous wheelchairbound diagnostician Dr. Leonard Gillespie Lionel Barrymore bursts in and sizes up the newcomers. When Gillespie demands that the interns diagnose him on the spot, only Kildare takes up his challenge, prognosticating that he has a melanoma on his hand and a year to live. When Kildare hedges before Gillespies gruff, Gillespie dismisses interest in him. Later, Kildare is assigned ambulance duty with attendant Joe Wayman Nat Pendleton. His first call is a man who has passed out in a bar. Discarding the obvious conclusion of drunkenness, Kildare suspects the man has a serious medical problem. When Kildare has to respond to a second, more urgent call, he orders the skeptical Wayman to give the man oxygen all the way to the hospital. Wayman disregards his order and the man dies as a result. Kildare later takes the blame rather than have Wayman lose his job. Kildare then attends to Barbara Chanler Jo Ann Sayers, a young suicide victim. Despite finding no signs of life, Kildare refuses to give up and finally succeeds in reviving her. Barbara Chanler turns out to be the sole child and heiress of extremely wealthy Robert Chanler Pierre Watkin. Highly respected psychiatrist Dr. LanePorteus Monty Woolley diagnoses schizophrenia. Kildare, based on a short conversation he had with Barbara, is sure that she was driven to attempt suicide for more ordinary reasons. However, when Kildare refuses to divulge what she told him in strictest confidence, Carew suspends him. From a chance comment by Barbaras concerned fiance, Jack Hamilton Truman Bradley, Kildare is able to piece the clues together. After quarreling with Hamilton, Barbara had gone to a nightclub alone, where she had started drinking heavily. A man took her upstairs to a private room, and thats all she remembered of the night. She was found by a policeman wandering the streets and taken home. Fear of what might have happened during her blackout made her try to take her own life. When Kildare goes to Gillespie for advice, the older man broadly hints that he should ignore hospital rules. Kildare sneaks in to see Barbara to reassure her that nothing disgraceful happened. The man at the nightclub had recognized her and, fearful of what her rich father would do if he took advantage of her condition, he had simply dumped her on the street. Kildare then coaches Barbara on how to act so that LanePorteus does not have her confined to a mental institution. Unaware of these developments, the hospital board fires Kildare for insubordination. He tells his parents and Alice, who have come to see him, that he is ready to become his fathers partner. However, Gillespie has other ideas. All along, he had been testing Kildare. Now that he is sure of Kildares integrity, competence and most of all courage of convictions, Gillespie hires the young man as his assistant, to pass along as much as possible before he dies of what Kildare had correctly diagnosed.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

Anxious to get the hit done, Jerry suggests they perform the hit immediately; Tom refuses, and Stanley entertains them with jokes. As the phone rings, the film shifts to a flashback set ten years earlier, in 1984. Jerry, a youth employed at Billys used car dealership, joins Tom as he walks with Karl. Karl describes how a local gangster bit off the nose of Karls nephew. Disturbed by the audaciousness and brutality of the attack, Tom promises to look into the issue. However, Karl becomes spooked when they enter Toms car, and Karl begins bargaining with Tom, to Jerrys confusion. Tom agrees that the two are friends with a long history but strangles Karl after an apology. Jerry throws up but insists that he is otherwise fine. Toms next hit involves a trip out of state. Jerry tags along, and when he becomes surly, Tom allows him to accompany him to the site of the hit itself, a cinema. There, they meet an unnamed man who becomes annoyed with their loud conversation in which Jerry describes a domestic dispute with his girlfriend, Deb. The man in the cinema tells them the story about how he and his fiancee, Vicki, the star of the low budget action film he is watching, angered the mob. After hit men assassinate Vicki via a weapons mishap on the set, he goes into hiding and loses his will to live. Moved by the story, Jerry decides to marry his girlfriend, and the two hit men rise to leave. Jerry is surprised when Tom slits the throat of the man, and Tom admonishes him to not get so emotionally involved in the stories of their victims. On Jerrys first kill, the two track their victim to a Chinese restaurant. Nervous, Jerry becomes paranoid and makes a spectacle of himself in front of the victim. To calm him, Tom describes Ronald Reagans final acting performance, a coldblooded hit man in The Killers. Enthused by the thought of following in Reagans footsteps, Jerry is able to relax and make his first kill. Later, as the two wait for their next hit, Tom tells Jerry about their coworker, Vic, who is rumored to have had an affair with Marilyn Monroe and assassinated John F. Kennedy. When the target arrives, Jerry asks to make the hit himself, and Tom impatiently watches as Jerry awkwardly attempts to make a clean kill. After Jerry simply pulls out the pistol and shoots the man headon, they leave. Tom and Jerry join Vic for a meal, which Vic has prepared himself. During the conversation, Vic reveals that he intends to publish his memoirs. After Vic describes a feature film adaptation and talk show appearances that he has planned, the trio argue over the appropriateness of such actions and who should play each of them in a film. Tom suggests Don Knotts for Jerry, who becomes offended that the others dont take him seriously. Jerry pulls out a syringe and explains that he is diabetic, only to suddenly stab Vic with it. Surprised and angered, Tom castigates Jerry for killing Vic in such an undignified manner, as they had previously planned to take Vic out back and shoot him after he finished with his dinner, a death that Tom considered more proper for an assassin of Vics stature. In their final hit, Jerry panics and accidentally murders an innocent bystander. He then tells a disturbed Tom of how he occasionally fantasizes about killing his family, eventually admitting that he has pointed a loaded weapon at his infant sons head. In the present, the phone rings, and Tom reluctantly answers it; he is given the goahead and kills Jerry. After Tom unties Stanley, Stanley reveals that he has been tasked with killing Tom.

In 1995, Ray and Gary went to America to find Elvis memorabilia to sell on the market stall Ray runs in London. Harvey, a former US Army cameraman, sold them a silent black and white film of Elvis performing live, but later returned with an intriguing offer. Harvey took Ray to Miami, Florida to see a film from 1947 showing the autopsy of an alien supposedly killed in a UFO crash in Roswell, New Mexico. Harvey want to sell the film for 30,000. Gary and Ray returned to England to look for an investor to give them the money. Ray convinces Laszlo Voros, a Hungarian art dealer obsessed with crop circles, to give him the 30,000 and retrieves the film from Harvey. Back in England, that the film has degraded from humidity and heat and was now completely unwatchable, so the duo decided to film their own remake of the movie to avoid serious repercussions from Voros.

Once finished, Ray gave a copy of the new film to Voros, who believed it to be real. Having convinced Voros, Ray and Gary decide to sell the film to other venues, earning them lots of money. However, Voros heard that about the international distribution of the film, he demanded 80 of the profits. Good fortune intervened, however, when Voros was knocked down and killed by a green Land Rover whilst standing naked in the middle of a crop circle, leading to speculations that Voros was killed by a CIA agent. Ray and Gary traveled to Argentina to promote the film, followed by reporter Amber Fuentes, who seduced Ray. Amber eventually tracked down Harvey, who demanded from Ray and Gary that they help him keep his anonymity.

He masquerades frequently as the deposed prince of a small European country, seducing wealthy women into donating money and jewellery to his revolutionary cause. Meanwhile, Corporal Freddy Benson Marlon Brando is a smalltime operator in the US Army stationed in Germany, conning his way into the hearts and wallets of young women with sob stories about his sick grandmother. His attempt at seducing the daughter of a local burgomaster backfires when her father arrives home early, and Freddy is nearly arrested until he blackmails his colonel into giving him an early discharge. On a train to BeaumontSurMer, Freddy cockily displays his skill as a conman to Lawrence, whom he believes to be a henpecked husband. Lawrence, believing Freddys poaching will endanger his own activities, attempts to distract him into leaving town, then when that fails, arranges for his arrest. Lawrence has him released and buys him a plane ticket to America. Unfortunately, one of Lawrences former conquests Dody Goodman is on the plane and mistakes Freddy for a revolutionary in the employ of The Prince. Freddy returns and blackmails Lawrence into taking him on as an apprentice. Freddy is taught to play The Princes mentally challenged brother Ruprecht, a tactic to scare women away from trying to marry the prince. They are successful, but quarrel when Lawrence refuses to pay Freddy until he can acquire the culture necessary for Lawrences style of con. Freddy decides to set out on his own, but since Lawrence believes that there is not enough room in BeaumontSurMer for both of them, the two make a bet. The first one to steal 25,000 from a selected mark will stay. They choose Janet Walker Shirley Jones, a naive American heiress, as their target. Freddy poses as a soldier who has suffered psychosomatic paralysis. He wins Janets affections with a sad story about being betrayed by his first love and convinces her that he needs 25,000 to pay for treatment by a celebrated Swiss psychiatrist, Dr. Emile Shauffhausen. Lawrence then masquerades as Dr. Shauffhausen, agreeing to treat Freddys condition with the stipulation that Janet pay the 25,000 directly to him. The two battle for Janets affections, ruthlessly sabotaging each other, with Lawrence coming out on top, more often than not. Lawrence discovers that Janet is not wealthy after all, but merely a contest winner, and that she intends to sell off the remainder of her winnings to pay for Freddys treatment. Since he only preys on wealthy women who can afford it, Lawrence attempts to call off the bet. Freddy refuses, but suggests that they change the bet: the first to get her into bed will win. Lawrence refuses to try to seduce Janet, but bets that Freddy will fail to do so. Freddy has Lawrence kidnapped by some paratroopers he fools into believing Lawrence is trying to steal his girl. He then convinces Janet of his love by conquering his paralysis and walking. Lawrence has been present the whole time, and he now declares that Freddy is cured. Lawrence explains that he told the soldiers he had been a British Army paratrooper during the war, then filled them in on Freddys lies. The angry soldiers keep Freddy occupied until Lawrence puts Janet on a train. However, just as the train is departing, Janet receives a telegram stating that Dr. Emil Shauffausen has been dead for over 40 years. Confused and distraught, she returns to her hotel room, where she finds Freddy, who apparently succeeds in seducing her. Lawrence gracefully accepts defeat. Freddy surprisingly has had a change of heart; he found he could not take advantage of Janet, that his feelings for her were genuine. Instead, he has married her, is going straight, and they are returning to America. Lawrence reflects that Freddy has gotten the better deal in the end, but is distracted from this train of thought when his next target, a ravishing and extremely wealthy blonde, walks into the room.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

However, Father DeCarlo Rossano Brazzi, a priest from the Subiaco monastery where Father Spiletto spent his final days and observed Damien from afar since his adopted fathers death, acquires the Seven Daggers of Megiddo that were dug out of the ruins of the Thorn Museum in Chicago. Joined by six other priests, DeCarlo plans to kill Damien while finding the Christ Child. Meanwhile, Damien becomes romantically involved with journalist Kate Reynolds Lisa Harrow. Learning of his assassins and taking out all but DeCarlo over time, he proceeds to mold Reynoldss young son Peter Barnaby Holm into a disciple by playing on the boys desire for a father figure. After the alignment of stars in the Cassiopeia constellation on March 24, 1982, generating what is described as a second Star of Bethlehem, Damien realizes it is a sign of the Second Coming and orders his followers to kill all boys born in England on the morning of March 24, 1982 to prevent the Christ Childs return to power.

Agreeing to help DeCarlo, Reynolds tricks Damien with the promise to bring him to the church ruins where the Christ child is in exchange for Peter. The plan backfires when Damien spots DeCarlo first and uses Peter as a human shield against the dagger. As Peter dies in his mothers arms, Damien throttles Father DeCarlo before calling out for Christ to appear before him and face him. This leaves Damien open to be stabbed in the back by Reynolds using DeCarlos Megiddo dagger. As Damien staggers through the courtyard and collapses, a vision of Christ appears in the archway above him. Damien scolds Christ for thinking he has won, and then dies.

He writes the word Bitch on the wall with her blood. Her husband Jack is arrested for her murder by Thomas Krasny, a district attorney. Jack tries to hire highprofile lawyer Teddy Barnes to defend him. Barnes used to work for Krasny, and she is reluctant to take the case, as she stopped working in criminal law after an incident with Krasny. Krasny runs into Barnes. He tells her that Henry Styles hanged himself in his cell, which distresses her. Barnes visits Sam Ransom, a private detective who used to work for Krasnys office as well. He stopped private investigations at the same time that Barnes left Krasnys office, and it becomes clear that the Styles case was the reason. Barnes decides to take the case. While preparing for the trial, Barnes and Forrester spend a great deal of time together, and eventually sleep together. Ransom warns Barnes that Forrester is just trying to make her care more about his case. Her office begins receiving anonymous typed letters that mention things about the case. All of the letter ts are slightly raised, and analysis determines that they were written on a 1942 Corona typewriter. In a pretrial meeting, Barnes tells the judge that Krasny has a history of not meeting his discovery obligations. The prosecutions case relies mainly on circumstantial evidence. Witness Ginny Howell testifies that Paige told her she was divorcing Jack, but Barnes discredits her with evidence, including a love letter, that her advances had been rejected by Jack, causing Paige to cut off all communication with her. Barnes discredits Anthony Fabrizi, a lockerroom attendant at a private club who claims to have seen a hunting knife in Forresters locker, when he admits that the knife was in another members locker. Krasny calls Eileen Avery, who had an affair with Forrester. As Avery details her relationship with Forrester, Barnes finds it eerily similar to her own relationship with Forrester. She feels manipulated and now believes Forrester is guilty, but agrees to continue out of a sense of duty. Another note arrives at her office saying, He is innocent. Santa Cruz. January 21, 1984. Ask Julie Jensen. Barnes interviews Jensen, who testifies at the trial that she was attacked in the same manner as Paige Forrester. All the details match, but she says her attacker seemed to stop himself from killing her. As Krasny objects that the attack on Jensen is unrelated to the one on Forrester, he lets slip that his office had investigated the attack and not revealed it in discovery. In chambers, the judge threatens to have Krasny disbarred. Krasny insists that Forrester staged the earlier attack in order to create an alibi of sorts for Paiges murder, which he had planned for 18 months. Krasny also insists that Forrester has been sending Barnes the anonymous notes. After Forrester is found not guilty, Barnes announces to the media that she left Krasnys office over the Henry Styles case, where Krasny suppressed evidence that proved Styles was innocent. Krasny walks off in disgust. Barnes goes to Forresters house to celebrate, and they sleep together again. In the morning, she discovers a typewriter in his closet. She tests it, and the t is raised, just as in the anonymous notes. She throws clothing over the typewriter and flees with it, pretending to Forrester that her little boy is sick. When Forrester calls, she tells him that she found the typewriter. Forrester says that he is baffled and that he is coming over. Barnes calls Ransom, on the brink of telling him that Forrester is a killer, but instead hangs up. A masked figure breaks in and confronts her in her bedroom. As he starts to attack, Barnes throws back the covers to reveal her gun. She shoots him several times until he falls to the floor. Ransom comes in and unmasks the attacker: It is Forrester.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

However, they are betrayed by Milady, who incapacitates them and sells the blueprints to the Duke of Buckingham. A year later, dArtagnan leaves his village in Gascony for Paris in hopes of becoming a musketeer as his father was, only to learn that they were disbanded. At a rural bar, he challenges Captain Rochefort, leader of Cardinal Richelieus guard, to a duel after being offended by him, but Rochefort merely shoots him while hes distracted. Once in Paris, dArtagnan separately encounters Athos, Porthos and Aramis and, accidentally offending all three, schedules separate duels with each. Athos brings Porthos and Aramis to the duel as his seconds, causing dArtagnan to realize their true identities. Richelieus guards arrive to apprehend them, but, inspired by dArtagnan, the musketeers fight together and win. All four are summoned before the young King Louis XIII and Richelieu urges him to execute them, but Queen Anne is impressed by their bravery and the king condecorates them instead. Richelieu instructs Milady, now his accomplice, to plant false love letters among Queen Annes possessions, steal her diamond necklace, and take it to the Tower of London in order to frame her as having an affair with Buckingham, which would force King Louis to execute her and declare war on England. At this point, the people would demand a more experienced leader: Richelieu himself. In order to secure her own position, Milady demands that Richelieu declare in a written authorization that she is working on behalf of France. The false letters are found and given to King Louis, who is advised by Richelieu to set up a ball at which Queen Anne would be forced to wear the necklace. If she doesnt, then her affair is real, and there will be war. Queen Annes ladyinwaiting Constance Bonacieux discovers Richelieus plan and pleads with the musketeers to stop him. They follow Milady and Buckingham to London, while Constance is captured by Rochefort for helping the musketeers to escape from him. In London, Milady tells Buckingham the musketeers have arrived to take revenge on him and teaches him all their tendencies in battle. DArtagnan is captured, but turns out to be a decoy, allowing his associates to steal Buckinghams airship and rescue him. Miladys getaway coachman reveals himself as the musketeers manservant Planchet and delivers her to his masters, who retrieve the necklace from her. Athos prepares to execute Milady for her treachery, but she leaps off the airship, apparently dying on her own terms. The musketeers depart back to Paris, only to be intercepted by Rochefort in a much larger airship, for Milady had given Richelieu copies of da Vincis blueprints. Rochefort offers to exchange Constance for the necklace, but captures dArtagnan and mounts an assault as soon as he retrieves the jewels. His superior airship has the upper hand and severely damages the opposing vessel, but the musketeers use the clouds to rally and counterattack. The fight ends when both ships ram each other, crashing onto Notre Dame. On the roof, dArtagnan duels and ultimately kills Rochefort. Constance is sent ahead to quietly return the necklace to Queen Anne.The musketeers arrive at the ball and, for the sake of King Louis and his people, lie by claiming that Rochefort tried to sabotage an airship that Richelieu built for them, and that they executed him for his treason on Richelieus permission. To convince the king, Athos presents Miladys authorization, which the former accepts. Richelieu, satisfied, offers the musketeers a place in his guards, but they refuse, and Richelieu vows revenge. Meanwhile, Milady is found alive at the English Channel by Buckingham, who declares his intention to exact revenge. The camera then pulls back to show him advancing towards France with a massive fleet of battleships and airships.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

The other sailor screams in terror as something rises from the water. When the patrol boat does not answer radio calls, Lt. Cmdr. John Twill Twillinger Tim Holt takes a rescue party out on a second patrol boat to investigate. They find the deserted patrol boat covered in a strange slime; the jumpers body then floats to the surface, now blackened and drained of bodily fluids. Twill takes a sample of the slime to the base lab for analysis, where he teams up with recently widowed Gail MacKenzie Audrey Dalton and Dr. Jess Rogers Hans Conried. A young couple disappear after going for a swim. U.S. Navy divers investigate and discover a giant egg and the body of one of the victims on the ocean floor. The divers are attacked by a giant mollusk, which kills one of the divers. The mollusk attacks the boat, but Twill stabs it in the eye with a grappling hook. The egg is taken to the U.S. Navy lab for study and kept under temperature control to prevent it from hatching. The mollusks escape into an irrigation canal system, attacking livestock, a lock keeper, a trysting couple, and others. Navy divers locate a group of mollusks in the canal system, and use explosives to destroy them. In the meantime, Gail is at the lab with her young daughter, Sandy Mimi Gibson. Worried about the lab rabbits being cold in the labs lowered temperature, Sandy surreptitiously turns up the thermostat. Twill calls the lab and gets no answer. He arrives and finds that the hatched mollusk has Gail and Sandy cornered in a closet, where they ran to escape from the monster. He fights it with lab chemicals and a CO2 fire extinguisher until other Navy personnel arrive and shoot the mollusk.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

She sentenced the crew to be turned into trash cans, and Captain EO to 100 years of torture in her deepest dungeon. Before being sent away, Captain EO told the Supreme Leader that he saw the beauty hidden within her, and that he brought her the key to unlock it: his song, We Are Here to Change the World. The two robot members of the crew transformed into musical instruments, and the crew members began to play the various instruments. As Hooter ran toward his instrument, he tripped over EOs cape and broke it, stopping the music. The spell broken, the Supreme Leader ordered her guards to capture Captain EO and his crew. Hooter managed to repair his instrument and sent out a blast of music, providing EO with the power to throw off the guards. He used his power to transform the dark hulking guards into agile dancers who fell into step behind him for a dance number. As EO pressed forward toward the Supreme Leader, she unleashed her Whip Warriors, two cybernetic defenders each with a whip and shield that could deflect EOs power. The others all ran away, leaving Captain EO to fight the Whip Warriors alone. EO was trapped by a closing gate and was preparing for a last stand as both the whip warriors drew their whips back for a final blow. Fuzzball dropped his instrument and speedily flew over to tie the two whips together, causing the Whip Warriors to be thrown off balance and giving EO an opportunity to transform them as well. With no further obstacles, EO used his power to transform the remaining four henchmen not yet unleashed and they, the transformed whip warriors and the other dancers, pressed forward in dance before EO transformed the Supreme Leader into a beautiful woman, her lair into a peaceful Greek temple, and the planet into a verdant paradise. A celebration broke out to Another Part of Me, as Captain EO and his crew triumphantly exited and flew off into space. Captain EO made full use of its 3D effects. The action on the screen extended into the audience, including asteroids, lasers, laser impacts, smoke effects, and starfields that filled the theater. These effects resulted in the seventeenminute film costing an estimated 30 million to produce. At the time, it was the most expensive film ever produced on a perminute basis, averaging out at 1.76 million per minute. The 2010 version did not include the intheater laser and starfield effects. It did utilize hydraulics previously used for Honey, I Shrunk the Audience! to make the seats shake along with Captain EOs spaceship, as well as LED floodlighting which was new to the theater. They were also used for the bassheavy musical numbers. The seats also bounced to the beat of Jacksons song. Honey, I Shrunk the Audience!s hidden water sprayers were employed when Hooter sneezed. The leg ticklers from Honey, I Shrunk the Audience were also reused for the Supreme Leaders Whip Warriors. The shows orchestral score was composed by James Horner, additional score was composed and performed by Tim Truman, while the area and preshow music was written by Richard Bellis. Two new songs appeared in the film. The first was an early mix of Another Part of Me. The song was remixed and later appeared on Jacksons hugely successful Bad album. It was released as a single in 1988. We Are Here to Change the World was not officially released until 2004 as part of Michael Jackson: The Ultimate Collection. However, this version was a shorter edit of the fulllength song. SoulRB singer Deniece Williams covered the song on her As Good As It Gets album in 1988.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

Sherman and Maria are driving back to Marias apartment from JFK Airport when they take a wrong turn on the expressway and find themselves in the warzone of the South Bronx. They are approached by two black youths after Sherman gets out of the car to move a tire out of the road. Sherman jumps back into the car and Maria guns the engine in reverse, running over one of the teenagers. The two drive away. Sherman initially wants to report the incident to the police, but Maria immediately talks him out of it, fearing that their affair would be publicly exposed. Meanwhile, alcoholic journalist Peter Fallow, anxious for a story to make good with his editor, comes upon the hitandrun case as a rallying point for the black community calling upon Jewish district attorney Abe Weiss, who is the Bronx District Attorney seeking reelection. According to Judge Leonard White, almost all of DA Weiss prosecutions end up with black and Puerto Rican defendants going to prison and Weiss is seeking a white defendant for purposes of convincing the minoritymajority community that he is worth reelecting. Weiss recognizes the press coverage inherent in prosecuting the callow Sherman, who has been discovered as the owner of the car, and therefore presumed to be the hitandrun driver, in order to cultivate the image as an avenger for the minorities and be propelled to the mayorship of New York City. As Sherman is brought to his knees, New York City fragments into different factions who use the case to suit their own cynical purposes. Finally, Sherman is left without any allies to support him except for the sympathetic Judge Leonard White and the remorseful Fallow. Fallow gains a tremendous advantage and insight into the case when he is dating a woman who is the subletting landlord of Marias apartment, and knows of secret recordings of conversations in the apartment made by the authorities to prove that the woman is not in fact living in the rentcontrolled apartment herself. She discovers information about the McCoy case where Maria states she was driving the car, which she gives to Fallow, who in turn covertly supplies it to McCoys defense attorney. Sherman gets his hands on a tape and plays the recording in court, where it reveals Maria directly contradicting the evidence she has just given, showing she has been perjuring herself and causing her to faint. Sherman plays the tape in a tape recorder inside his briefcase connected to a small loudspeaker that he holds on the desk. When the judge orders that he approach the bench with this evidence, he asserts that the tape is his making it admissible evidence, resulting in his acquittal. The people in the court go into an uproar, to which Judge White launches into a tirade that they have no right to act selfrighteous and smarmy, or that they are above Sherman, considering Reverend Bacon claims to help disadvantaged New Yorkers but actually engages in race baiting, or that the District Attorney Weiss pushed this case not in the interest of justice but in the interest of appealing to minority voters to further his political career by appealing to their desire to get even. After the Judge made his point, he begs the people to be decent and change their ways, letting Sherman go. A large audience is applauding Peter Fallows premiere of his book.

The town hires lawman and peacekeeper Virgil Cole Ed Harris and his deputy Everett Hitch Viggo Mortensen to protect and regain control of the town. The pair agrees on one condition: that the town follow Coles law and essentially cede control to him. The lawmen begin by confronting four of Braggs men who are causing a disturbance in the saloon. Three men refuse to allow themselves to be arrested, forcing Cole and Hitch to kill them. The fourth man surrenders and leaves the saloon. Bragg has a meeting with Cole and Hitch, initiating a standoff. Hitch sees a woman, Allie French Renee Zellweger, who just came to the town and immediately takes an interest in her. He follows her to the diner where Cole is having a breakfast. They make acquaintance with her and observing Cole and Allie are getting together well, Hitch keeps his silence. Soon, Cole and Allie begin a romantic relationship and buy a house together. However, Allie attempts to seduce Hitch when they are alone but Hitch refuses her advances out of his loyalty to Cole. When one of Braggs men tells Cole and Hitch that he will testify against Bragg on the triple murder case, they arrest Bragg and keep him locked up until the trial in spite of the attempts of Braggs gang to free him. The trial finds him guilty and sentences him to death. Cole, Hitch and several deputies transport Bragg via train to the prison where he was to be hanged but when they stop for refueling over a bridge, hired guns Ring and Mackie Shelton Lance Henriksen and Adam Nelson, old acquaintances of Cole, appear with Allie at gunpoint, forcing Cole to release Bragg to them. Cole and Hitch catch up with the outlaws and see Allie and Ring Shelton frolicking naked together in a stream. When the outlaws are attacked by Chiricahua Apache, Cole and Hitch force the Indians away. Hitch tells Cole that Allies promiscuity is the result of her insecurity and she really likes Cole. They then turn Bragg over to the sheriff of Beauville; unbeknownst to Cole, the sheriff is a cousin of the Shelton brothers. Knowing that Cole is determined to bring Bragg to the gallows, the Sheltons and the sheriff free Bragg and engage Cole and Hitch in a gunfight. Cole and Hitch are wounded but manage to kill Ring, Mackie and the sheriff. Bragg escapes on horseback and Cole and Hitch return to Appaloosa with Allie. After some time, Bragg is granted a full pardon by President Chester Arthur whom he previously claimed to have known and returns to Appaloosa in an attempt to publicly reform himself. He buys the hotel and ingratiates himself with the locals. Privately he brags before Cole and Hitch to infuriate them over their failure to hang him. Cole tells Hitch that he still wants to be with Allie, despite her fickleness. Hitch decides to leave the town to make some money and resigns as deputy. Later he discovers that Allie is having a relationship with Bragg and challenges Bragg to a duel. Cole attempts to stop him, but Hitch remains steadfast and asks Cole to permit the gunfight to occur. Hitch manages to fire first just before Bragg fires but Braggs shot misses, and Hitch hits Bragg in the throat, killing him. Hitch leaves town, seeing that Allie and Cole are together; his parting thoughts express his hope that Cole can find happiness with Allie and for him, he gladly walks into uncertainty in hope of finding adventure and fortune.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

At a party one evening, Tom challenges Lisa, Maggies sister who is a believer in paranormal activity, to hypnotize him. After putting him under, Lisa plants a posthypnotic suggestion in Tom urging him to be more openminded. Tom then begins experiencing visions of a violent scuffle involving a girl who he later learns is Samantha Kozac, a 17yearold that disappeared from the neighborhood six months prior. While Tom and Maggie attend a high school football game, Jake is overheard by his babysitter, Debbie Kozac, as he speaks with Samantha. Debbie gets upset and snatches Jake, running off with him in the night. Meanwhile, Tom senses Jake is in danger and rushes home but finds him gone. Tom then sees strange flashes of red light that eventually leads him to the L station where Debbie is speaking with her mother about Jake. When Tom and Maggie confront her, Debbie angrily questions them about her sister Samantha, explaining that she had an intellectual disability: having the mental capacity of an eighthyearold and thus a childs tendency to trust strangers. Tom denies knowing her to Debbie but admits to Maggie that she is the girl in his visions. Tom becomes obsessed with Samantha and begins probing members of the community about her disappearance. This attracts the attention of his landlord Harry Damon, Toms friend, Frank McCarthy and their respective sons Kurt Damon and Adam McCarthy, who all dismiss Samantha as a runaway teen. During an afternoon walk, Jake and Maggie encounter a funeral where Chicago policemen are saluting in a ceremony; here a policeman named Neil immediately recognizes Jakes unique talent and invites Tom to a private gathering of likeminded people to learn more about what is happening to his son. Maggie withholds her conversation with Neil from Tom and goes to the meeting herself, and Neil tells her the spirit that contacted Tom has asked for something and will grow upset if it does not get done. As predicted, Samantha begins plaguing Tom, eventually leading to his insomnia. He goes back to Lisa and demands she undo what she did, but when she hypnotizes him, Samantha tells him to dig. Tom complies and digs holes in the backyard and eventually tears up the house in a desperate attempt to appease Samantha. While Maggie and Jake attend her grandmothers wake at a relatives house, Tom inadvertently knocks down a shoddy brick wall in the basement and discovers Samanthas decomposed remains. He receives a vision showing him that before his family moved in, Adam and Kurt lured Samantha into the house to rape her. When she resisted, they unintentionally suffocated her and hid her body. Tom brings Frank back to the basement to disclose to him the crime. Frank breaks down and admits that Adam and Kurt had already confided their secret to him and Harry. Frank pulls out a gun and demands to be alone. As Tom leaves the basement, he hears a single shot. Harry and Kurt suddenly show up. Harry, in his capacity as landlord, voices displeasure with the torn up house. They corner Tom with the intention of killing him, but Maggie interrupts them when she arrives back home. As Harry takes her hostage, Frank emerges from the basement and fatally shoots both Kurt and Harry to save Tom and Maggie. Tom notices Samanthas spirit put on her glasses and coat, smile as she walks down the road, and disappear. Afterwards, the family packs up a UHaul and moves out of the house. Meanwhile, Samanthas mother and sister are finally able to give her a proper funeral and burial.

He sees her shed tears over two names carved on a tree trunk; the fading legends Radha and Ravi tell the tragic tale of love and loss. He follows her as he goes to a humble cottage and eavesdrops as she introduces herself to the incredulous old woman Pushpalatha as her dead daughter Radha.

She tells excitedly that in the 5 days before new moon, if she can have a physical union with Ravi even once, she would be alive again. And if she didn\u2019t succeed? Well, she would push Ravi down the same waterfall where she had met her end, so that they could unite in the other world.

Claudio has been thinking of Leonatos beautiful daughter Hero since before he went to war, and returns to find her as attractive as ever.

Jo was born a commoner, and looks forward to upgrading his social status after serving the royal family for thirty years. Careful to use the traditional rules and patterns, Dolseok denies the Queens request when she asks him to replace the kings robe that was accidentally burnt by a gungnyeo female attendant. He insists that to do so would be against court customs, but also simply impossible in the short time before the robe is needed. Anxious to cover her mistake, the Queen looks for a designer elsewhere. She is introduced to Lee Gongjin, a young designer whose good looks and expertise at making unconventional hanboks have charmed many women in the capital. He invented the bellshaped design of hanboks and introduced new colors. Gongjin falls in love with the Queen at first sight and uses his extraordinary gift as a tailor to save the dress. He subsequently becomes a tailor at the Sanguiwon and begins a prosperous career. He repeatedly uses his craft to support the Queen, who is at risk of being dethroned and replaced because she and the King  who never visits her  have no children. Soon Dolseok becomes jealous of the young designers talent, whose creativeness he cannot rival with his use of the traditional shapes. He fears his own position will be undermined. He lets the King use him to frame Gongjin for attempting to assassinate the King. The King then tries to lay the blame on the Queen for inciting the young tailor, but Gongjin saves the Queen by claiming he acted on his own motives. Even when the young designer awaits his execution, the head tailor vows to have his name erased from history. Only when Gongjin is dead, not only the queen, but eventually also Dolseok silently mourn his death. At the end of the film, women of Joseon are seen wearing Gongjins bellshaped, merrily colored hanboks.

These include a Las Vegas mobster as well as a ruthless drug smuggler known as the Candy Man and a crooked overbearing U.S. Army sergeant and his meekmannered partner the Major, who conspire on a big heroin and LSD smuggling score. Joe Collins Warren Beatty, an American bank security consultant, has been spying on them and makes mysterious and elaborate preparations to steal their money totaling more than 1.5 million with the help of Dawn Divine Goldie Hawn, a hooker with a heart of gold. Joe has Dawn phone in a bomb threat to the bank president, Mr. Kessel Gert Frobe, to create a diversion. Joe locks himself inside the bank vault with a gold bar normally displayed in the lobby to supposedly save it. The bank is closed and evacuated while Joe uses duplicate keys to empty the criminals three safe deposit boxes into Dawns largesize deposit box. It is implied that Joe had obtained the necessary bank information and secretly copied the criminals keys while they were engaged in sexual trysts with Dawn. Despite the fact that Kessel insists on burning through the wall to rescue Joe instead of waiting for the time lock to open, Joe succeeds in the heist and is hailed as a hero for preventing the robbery of the gold bar. The next day, the three criminals, one by one, discover that their boxes are empty, and thus they cannot complete their illegal schemes, nor do they dare to go to the police to report the thefts, since they themselves would then risk revealing their own dishonest pasts. The Las Vegas mobster flees the country while the others Sarge, his partner the Major, and the Candy Man search Dawn Divines apartment\u2014as she was their common link\u2014and find clues that connect her to Joe.

A long climactic chase begins as Dawn gives the Major the slip at the train station while the Candy Man and the Sarge chase Joe across a rail yard and through the Elbe Tunnel. Joe escapes on a car carrier truck, lugging his suitcase, but the Candy Man and the Sarge follow and catch up in the morning at a frozen lake in the countryside, where the Candy Man crashes his car through the ice and drowns. Joe escapes again by hopping a train, but during the night the Sarge catches up to him, only to find that Joes suitcase contains nothing but a bottle of champagne and wads of newspaper. They conclude that Dawn doublecrossed Joe by repacking the suitcases while he was getting the car, and the Sarge proposes a plan to Joe to go after Dawn together. But, upon drinking a swallow of the champagne, the Sarge instantly goes into violent convulsions and falls down dead. The bottle was one of three that the Candy Man had filled with a solution of concentrated LSD to sneak through customs earlier in the film. An epilogue shows Dawn in a sunny climate in the USA, joyfully driving a gleaming new yellow Corvette, and then later cuddling in bed with an unseen someone. The other suitcase is sitting near the bed, and Joes bomber jacket hangs on the coat rack. Dawn smugly explains to Joe that she was certain the criminals wouldnt kill him and leave themselves with no way to get the money.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

He goes to his native New Jersey to attempt to reconnect with his working class father Larry and brothers Luke and Scrappy by helping them in the coal mines. Dereks delicate methods make him an impractical miner, and his family rejects him. Meanwhile, fashion mogul Jacobim Mugatu and Dereks agent Maury Ballstein are charged by the fashion industry with finding a model who can be brainwashed into assassinating the new progressiveleaning Prime Minister of Malaysia, allowing them to retain cheap child labor in the country.

He and his team work to create a sentient computer; he predicts that such a computer will create a technological singularity, or in his words Transcendence. His wife, Evelyn Rebecca Hall, is also a scientist and helps him with his work. Following one of Wills presentations, an antitechnology terrorist group called Revolutionary Independence From Technology R.I.F.T. shoots Will with a poloniumlaced bullet and carries out a series of synchronized attacks on A.I. laboratories across the country. Will is given no more than a month to live. In desperation, Evelyn comes up with a plan to upload Wills consciousness into the quantum computer that the project has developed. His best friend and fellow researcher, Max Waters Paul Bettany, questions the wisdom of this choice, reasoning that the uploaded Will would be only an imitation of the real person. Wills consciousness survives his bodys death in this technological form and requests to be connected to the Internet to grow in capability and knowledge. Max refuses to have any part of the experiment. Evelyn demands that Max leave and connects the computer intelligence to the Internet via satellite. R.I.F.T.s leader Bree Kate Mara kidnaps Max and eventually persuades him to join the group. The government is also suspicious of what Wills uploaded consciousness will do and plans to use the terrorists to take the blame for the governments actions to stop him. In his virtual form and with Evelyns help, Will uses his newfound vast capabilities to build a technological utopia in a remote desert town called Brightwood, where he spearheads the development of groundbreaking technologies in medicine, energy, biology, and nanotechnology. Evelyn, however, grows fearful of Wills motives when he displays the ability to remotely connect to and control peoples minds after they have been subjected to his nanoparticles. FBI agent Donald Buchanan Cillian Murphy, with the help of government scientist Joseph Tagger Morgan Freeman, plans to stop the sentient entity from spreading. As Will has already spread his influence to all the networked computer technology in the world, Max and R.I.F.T. develop a computer virus with the purpose of deleting Wills source code, destroying him. Evelyn plans to upload the virus by infecting herself and then having Will upload her consciousness. A side effect of the virus would be the destruction of technological civilization. This would also disable the nanoparticles, which have spread in the water, through the wind and have already started to eradicate pollution, disease, and human mortality. When Evelyn goes back to the research center, she is stunned to see Will in a newly created organic body identical to his old one. Will welcomes her but is instantly aware that she is carrying the virus and intends to destroy him. The FBI and the members of R.I.F.T. attack the base with artillery, destroying much of its power supply and fatally wounding Evelyn. When Bree threatens to kill Max unless Will uploads the virus, Will explains that he has only enough power either to heal Evelyns physical body or upload the virus. Evelyn tells Will that Max should not die because of what theyve done, so Will uploads the virus to save Max. As Will dies, he explains to Evelyn that he did what he did for her, as she had pursued science to repair the damage humans had done to the ecosystems. In their last moment, he tells Evelyn to think about their garden. The virus kills both Will and Evelyn, and a global technology collapse and blackout ensues. Five years later, in Will and Evelyns garden at their old home in Berkeley, Max notices that their sunflowers are the only blooming plants. Upon closer examination, he notices that a drop of water falling from a sunflower petal instantly cleanses a puddle of oil \u2014 and realizes that the Faraday cage around the garden has protected a sample of Wills sentient nanoparticles.

Afterwards, Mort picks up the magazine sent by his literary agent. He finds the package already opened and the pages containing the story cut out. Back at his cabin, Mort sees Shooters hat. Mort wears the hat and begins speaking to himself, trying to make sense of the events. Mort realizes that Shooter is just a figment of his imagination; brought to life through Morts undetected dissociative identity disorder, and carried out malevolent tasks like killing Chico, Tom, Ken and burning down his house. When Amy arrives at the cabin, she finds it in disorder, with the word SHOOTER carved repeatedly on the walls. Mort appears behind her and Amy realizes that the name represents Morts desire to SHOOT HER. Mort, speaking with Shooters accent and wearing his hat, chases Amy and stabs her in the ankle.

Confused, mortified, bored, and directionless, newly single Gopal lies to his few IndianAmerican acquaintances about the situation, and refuses to answer his daughters phone calls from Mongolia.

Official investigators from the Department Six, acting on a tipoff, rush in full force to apprehend a suspect who is trying to sell a coin die stolen from the imperial mint, only to find the suspect and the evidence being taken into custody by agents of a hitherto unknown secret service, known as the Divine Constabulary, which is commissioned by the Emperor himself. This arouses jealousy in Commandant Liu, who openly fires Cold Blood, one of his best men. Liu secretly orders Cold Blood to infiltrate the Divine Constabulary to find a way to bring down the rival agency. Liu is unaware that his own establishment has been infiltrated by doubleagents dispatched by the mastermind behind the counterfeit currency. Despite being aware of Cold Bloods true mission, the chief of the Divine Constabulary seeks out Cold Blood and welcomes him into the agency. Once inside, Cold Blood is surprised to observe that the Divine Constabulary staff live and work together more like a family than a highly formalised professional security force.

Sure that Toms theory is sound, Dexters daughter Ruth convinces Ed Tyler, a locomotive manufacturer, to look into Toms design. Tyler is impressed with the concept and initiates immediate construction of a prototype. Soon Tom and his team prepare the Silver Streak for a wellpublicized trial run with Dexter and Ruth aboard as passengers. The Silver Streak fails to attain even half of its projected speed of 100 miles per hour 160 kmh, however, and is even easily overtaken by a steampowered freight train.

Engles warns him to look out for a Carla Rometta and sends along a cameraman, Joe Wesson, to accompany him. At the inn, Aldo, the indifferent innkeeper, tells themthat there are no rooms available, however guest Stefano Valdini helps them to find a room. Englishman Gilbert Mayne also takes a room. Blair soon encounters Rometta, who calls herself the Comtessa Forelli. That night, a Greek named Keramikos also arrives. When Blair makes his first report, Engles is particularly interested in the fact that the hut is to be auctioned off the next day. The proprietor of the hotel below confides to Blair that the auction is rigged and that there will only be one bid, his, but instead there is a heated bidding war involving Valdini on the Comtessas behalf and a lawyer for an unknown party. The latter wins the auction by making an excessive bid. Keramikos tells Blair that he is not truly there to write a script. He also claims that Mayne was a deserter from the British Army who ended up working for him in Greece, though he declines to divulge any more. Blair begins falling in love with the comtessa, who admits she is Carla. Very late at night, by chance, Blair spots Keramikos speaking German with another man.

At Carlas urging, Stelben left the gold at the hut and, after shooting his own men, reported he had been ambushed. The badly wounded Corporal Holtz survived and was later persuaded to relate his story to Kellerman. Kellerman wants the gold to finance the rebuilding of a fascist Germany. When Carla attacks Mayne after learning that he had agreed to kill her and Valdini, he knocks her unconscious. Valdini throws a knife at him. Mayne shoots him dead, but is knifed in the back by Aldo on Kellermans order. Kellerman produces a pistol, has Carla locked up, and orders the Englishmen to dig for the gold. Mayne comes to and tries to free Carla, but knocks over a lamp that sets the building on fire, then succumbs. When no gold is found, Kellerman does not believe that Engles does not know where it is and shoots him. In the ensuing fight, Wesson drags the unconscious Blair out of the basement.

All the guests in the retirement home continue to be engaged in their former professions in one way or the other, including lecturing and initiating young people to music. Finances threaten closure of the home, but proceeds from a yearly gala concert on Verdis birthday hold hope for a continuation of the place. However, Cedric has become rather desperate because some of the most prominent singers have either died or decided not to participate at all. Reg, Wilf and Cissy were in the cast of a very highly rated recording of the opera Rigoletto, which includes a famous quartet for soprano, mezzosoprano, tenor and baritone Bella figlia dellamore. This version is very prominent among opera buffs as THE Rigoletto of the postwar era. One day, Reg is shocked to find his former wife Jean Horton, the missing soprano of the Rigoletto recording, turning up to live at Beecham House. Reg is angry not to have been warned as their parting was on very sour terms. At first, Jean tries unsuccessfully to mend things with Reg. In the ensuing conversations her infidelity arises, as well as her past marriages, but Reg comes to understand that all that is past. In the meantime, Wilf and Cissy convince Cedric that bringing together those who sang the quartet on the famous recording to sing it again for the Verdi Gala concert will sell enough tickets to save the home. Enchanted with the idea, they persuade Reg to overcome his objections to performing with Jean again. However, she is harder to persuade as she vowed never to sing again after retiring. Cissy takes Jean flowers from the garden to cheer her up, and asks if she wishes to discuss the quartet, but Jean becomes violent and attacks Cissy, which only aggravates Cissys already delicate senile condition. Jean apologises and is finally persuaded to sing in the quartet from Rigoletto, after learning that Anne Langley will be singing Vissi darte from Tosca. The group prepares for their performance and, moments before their curtain call, Cissy gets very confused and attempts to walk out the door, saying that she has to go back to her family, but Jean manages to salvage the situation.

He experiments with his new abilities by shoplifting a piece of fruit through a grocery stores solid window. Scott also notices a diamond necklace on display in a nearby jewelry store window, but decides against stealing it. When he sees a bank, however, his face breaks into a sly grin. The police wonder about a bizarre crime. More than 50,000 was stolen from the bank with no sign of forced entry, nor any video footage of the crime. Strangely, a 1000 bill was found protruding from a solid piece of tempered steel. Tony realizes that Scott is abusing his power and tries to convince the police. Scott starts using his newlyfound power to acquire all the things he felt he was denied: money, recognition, power, and women. Scott confronts Carson, revealing the experiment, then taking his revenge for the life drained from me by literally draining Carsons life force. Scott then proceeds to a sleazy bar, where he gets some street toughs to back down. With his new found bravado, combined with his illgotten money, he tries to impress a bar girl. When they later kiss, Scott does not kill her, but drains her life force to the point where she has aged badly. The police have to find a way to stop a man who is unstoppable. Looking very old now, Tony returns to the lab, but they are unable to stop him. Scotts former girlfriend catches him in solid form and shoots and wounds him. Bleeding and feeling betrayed, Scott maniacally proclaims his invincibility and defiantly phaseshifts his body with difficulty through a wall embedded with supposedly impenetrable Cargonite. The End appears on screen, followed a moment later by a question mark. This interrogative statement leaves in question whether the aged Scott died or survived.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

U.S. Marine Corps Major Geoffrey Caton departs Pearl Harbor naval base in Hawaii aboard the Pan American Clipper to take over command on Wake Island.

He has them dig a large slit trench by hand. McClosky has a construction contract for large trenches and living quarters, and drives his crew to complete the work on time. There are numerous conflicts between the military and the civilians, including practicing for air raids. The next day is Sunday, December 7th, 1941. Randall prepares to board the Clipper, as he is leaving the service. Then news arrives about the Japanese air attack on Pearl Harbor. The island goes on alert. Randall is unsure what to do. He is sent to a bomb shelter with the civilians as enemy planes approach. The Americans have only four fighters in the air, holding eight in reserve, against 24 Japanese bombers. Marine flyers shoot down several Japanese planes, but the bombers inflict heavy damage. Following the raid, Caton tells Randall he is no longer a civilian. McClosky decides to stay and dig trenches and other shelters with his heavy equipment. That night, Caton informs pilot Lieutenant Bruce Cameron that his wife was killed at Pearl Harbor. The next day, enemy ships approach. The Marines camouflage their equipment. Caton orders his men into shelters and to hold their fire while the Japanese bombard the island. The Japanese signal the Americans to surrender. Caton does not answer. He waits until the enemy ships have closed to 4700 yards before returning fire, repelling the landing attempt and sinking several ships. Cameron, on a reconnaissance flight, spots a Japanese heavy cruiser which can hit the island while remaining out of range of the defenders weapons. He states he can take out that ship if his fighter is stripped down and carries only 15 gallons of fuel and a double load of bombs. Caton approves the mission. After successfully bombing the ship, Cameron is wounded by a Japanese fighter. He manages to land his airplane safely before dying. Japanese planes bomb the island repeatedly. Caton asks Captain Lewis to board a Navy patrol plane that is coming in, since he could provide intelligence to the U.S. Navy Department in Honolulu. Lewis refuses, but Caton orders him to go and file his official report. Later, Caton is informed that the largestcaliber ammunition is running out, so he has smaller guns spread around, and repositions his available men. Japanese planes approach in large numbers, causing major damage and inflicting numerous casualties. Only one pilot is left, Captain Patrick. When his plane is damaged, he bails out, but is killed while parachuting down. The Japanese again signal for surrender. Caton replies, Come and get us.

Doing research at the library, he learns that Brazil has no extradition treaty with the United States. If he steals the money at close of business on a Friday, he will have time to travel to Brazil before the theft is even discovered. But the season when the bank opens on Saturdays is about to begin, so he must take action the same week or else wait for months. He tells his wife Laurie Teresa Wright that the bank is sending him to Rio de Janeiro on business and he wants her and their daughter to travel with him. It is a great opportunity for his career, he says, and he has been given it in preference to the person who would normally be sent, so he cautions her not to talk to anyone about it. Laurie is delighted with the news, but insists their daughter stay at home with Lauries mother. Jim decides he can send for her after Laurie knows they are staying in Rio. With his inside knowledge and trusted position, the theft from the bank vault is simple enough, but the travel logistics are difficult. Flights are full, passports and visas are needed on a rush basis, and the Osbornes face a series of delays and miss a connection at New Orleans. At this point an airline employee, made suspicious by Jims urgent manner and very heavy baggage, tips off a customs officer to check whether he is illegally exporting gold, and the money is revealed. Unreported large cash transactions are legal in 1952, but the customs man knows it is not at all normal for a bank to send only a single employee with so much cash. Though he suspects some wrongdoing, he cannot reach Jims boss by telephone before the Osbornes flight is called, and there is no customs violation, so he lets them go. However, they are on standby and the flight is already full. They will not be able to reach Rio on Sunday. Now fearing arrest, Jim checks into a hotel using a false name. Laurie overhears this, realizes the truth, and confronts him. When he admits what he has done, she wants no part in it; she flies back to Los Angeles. Within hours Jim realizes that his wife and daughter are far more important to him than his dreams of wealth. Fortunately, it may still be possible to save the situation. Laurie was too upset to tell anyone why she had suddenly returned, and Jim has used his own money for their travel expenses, so the banks money is intact.

A young man, Philip is left with his godfather Nick Kendall, and learns through correspondence that Ambrose has met his widowed cousin Rachel in Florence, and they have wed. The Kendalls express surprise that Ambrose has become interested in women, though Philip found the absence of female companionship natural. Later, Ambrose begins sending letters indicating distrust of the medical care he is receiving in Florence. Concerned, Philip travels to Italy, only to be informed Ambrose has died and Rachel has left. Though Ambroses will left the entire estate to Philip pending his next birthday, Philip is convinced Rachel is guilty of murder and threatens her friend Rinaldi with revenge. Philip returns to Cornwall, and later learns Rachel has followed. She arrives at the estate, and while he vows to confront her, he meets her in the boudoir and is infatuated by the older womans beauty as they share tea. They accompany each other on riding excursions, and no longer suspecting her of foul play, he throws an accusatory letter on a campfire. The two cousins conflict over Rachels intentions to return to Florence and live independently, but Rachel indicates she is not angry with him, and they kiss. Rachel also reveals Ambrose had lost hope for her after a miscarriage. She stays for Christmas celebrations, when Nick receives bank information that she has drastically overdrawn her accounts. Nick warns Philip that Rachel was notorious in Florence for extravagance and lust. Despite this, Philip intends to turn over much of the estates wealth to Rachel, as soon as he can legally dispose of it on his next birthday. The day arrives, and when Rachel realizes what he has done for her, she expresses gratitude. While out in nature, the two have sex. At a dinner with friends, Philip declares he and Rachel are engaged, but Rachel accuses him of madness. In private, she tells him she was merely thankful to him, but she was not bought and is not ashamed of having sex. This leads to a struggle, after which Rachel professes fear of him. Sometime after, Philip falls ill. As he recovers, he is suspicious of Rachel, and watches her as she leaves on horseback. He and Nicks daughter Louise begin searching through Rachels belongings for any incriminating evidence, only to find out she apparently is innocent of an affair and the poisoning attempts Philip blames on her.

He returns to China after the war and takes on the identity of Qi Tianyuan, a comrade who was killed in action when a sniper hits him. Back in Shanghai, Chen joins an underground resistance movement to stop the Empire of Japan from invading China. He befriends Liu Yutian, the owner of a nightclub frequented by foreign dignitaries. He becomes attracted to Kiki, a nightclub singer who is actually a Japanese undercover agent named Captain Yamaguchi Yumi. One night, Chen discovers that the Japanese are planning to assassinate General Zeng, the son of a northern warlord, and push the blame to General Zhuo, a rival warlord. Zengs death will spark off a civil war between the two warlords and aid the subsequent Japanese invasion. Chen disguises himself as a masked superhero and defeats the assassins and saves Zeng. With the operation failed, Tokyo sends a name list of antiJapanese activists to Colonel Chikaraishi Takeshi, the leader of the Japanese secret agency in Shanghai, ordering him to kill the people on the list. Chikaraishi leaks out the list, causing panic among the populace, and pays a visit to the nightclub. Chikaraishi is aware of Chens true identity and he challenges Chen to save the people on the list. Chen and Chikaraishi engage in a race of time to save and assassinate the activists respectively. Some are killed while others managed to escape from Shanghai. Eventually, Chikaraishis younger brother Sasaki leads a team of assassins to murder the editor of the Shanghai Times. Chen kills Sasaki, but fails to save the editor in time. In the meantime, Chen figures out that Kiki is a spy and warns her to leave. Chikaraishi starts to distrust Kiki and forces her to kill General Zengs girlfriend, one of her close friends.

Opal describes the preacher as a turtle, always sticking his head into his turtle shell, and never wanting to come out into the real world. This is most likely because of how sad he is about her mother, with whom he is still in love. One of the people Opal meets is Miss Franny Block, a kind and somewhat eccentric elder librarian, who tells her many great stories, including one involving a bear. Opal also meets Gloria Dump, a blind recovering alcoholic with a tree in her backyard that has beer bottles hanging from it. She calls it amistake tree and the bottles represent the ghosts of all the things she has done wrong. One day, fed up with WinnDixie, the landlord of the Bulonis trailer park, Mr. Alfred, orders the preacher to get rid of the dog. The preacher calls the animal pound to take WinnDixie away, but Opal begs her father to keep her dog. Unable to see his daughter this upset, the preacher tells the pound to return WinnDixie, claiming that he is not the same dog he called about. Opal gets a job at Gertrudes Pets and befriends a worker there, Otis, a shy exconvict with a passion for music. She also meets a girl named Sweetie Pie Thomas, who is eager to get a dog like WinnDixie. Later, a thunderstorm comes and WinnDixie, being pathologically afraid of thunderstorms, runs away. While Opal looks for him, her father wants to give up and she blames him for the loss of her mother and WinnDixie running away. But her father explains that he tried very hard to look for her mother. He then admits that he believes that she is never coming back. Later they go back to a party and Otis starts to sing a song on his guitar. WinnDixie is heard outside howling along to the song. Everyone, while singing, lets him in and welcomes him back.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

He is told that a regiment of 30 men had gone to Confederate Fort Pulaski to seize it from the Confederates and only one man returned barely alive.

Ham is uninterested in the mission, but he is launched into space despite his best efforts to escape the scientists training facility. The three chimps enter the wormhole, where Titan and Luna pass out from the pressure, leaving Ham with the task of getting the ship out and landing it. This is done, and Ham and Luna explore the planet, during which their ship, along with Titan, is taken by a group of aliens sent by Zartog. Ham and Luna begin their journey to Zartogs palace, and on the way they meet one of the inhabitants, known to them as Kilowatt. Kilowatt offers to lead them to the palace, but soon after they encounter a flesh eating monster in a cave. The monster blocks the exit, but Kilowatt distracts it, sacrificing herself so Ham and Luna can escape. The two chimps finally reach the palace, where they discover that Titan has been teaching Zartog some of the probes features. They rescue him and are able to board their ship, but just as they are about to leave, Ham glances outside and sees Zartog torturing some of the other aliens. He then tells Titan and Luna that they indirectly sent the probe there, and that they owe it to Kilowatt to help save the planet. The three of them exit the ship, which blasts off set to autopilot, but as they are trying to think of a plan, Zartog attacks them with the probe. Just as they are about to get destroyed, Titan tricks Zartog into triggering an ejection mechanism in the probe, which in turn leads to his defeat. The chimps then discover that Kilowatt has survived, and they are able to make contact with Comet and Houston back on Earth through a walkietalkie. Houston reminds them that if they can redesign the probe, then they can use it to get back to Earth. They manage to do this with help from the planets inhabitants and they use an erupting volcano to get the thrust they need to escape the planets gravity. They go into space, and just as they are about to reenter the wormhole, Titan hands the controls over to Ham, since Ham is the only one who can withstand the pressure, and thus, the only one who can pilot the ship home. Titan and Luna once again pass out. Ham is unsure if he is up to the task until he has a mental conversation with his grandfather, who tells him to believe in himself and to just do things his Hams way. Ham manages to manoeuver the ship back to Earth and land it with Lunas help, and the Senator, under pressure from the press, decides to dramatically increase the space programs funding. The film ends with a celebration being held for the chimps return.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

Carlito vows to be through with his criminal activities but is persuaded to accompany his young cousin Guajiro John Ortiz to a drug deal held at a bar. Guajiro is betrayed and killed by his suppliers and Carlito is forced to shoot his way out. Afterwards, Carlito takes Guajiros 30,000 from the botched deal and uses it to buy into a nightclub owned by a gambling addict named Saso Jorge Porcel with the intent on saving 75,000 to retire to the Caribbean. As nightclub coowner, Carlito declines several offers for a business partnership with a hotheaded young gangster from the Bronx named Benny Blanco John Leguizamo. Carlito also rekindles his romance with his former girlfriend Gail Penelope Ann Miller, a ballet dancer who moonlights as a stripper. Kleinfeld develops a love interest with Bennys girlfriend, Steffie, a waitress at the club. Bennys frustration with Carlitos constant rejections boils over and he confronts Carlito one night at his table. Carlito publicly humiliates Benny, who reacts by manhandling Steffie. Fueled by his nowextensive use of alcohol and cocaine, Kleinfeld brazenly pulls out a gun and threatens to kill Benny, but Carlito intervenes. Despite being personally threatened by Benny himself, Carlito lets Benny go unharmed; a decision which alienates Carlitos gangster friend and personal bodyguard Pachanga Luis Guzman. Kleinfeld, who stole 1 million in payoff money from his Italian mobboss client, Anthony Tony T Taglialucci, is coerced into providing his yacht to help Tony T break out of the Rikers Island prison barge. Kleinfeld begs for Carlitos assistance in the prison break, and Carlito reluctantly agrees. Under cover of night, Carlito, Kleinfeld, and Tony Ts son, Frankie, sail to a floating buoy outside of the barge where Tony T is waiting. As they pull Tony T aboard, Kleinfeld unexpectedly kills him and Frankie and dumps both of their bodies in the East River. Carlito immediately severs his ties with Kleinfeld and decides to leave town with Gail. The next day, Kleinfeld barely survives a retaliatory assassination attempt when hes stabbed in the chest at his office by two mobsters. Carlito is apprehended by police and taken to the office of District Attorney Norwalk James Rebhorn, where he is played a tape of Kleinfeld offering to testify to false criminal allegations against Carlito. Norwalk advises that he is aware of Carlito as an accomplice to the Taglialucci murders in an attempt to leverage him into betraying Kleinfeld to save himself, but Carlito refuses. Carlito visits Kleinfeld under police protection in the hospital, where he confesses to selling him out. Having noticed a suspicious man dressed in a police uniform waiting in the lobby, Carlito deftly unloads Kleinfelds revolver and parts ways with him. The man turns out to be Tony Ts other son, Vinnie Joseph Siravo, seeking vengeance for his brother and father. Vinnie sneaks into Kleinfelds room and executes him without incident because of Kleinfelds empty gun. Carlito buys train tickets to Miami for himself and Gail, now pregnant. When he stops by his club to get the stashed money, Carlito is met by a group of mobsters led by Vinnie. The Italians plan on killing Carlito, but he manages to slip out through a secret exit. The Italians pursue him throughout the citys subway system and into Grand Central Terminal, where they engage in a gunfight. Carlito kills all of his pursuers except Vinnie, who is shot and killed by police attracted by the gunfire. As Carlito runs to catch the train where Gail and Pachanga are waiting for him, he is ambushed by a disguised Benny, who shoots Carlito several times in the abdomen with a silenced gun. Pachanga admits to the dying Carlito that he is now working for Benny, only to be shot as well. Carlito hands a tearful Gail the money and tells her to escape with their unborn child and start a new life elsewhere. As he is wheeled away on a gurney, Carlito stares at a billboard with a Caribbean beach and a picture of a woman. The billboard then comes to life in his mind, and the woman, who is clearly Gail, starts dancing as Carlito slowly dies.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

Sohail bemusedly sighs as the others, once past the fence, are blown up by the landmines. Kaul and the remaining prisoners are again beaten and kicked back into their barracks. One of the prisoners, Khan, manages to evade the landmines and escapes. Gaurav brings him to safety. Gaurav attacks a military courier and, using his uniforms, infiltrates a Pakistan Army office block. He steals a set of plans which reveal a water main under the prison. His father and the men can dig their way to this main and crawl out. With great reluctance Khan gets arrested again. Sohail correctly guesses that Khan is back for a reason. Khan discloses to Kaul that his son is here; this news, and the water main, is a great inspiration for the men. The men quietly begin digging a tunnel to the water main. They discover the body of an Indian Army Captain Jatin in the debris under the prison, but this Jatin is among them! Khan and Kaul discover that he is in fact a Pakistani spy. Gaurav and Khan had planned the escape for the night of the tenth and Jatin, the spy, had dutifully reported this back to Sohail. Kaul and Khan decide that the escape will happen on the ninth. Jatin is not told of this but the men manage to send a coded message to Gaurav. The following day Khan notices the number 9 scrawled on an army supply truck entering the prison: it is Gaurav\u2019s reply. He will await the men near the water main outlet on the ninth. On the night of the escape the men overpower the guards and kill Jatin. They enter the water main and begin digging away the last few meters of remaining debris. The knocking in the pipes travels up to Sohail\u2019s kitchen sink; Sohail quickly discovers the escape and hotly pursues the men down the pipe. Gaurav digs from the other side and, just in the nick of time, the debris is cleared and father and son are reunited. The men make it through. One of them sacrifices himself on a land mine inside the water main which caves in and blocks Sohail. Gaurav leads his father and the men to a railway line but the train is delayed. The men split up to avoid detection and arrange to meet at dawn near a border point. They arrive at the border point but Sohail and his men are in close pursuit. There is a firefight. Khan puts up a brave fight but is shot down. Ranvir Kaul and Gaurav and the handful of remaining prisoners finally get across the border in a Pakistan army truck. Sohail is right behind them but his jeep is disarmed and he is surrounded by Kaul and the prisoners. Kaul points to the border line behind them; they are now on Indian soil. Kaul, now an Indian Army soldier, attacks and kills Sohail in hand to hand combat, and throws his body across the border. The film ends as Ranvir Kaul and his men are reinstated in the Indian Army and salute the Indian tricolor.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

In particular, the pathogens supplied by the Lucas Clinics exclusive celebrity Hannah Geist Sarah Gadon are extremely popular, and another employee at the clinic, Derek Lessing Reid Morgan, is responsible for harvesting them from Hannah directly. To make extra money, Syd uses his own body as an incubator, steals pathogens from the lab, and sells them on the black market. To do so, he uses a stolen console to break the copy protection placed on the virus by the clinic; once injected in a client, the pathogen is rendered incommunicable. He then passes the pathogens to Arvid Joe Pingue, who works at Astral Bodies, a celebrity meat market where meat is grown from the cells of celebrities for consumption. After Derek is caught smuggling and arrested, Lucas asks Syd to take his place and harvest a pathogen from Hannah, who has recently fallen ill. Once he has taken a blood sample from Hannah, Syd quickly injects himself with some of her blood. He experiences the first symptoms, fever and disorientation, rapidly, and he leaves work early. His attempts to remove the virus copy protection are unsuccessful, and the console is destroyed during the process. When Syd awakens from severe delirium the next day, he discovers Hannah has died from the unknown disease, and all products harvested from her have skyrocketed in popularity. Desperate to fix his console, he approaches Arvid, who sets up a meeting with Levine, the leader of the piracy group. Levine offers to fix the console in exchange for samples of Syds blood, but Syd refuses. Levine subdues him and forcibly takes samples from Syd, as the pathogen which killed Hannah is now hotly in demand on the black market, and lethal pathogens are not legal to distribute. The next day, a severely ill Syd is approached by two men, who drive him to an undisclosed location where Hannah is actually still alive. Syd learns from Hannahs physician Dr. Abendroth that the virus infecting them both has been intentionally engineered with a security measure to prevent analysis, which explains why Syds console was destroyed. Hannahs death was fabricated to protect her, but she is shown to be in the extreme stages of the illness, extremely weak and bleeding from her mouth. Dr. Abendroth reveals to Syd that the virus is a modified version of an illness that Hannah has had before, and that he himself has an infatuation with her, having had samples of her skin grafted to his own arm. He further suggests that since Syd unnecessarily injected himself with Hannahs blood, he too is just another fan. As Syds condition worsens, he returns to the Lucas Clinic, where he traces the original strain of the virus to Derek, who sold it to a rival company, Vole  Tesser. Dr Abendroth discovers that Vole  Tesser patented the modified strain, though their motives remain unclear. Before Syd can proceed further, he is abducted by Levine and incarcerated in a room where his deterioration and death will be broadcast on reality television to sate Hannahs fans, who could not witness her death. As Syd begins to show the final symptoms, he escapes by spearing Levine in the mouth with a syringe and holding a nurse hostage with his infected blood. After Syd realizes that Vole  Tesser infected Hannah to harvest their own patented pathogen from her, Syd contacts Tesser and negotiates a deal. The film closes with a virtualreality version of Hannah that advertises her Afterlife exclusively from Vole  Tesser. Syd is shown working for Vole  Tesser, where Hannahs cells have been replicated to form a distorted cell garden from Astral Bodies celebrity meat technology. Viruses injected into her system are sold. Syd demonstrates a new virus as he sticks a needle into a genetically created arm. Later, while alone, Syd cuts the arm and drinks the flowing blood; it is revealed the arm is in fact Hannahs, as her deformed face and body are shown to be in the Cell Garden chamber.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

Professor Abronsius, formerly of the University of Konigsberg and his apprentice Alfred are on the hunt for vampires. Abronsius is old and withering and barely able to survive the cold ride through the wintry forests, while Alfred is bumbling and introverted. The two hunters come to a small village seemingly at the end of a long search for signs of vampires. The two stay at a local inn full of angstridden townspeople who perform strange rituals to fend off an unseen evil. While staying at the inn, Alfred develops a fondness for Sarah, the overprotected daughter of the tavern keeper Yoine Shagal. Alfred witnesses Sarah being kidnapped by the local vampire lord Count von Krolock. Crazed with grief and armed only with a bunch of garlic, Shagal attempts to rescue her but doesnt get very far before hes captured, drained of his blood and vampirised. After Shagal rises and attacks Magda, the taverns beautiful maidservant and the object of his lust while he was still human, Abronsius and Alfred follow his trail in the snow, which leads them to Krolocks ominous castle in the snowblanketed hills nearby. They break into the castle but are trapped by the Counts hunchback servant, Koukol. They are taken to see the count, who affects an air of aristocratic dignity while questioning Abronsius about why he has come to the castle. They also encounter the Counts son, the foppish and homosexual Herbert. Meanwhile, Shagal, no longer caring about his daughters fate, sets up his plan to turn Magda into his vampire bride. Despite misgivings, Abronsius and Alfred accept the Counts invitation to stay in his ramshackle Gothic castle, where Alfred spends the night fitfully. The next morning, Abronsius plans to find the castle crypt and destroy the Count by staking him in the heart, seemingly forgetting about the fate of Sarah. The crypt is guarded by the hunchback, so after some wandering they attempt to climb in through a roof window. However, Abronsius gets stuck in the aperture, and it falls to Alfred to complete the task of killing the Count in his slumber. At the last moment his nerve fails him and he cannot accomplish the deed. Alfred then has to go back outside to free Abronsius, but on the way he comes upon Sarah having a bath in her room. She seems oblivious to her danger when he pleads for her to come away with him, and informs him that a ball is to take place this very night. After briefly taking his eyes off her, Alfred turns to find Sarah has vanished into thin air. After freeing Abronsius, who is half frozen, they reenter the castle. Alfred again seeks Sarah but meets Herbert instead, who first attempts to seduce him, and then, after Alfred realizes that Herberts reflection does not show up in the mirror, reveals his vampire nature and attempts to bite him. Abronsius and Alfred flee from Herbert through a dark stairway to safety, only to be trapped behind a locked door in a turret. As night is falling, they become horrified witnesses as the graves below open up to reveal a huge number of vampires at the castle, who hibernate and meet once a year only to feast upon any captives the Count has provided for them. The Count appears, mocking them and tells them their fate is sealed. He leaves them to attend the ball, where Sarah will be presented as the next vampire victim. The hunters escape by firing a cannon at the door  substituting steam pressure for gunpowder  and come to the ball in disguise, where, although exposed by their reflections in a huge mirror, they are able to grab Sarah and escape. Fleeing in a horsedrawn sleigh, Abronsius and Alfred are unaware that it is now too late for Sarah, who awakens in midflight as a vampire and bites Alfred, thus allowing vampires to be released into the world.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

Before the night begins, James hands Wallace a pair of Ambassador cigars, promising to fire them up before midnight in celebration of Wallys birthday. Wallace answers a phone call intended for a hitman at the same payphone that the Theatre of Life uses for its act. The contact, Sir Roger Daggenhurst Richard Wilson, mistakes Wallace for Spencer, the hitman he has hired and Wallace assumes the identity. The real Spencer Terry ONeill picks up the phone call meant for Wallace and murders one of the actors, prompting a police investigation. Daggenhurst, his assistant Hawkins Simon Chandler, British Defense Minister Gilbert Embleton John Standing, and Russian intelligence agent Sergei Nicholas Woodeson plan to detonate an explosive device hidden in a Matryoshka doll during a dinner between British and Russian dignitaries, to rekindle the Cold War and replace their aging technology.

Even though the medical examiner concludes that the drunken man died from a heart attack, Alex is riddled with guilt and confesses to have murdered the man. Ashamed of what he has done, he breaks off the engagement to his girlfriend and assistant, Maura Daniel Ankers. George Keene Milburn Stone, who is Alexs manager, arranges for him to work for an old friend, Mme Valerie Monet Tala Birell. She is the owner of a wax museum and Alex is hired as a lecturer.

Arguments ensue, ending with Valerie fainting and Alex leaving in anger. Following a nights sleep, Alex returns to find that Valerie has disappeared. Police Inspector Brant Douglass Dumbrille suspects that Valerie has been murdered, believing Alex to be the last person to have seen Valerie alive. All are unaware that Rudi has found Valerie in a coma and hidden her away among his unfinished wax sculptures. Nina suspects Alex of scheming with the crazy surgeon to be rid of Valerie. What they dont know is that Rudi has planned to get Alex committed as mentally ill, and the mastermind of this ingenious plan is none other than Alexs manager, George. The reason is to gain control over Alexs property. Rudi manages to make Nina fall into a coma and hides her body in the same manner as was done with Valerie.

The woman who was driving the car, Alba Bewick Andrea Ferreol, is not killed, but has a leg amputated. Venus de Milo Frances Barber, a woman associated with the zoo, attempts to forge a relationship with the twins, ostensibly to help them recover from their loss. Meanwhile, Oswald and Oliver gradually become obsessed with images of growth and decay, watching videos on the origins of life and creating timelapse video of decomposing life forms. They begin this latter task with a green apple, bitten into and rotting before their camera lens. The twins descent sees them become romantically involved with Alba, and increasingly attached to one another. Venus de Milo remains involved with them enough to observe their obsessions grow: they take to videotaping the decomposition of prawns, and they take a personal interest in Albas childhood, going so far as to ask her to show them a field seen in a photograph on her bedside table. They become obsessed with snails, and they take advantage of their contacts at the zoo to create decomposition videos of more and more complex animals, moving gradually up the food chain. Excerpts from Sir David Attenboroughs TV series Life on Earth, including his narration, are featured in the film. Alba becomes a subject for the experiments of her surgeon, who eventually amputates her other leg, claiming it is putting stress on her spine. His true motive is to fashion Alba into a subject of his recreations of Johannes Vermeer paintings; Venus de Milo participates in this process, as well. Ultimately, the Deuce brothers obsession with decay leads them to the top of the food chain, and to a complex lifeanddeath negotiation with Alba herself. The brothers project seems the only possible emotional investment for either of them, so Alba offers herself as the final specimen to be photographed in its decay. However her family intervenes before the brothers can claim her, so they are forced to find another way to create their final timelapse video. They do so by returning to the field of Albas childhood and setting up the necessary equipment to facilitate and capture their own decomposition. However a huge infestation of snails covers the equipment and bodies, and finally shorts out the electrical system, halting their grand project.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

Unloved and neglected by her late parents, who were killed in an earthquake, she is a cold, unpleasant girl, unhappy in her new surroundings. Head housekeeper Mrs. Medlock informs Mary she will not be spoiled as she was in India and that her uncle, who spends extended periods of time away from the Manor, will likely not see her. Mary is ordered not to leave her room, but strange noises lead her to explore the mansion on her own. Mrs. Medlock eventually allows her to play outside to keep her from poking about the house. In the expansive grounds of the Manor, Mary discovers her late aunts garden, which was locked and neglected since her accidental death ten years prior. Martha Sowerby, a maid, and her brother, Dickon, a natureloving boy who can talk to animals, befriend Mary. Fascinated by the secret garden, Mary enlists Dickon to help her bring it back to life, gradually becoming a more friendly, happy child in the process. When finally introduced to her uncle, Mary is apprehensive, knowing he was responsible for locking up the secret garden. Fearful he would do it again, Mary evasively asks to plant seeds in an unwanted part of the Manor, to which Lord Craven grants permission before leaving the country for the rest of the year. Confident that the garden will remain a secret, Mary and Dickon continue their work. Hidden away in the gloomy mansion is Marys cousin, Colin, who has been treated all his life like a fragile, sickly invalid. This has turned him into a demanding, short tempered, helpless boy who has never left his room or learned to walk. Mary eventually discovers Colin and learns the strange noises she has been hearing is him crying. She is taken aback by his difficult nature, but reaches out to him anyway. She shows him that hes not actually sick, and that the outside world is not as dangerous as Mrs. Medlock, who is in charge of caring for him, claims. Encouraged by Mary, Colin decides to go outside for the first time in his life. Mary and Dickon take him to the secret garden and Colin begins his own healing process. Colin, Mary, and Dickon spend all of their time in the garden, where Colin learns to both stand and walk on his own.

The proprietor, Leland Gaunt, is a charming elderly gentleman who always seems to have an item in stock that is perfectly suited to any customer who comes through his door. The prices are surprisingly low, considering the merchandise \u2013 such as a rare Sandy Koufax baseball card, a carnival glass lampshade, and a fragment of wood believed to be from Noahs Ark \u2013 but he expects each customer also to play a little prank on someone else in Castle Rock. Gaunt knows about the longstanding private grudges, arguments, and feuds between the various townspeople, and the pranks are his means of forcing them to escalate until the whole town is eventually caught up in madness and violence. Sheriff Alan Pangborn becomes wary of Gaunt as soon as the shop opens. However, his lover, Polly Chalmers, dismisses his suspicions and buys an ancient charm that relieves the arthritis pain in her hands. Tensions rapidly grow after Nettie Cobb, Pollys housekeeper, and her enemy Wilma Jerzyck kill each other in a confrontation sparked by pranks played on them by others. Many other rivalries begin to fester, spurred by the personal motives of the people involved drugs, secret pedophilia, bad business dealings, religious disagreements, etc.. Gaunt eventually hires petty criminal John Ace Merrill as his assistant, providing him with highquality cocaine and hinting at buried treasure that could relieve the debt he owes to a pair of drug dealers. Aces first assignment is to retrieve crates of pistols, ammunition, and blasting caps from a garage in Boston; Gaunt soon begins to sell the pistols to his customers so they can protect their property. For centuries, he has tricked unsuspecting people into buying worthless junk that appears to be whatever they treasure most. They become so paranoid about keeping their items safe that they eagerly buy up the weapons that he inevitably offers and trade away their souls. Ace begins to suspect the supernatural background of his new employer, but Gaunt keeps him in line through intimidation and promises of revenge against Alan and the town. With the violence in Castle Rock rapidly escalating, Ace and the towns head selectman Danforth Buster Keeton who has embezzled thousands of dollars from public funds plant dynamite all over town, using the caps Ace brought back. Alan sets out to kill Ace, wrongly believing him to be responsible for a car accident that killed his wife and son, and Polly realizes the evil of the charm she bought and destroys it. As the dynamite bombs explode, Keeton is wounded by one of Alans deputies and is put out of his misery by Ace. Taking Polly hostage, Ace demands that Alan hand over a hoard of cash he allegedly stole from one of the sites Ace dug up. The deputy kills Ace, leaving Alan to face off against Gaunt. Using sleight of hand and magic novelties that suddenly come to life, Alan forces Gaunt back and grabs his valise, which contains the souls of his customers. Gaunt flees the scene, his car turning into a horsedrawn wagon, and the survivors are left to ponder an uncertain future. The novel ends as it begins, with a firstperson narrative indicating that a new and mysterious shop called Answered Prayers is about to open in a small Iowa town \u2013 an implication that Gaunt is ready to begin his business cycle all over again.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

Her speech eventually inspires the insecure Melanie Tolman Yvette Mimieux to lose her virginity soon after the young women arrive in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.

Marys Protestant halfsister, Elizabeth, under house arrest for conspiracy charges, is freed and crowned the Queen of England. As briefed by her adviser William Cecil, Elizabeth inherits a distressed England besieged by debts, crumbling infrastructure, hostile neighbours and treasonous nobles within her administration, chief among them the Duke of Norfolk. Cecil advises Elizabeth to marry, produce an heir, and secure her rule. Unimpressed with her suitors, Elizabeth delays her decision and continues her secret affair with Lord Robert Dudley while Cecil appoints Francis Walsingham, a Protestant exile returned from France, to act as Elizabeths bodyguard and adviser. Mary of Guise lands an additional 4,000 French troops in neighbouring Scotland. Unfamiliar with military strategy and browbeaten by Norfolk at the war council, Elizabeth orders a military response, which proves disastrous when the younger, illtrained English forces are defeated by the professional French soldiers. Walsingham tells Elizabeth that Catholic lords and priests intentionally deprived Elizabeths army of proper soldiers and used their defeat to argue for Elizabeths removal. Realizing the depth of the conspiracy against her and her dwindling options, Elizabeth accepts Mary of Guises conditions, to consider marrying her nephew Henry of France. To stabilize her rule and heal Englands religious divisions, Elizabeth proposes the Act of Uniformity, which unites English Christians under the Church of England and severs their connection to the Vatican. In response to the Acts passage, the Vatican sends a priest to England to aid Norfolk and his cohorts in their growing plot to overthrow Elizabeth. Unaware of the plot, Elizabeth meets Henry of France but ignores his advances in favour of Lord Robert. William Cecil confronts Elizabeth over her indecisiveness about marrying and reveals Lord Robert is married to another woman. Elizabeth rejects Henrys marriage proposal when she discovers he is a crossdresser and confronts Lord Robert about his secrets, fracturing their idyllic affair and banishing him from her private residence. Elizabeth survives an assassination attempt, whose evidence implicates Mary of Guise. Elizabeth sends Walsingham to secretly meet with Mary in Scotland, under the guise of once again planning to marry Henry. Instead, Walsingham assassinates Guise, inciting French enmity against Elizabeth. When William Cecil orders her to solidify relations with the Spanish, Elizabeth dismisses him from her service, choosing instead to follow her own counsel. Walsingham warns of another plot to kill Elizabeth spearheaded by the priest from Rome carrying letters of conspiracy. Under Elizabeths orders, Walsingham apprehends the priest who divulges the names of the conspirators and a Vatican agreement to elevate Norfolk to the English crown if he weds Mary, Queen of Scots. Walsingham arrests Norfolk and executes him and every conspirator except Lord Robert. Elizabeth grants Lord Robert his life as a reminder to herself to never be blinded by romance again.

The leader of the independence faction is the abrasive John Adams of Massachusetts, whose continuous pushing of the issue has brought their cause to a complete standstill. John Dickinson of Pennsylvania leads the opposition that hopes for reconciliation with England. During his quieter moments, Adams calls up the image of his wife Abigail Adams, who resides in Massachusetts and gives him insight and encouragement these conversations are based on letters between the couple. Dr. Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania suggests another colony that supports independence should submit a proposal. Richard Henry Lee of Virginia voluntarily rides off to Williamsburg, Virginia to get authorization from the Virginia Colony to propose independence. Dr. Lyman Hall arrives to represent Georgia, and immediately, he is interrogated by his fellow delegates regarding his views on independence with Dickinson framing it as treason. Weeks later, Lee returns with the resolution, and debate on the question begins. However, in the midst of debate, Caesar Rodney falters because of his cancer and is taken back to Delaware by fellow delegate Thomas McKean, leaving the antiindependence George Read to represent Delaware. After heated discussions, the question is called without a majority of positive votes present. The New Jersey delegation, led by Reverend John Witherspoon, arrives just in time to provide a vote supporting independence. In a move intended to defeat the resolution, Dickinson calls for a vote requiring unanimity for passage. The vote ends in a tie between the colonies, New York abstaining as it does in every vote. It is ultimately decided in favor of unanimity by John Hancock, president of the Continental Congress, who argues that any objecting colony would fight for England against independence. Stalling for time to rally support for the resolution, Adams and Franklin call again for a postponement, justifying their call by stating the need for a declaration describing their grievances. Once again tied and ultimately decided by Hancock, the vote is successfully postponed until such a document can be written. Hancock appoints a committee that includes Adams, Franklin, Roger Sherman of Connecticut, Robert Livingston of New York, and Thomas Jefferson after Lee declines due to an appointment to serve as governor of Virginia. Jefferson resists because he desires to return home to Virginia to see his wife, Martha, but the others present more compelling reasons to avoid the responsibility; they opine that Jeffersons diplomatic nature and superior writing skill are required to draft the declaration. Jefferson develops writers block due to missing his wife, so Adams sends for Martha: It simply occurred to me that the sooner his problem was solved the sooner ours would be. Upon meeting her, Adams and Franklin are quite taken with Martha. While maneuvering to get the required unanimity for the vote on independence, Adams, Franklin and Samuel Chase of Maryland visit the Colonial Army encamped in New Brunswick, New Jersey, at the request of General Washington, to help convince Maryland. When they return to Philadelphia, the declaration is read and then subsequently debated and amended. Jefferson agrees to most alterations to the document, much to Adams growing consternation. The debate reaches a head when the Southern delegates, led by Edward Rutledge of South Carolina, walk out of Congress when a clause opposing slavery is not removed. Adams remains adamant that the clause remain, but Franklin appeals to him to allow the passage to be removed so that they can first achieve the vote on independence and the formation of a nation, deferring the slavery fight to a later time. Adams leaves the final decision to Jefferson, who reluctantly concedes. After removing that clause, 11 of 13 colonies are now in favor. New York abstains yet again since its delegates have never been given specific orders by the disorganized New York legislature. The question is therefore up to the Colony of Pennsylvania, whose delegation is polled at Franklins request. Franklin votes for the declaration, but Dickinson votes against. The outcome is now in the hands of their fellow Pennsylvanian Judge James Wilson. Wilson has always followed Dickinsons lead, but in this case Wilson votes in favor of the declaration, securing its passage, so that he would not be remembered by history as the man who voted to prevent American independence. After receiving word of the destruction of his property from General Washington, Lewis Morris finally withdraws New Yorks abstention and agrees to sign the document. Finally, with the Declaration of Independence ready to be signed, Hancock places his signature first, whereupon the others including New York affix theirs to the Declaration, establishing the United States on July 4, 1776.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

Edward Carruthers Marshall Thompson. He is suspected of having murdered the other nine members of his crew for their food and water rations, on the premise that he had no way of knowing if or when an Earth rescue mission would ever arrive. Carruthers denies this allegation, attributing his crews deaths to a hostile humanoid life form on the Red Planet. Commander Col. Van Heusen is unconvinced and makes sure that Carruthers is constantly accompanied by another member of his crew. While the ship was on the Martian surface, a large external exhaust had been left open, allowing the creature easy access. The crew are at first skeptical that something crawled aboard while they were on Mars. However, when Kienholz investigates odd sounds coming from a lower level, he is killed and his body hidden in an air duct. Next is Gino Finelli. He is found, barely alive, but the creature attacks his wouldbe rescuer. Bullets have no effect, forcing the crewman to leave Gino behind, much to the distress of his brother Bob. An autopsy of Kienholzs body reveals that it has been sucked dry of all fluids. The crew use hand grenades and gas grenades, but the creature proves immune to both. They next try electrocution, with no effect. When It is tricked into going into the spaceships atomic reactor room, they shut the heavily shielded door and expose the creature directly to the ships nuclear pile. It easily crashes through the door and escapes. The creature is so strong that it can tear through the metal hatches separating each of the ships levels. The survivors except for an injured crewman, who is trapped below in a spot inaccessible to the creature retreat to the control room on the topmost deck. When Carruthers notices the ships higherthannormal oxygen consumption rate, he surmises that this is due to the creatures larger lung capacity, needed for the thin Martian atmosphere. In a last desperate move, everyone puts on their spacesuits, and Carruthers opens the command decks hull airlock directly to the vacuum of space. A violent decompression follows, and the plan works: It suffocates and finally expires, stuck part way through the final hatch.

Hughie lives in the lodging house run by his aunt Dunning, along with a selection of boarders including a kindly elderly gent with a penchant for Biblebashing Wilfrid Brambell and a smoothtalking ladies man Howard Pays. Hughie is questioned by the police, but Superintendent Allen Barr releases him as there is no firm evidence against him. A few days later another girl is killed in the town, and the locals make up their minds that Hughie is responsible and launch a witchhunt against him. Believing the police are failing to do their job properly, they start issuing death threats against him after gathering in the pub to discuss the case, and the front window of the lodging house is put through by a large rock. Again, Allens instincts tell him that Hughie is basically a harmless if odd soul, and is not responsible for the killings. He starts to look more closely at other individuals connected to Hughie, in the belief that somebody is going out of their way to set him up. While the townsfolk continue their vendetta, Allen quietly observes and finds his attention focussed on a likely suspect. He shadows the individual as he walks the streets of the town one night and catches the guilty party almost in the act, narrowly saving another young woman from a murderous attack.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

Cole is selected to be trained and sent back in time to find the original virus in order to help scientists develop a cure. Meanwhile, Cole is troubled by recurring dreams involving a foot chase and shooting at an airport. Cole arrives in Baltimore in 1990, not 1996 as planned. He is arrested, then hospitalized in a mental hospital on the diagnosis of Dr. Kathryn Railly. There he encounters Jeffrey Goines, a mental patient with fanatical views. Cole is interviewed by a panel of doctors, and he tries to explain that the virus outbreak has already happened, and nobody can change it. After an escape attempt, Cole is sedated and locked in a cell, but disappears moments later, and wakes up back in 2035. He is interrogated by the scientists, who play a distorted voicemail message that asserts the association of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys with the virus. He is also shown photos of numerous people suspected of being involved, including Goines. The scientists offer Cole a second chance to complete his mission and send him back in time. He arrives at a battlefield during World War I, is shot in the leg, and then is suddenly transported to 1996. In 1996, Railly gives a lecture about the Cassandra complex to a group of scientists. At the postlecture book signing, Dr. Peters tells Railly that apocalypse alarmists represent the sane vision, while humanitys gradual destruction of the environment is the real lunacy. Cole arrives at the venue after seeing flyers publicizing it, and when Railly departs, he kidnaps her and forces her to take him to Philadelphia. They learn that Goines is the founder of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys, and set out in search of him. When they confront him, however, Goines denies any involvement with the group and says that in 1990 Cole originated the idea of wiping out humanity with a virus stolen from Goiness virologist father. About to be apprehended by police, Cole is transported back to 2035, where he reaffirms to the scientists his commitment to his mission. But when he finds Railly again in 1996, he tells her he now believes himself insane. Railly, meanwhile, has discovered evidence of his time travel, which she shows him. They decide to depart for the Florida Keys before the onset of the plague. On their way to the airport, they learn that the Army of the Twelve Monkeys was not the source of the epidemic; the groups major act of protest is releasing animals from a zoo and placing Goiness father in an animal cage. At the airport, Cole leaves a last message telling the scientists that in following the Army of the Twelve Monkeys they are on the wrong track, and that he will not return. He is soon confronted by Jose, an acquaintance from his own time, who gives Cole a handgun and ambiguously instructs him to follow orders. At the same time, Railly spots Dr. Peters, and recognizes him from a newspaper photograph as an assistant at Goiness fathers virology lab. Peters is about to embark on a tour of several cities that match the locations and sequence of the viral outbreaks. Cole forces his way through a security checkpoint in pursuit of Peters. After drawing the gun he was given, Cole is fatally shot by police.

Eye as a classified ads editor. Her boss, Eli, seems to give all of the men in her office the breaks, including her boyfriend Hank. When a woman is discovered dead on the sidewalk, halfburned into ashes in an apparent case of the spontaneous human combustion, Kim decides to pursue the story on her own without Elis approval. While investigating, she crosses paths with Fima, a used bookstore proprietor whose shop is in the building the woman jumped from. As a gift, Fima offers Kim a book on feminism and the occult. On Christmas Eve, Kim spends the evening with Hanks family, who recurrently make snide remarks about Kim being Jewish. Later at her apartment, Kim begins reading the book Fima gave to her, and finds a chapter on The Fire of Lilith depicting a woman engulfed in flames. The next day, Kim arrives at a picnic Fima invited her to, where she meets Katherine Harrison, a selfdescribed old crone, and the young Jane Yanana. They tell her about Lilith, Adams first wife and the spirit of all that crawls. At the Eye, Eli, instead of being angry about Kim missing work, lets her officially have the spontaneous combustion story. That afternoon, Kim decides to visit Fimas apartment to ask her more questions. Fima serves her a cup of tea, which makes Kim nauseated. Fima tells Kim of her daughter Lilith. Fima offers her a date and demands that Kim eat it. She does, even though it looks like a roach in her hand. Soon after, Kim passes out. She wakes up surrounded by Jane, Fima, Katherine, and Li. They perform a ritual on Kim: Ricky and Fima slice open a live rat over her, and insert a giant larva into Kims vagina. It emerges from her mouth as a fullgrown, giant, multisegmented roach; she vomits the creature out. Ricky slices the creature in half and drips its innards onto Kims face. Kim wakes up later fully dressed, still in Fimas apartment. She rushes home, terrified, and finds Hank, who is able to calm her. Ricky then enters the apartment and stabs Hank to death. Kim manages to answer her ringing phone during the fight and screams for her coworker Janice to help her. Ricky captures Kim and binds her. Janice arrives, but doesnt help Kim. Instead, she admonishes Ricky for the mess and tells him to take Kim straight to Fima. Ricky locks Kim in the meat locker at a meat shop nextdoor to Fimas bookstore where she passes out again. When she awakens, she is surrounded by the entire cult. Ricky, wearing a phallic mask, rapes Kim. Kim reawakens alone in the meat locker; her fingers bind themselves together in a knot. Then she experiences incredible pain as her legs bind together into an insectlike tail. Kim passes out again. She awakens in the meat locker as Jo opens the door. He frees her legs from a brittle cocoonlike substance and covers her as best as he can. Jo tells her that she has been initiated and that she should go. Kim brings a policeman, Detective Burt, to her apartment. There, everything is spotless and theres no trace of Hanks body. At her offices Christmas party, Eli claims that Hank is away on an assignment. Janice is there, and welcomes her to the family. Furious and confused, Kim storms out of the office and walks down onto the sidewalk. She notices Ricky following her and ducks into a motel room. Her feet begin to get painfully hot. She jumps into the shower, but they still burst into tiny flames. Ricky enters the room and, in pain, Kim agrees to kidnap Hanks teenaged brother Lonnie to complete the initiation. Kim lures Lonnie out of his house, and Ricky murders Hanks parents by strangling them with Christmas lights, then setting the house on fire. On the building roof, Kim is asked to stab Lonnie; instead, she stabs Fima. In anger, Fima pulls the knife from her stomach and stabs Ricky. A giant larva feeds on the wounded man as Kims legs begin to get hot. Kims hands knot themselves together once again, then they start to burst into flame. She then stabs her fused hands into Fimas wound.

He wakes up backstage, in the dressing room of Lola, a drag queen performer and alter ego of Simon. Charlie is intrigued when he sees that drag queens high heels snap easily since they have only womens shoes to wear, rather than those that can support the weight of a larger male body frame. Back in Northampton, while in the process of laying off workers, one employee, Lauren, gives Charlie the idea of looking for a niche market product to save the business. Charlie then recruits Lauren to assist him in designing a highheeled boot for drag performers. When their initial designs are met with scorn by Lola, Charlie and Lauren bring her on as a consultant. The road is initially bumpy: many of the male employees are uncomfortable with Lolas presence and the new direction, and Charlies relationship with his fiancee, Nicola, begins to deteriorate as she encourages him to sell the factory building to a real estate developer. Although things improve when Lola tones down her personality and starts making friends, matters take a turn for the worse when Charlie is invited to showcase the new boots in Milan; the strain he puts on his employees causes most of them, including Lola, to walk out. Charlies fiancee arrives at the factory, furious that he took out a second mortgage on their house to save the company. Nicola insists that he sell the company, but Charlie is determined to save it and the jobs of his employees. The argument which ends with Nicola leaving Charlie is broadcast on the factorys PA system, which is overheard by Lauren and Lolas bitterest opponent at the factory, Don, a chauvinistic male worker. Don turns over a new leaf after Lola had graciously allowed him to win an arm wrestling match, and rallies the factory workers to make the boots in time for Charlie and Lauren to get to Milan. When Charlie catches Nicola with another man, he angrily takes out his frustrations on Lola, causing Lola to quit. After arriving in Milan with no one to model the boots, Charlie is forced to go onstage and model the boots himself.

In the meantime, Eashwar is also able to obtain a facial composite of the caller with help of the police officer to whom the caller had approached to lodge the fake FIR during the earlier scenes of the film; but much of the time passes without any concrete results on the identity or the location of the caller. Ultimately, Eashwar agrees with the callers demand and puts two of his best men, Arif Khan Ganesh Venkatraman and Gautham Reddy Dr. Bharath Reddy, in charge of handing over the four terrorists along with cell phones at the old Begumpet Airport end of Runway no. 4. The caller also demands reporter Shilpa to reach the nearest police station at Begumpet. The caller calls up Eashwar, as he is on the way, for a final time to further reveal that he had not planted any other bomb in the city. At this point, Eashwar surprisingly declares he already knew there were no more bombs which make it clear that his decision to kill the last terrorist wasnt taken in fear but in confidence. Eashwar reaches the callers location just as the latter is leaving the place, having destroyed all his gadgets and equipment, leaving behind no evidence. The two meet briefly when Eashwar, identifying the anonymous caller on the basis of the face sketch, offers the man a ride home and introduces himself. Both shake hands when Eeshwars voiceover cuts back as he says the man told him his real name, but his name doesnt have any significance. The film ends on an idealistic note, with Eashwar admitting that they all knew the common man was disturbed because of the insecure environment and the incompetence of the governing authorities, but he never imagined him to go to such lengths and have the guts to do something like that. He also repeats that the facts of this incident cannot be found in any written record but only in the memories of those who actually witnessed it, and acknowledges that although the incidence has ambiguous moral significance, he personally feels that whatever happened, happened for the best.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

He immediately encounters one of the creatures, which is using an oversized mallet to strike the unfused nose of Bugs bomb to the tune of Ive Been Working on the Railroad. Bugs casually asks the gremlin after his business, and the gremlin replies that perfect precision is necessary to ensure the denotation of blockbuster bombs such as the one in question. Noticing the gremlins lack of success, Bugs offers to help him, but after taking the mallet and raising it in preparation to strike the bomb, Bugs suddenly comes to his senses and refrains from following through, just milliseconds from striking it, screaming WHAT AM I DOING?! as he does so. He then ponders if the creature in question were a gremlin, and the gremlin replies with a shout: It aint Vendell Villkie!

His catandmouse game with the gremlin continues, until Bugs realizes that the gremlin is flying the plane toward a pair of skyscrapers. Bugs rushes into the cockpit, takes control of the airplane, rolls it vertically, and flies through an extremely narrow slot between the towers to avoid what seemed to be an inevitable impact. The plane goes into a tailspin, its wings ripping off during its descent, with only the fuselage remaining, making Bugs both airsick and terrified. However, the plane sputters to a halt, half a short distance above the ground and hanging in midair, defying gravity. Both Bugs and the Gremlin then casually address the audience: the gremlin apologizes for the planes fuel depletion, while Bugs points to a wartime gas rationing sticker on the planes windshield and remarks: Yeah.

This group of five consists of three scientists, Zanes step brother Jack Addison a computer expert whom he has not seen in seven years, and a reporter named Bridget Riordan. They receive papers talking of global warming and of aliens terraforming Earth into a planet hot like their own dying world. The group gets together in a large freezer as the aliens cant stand cold to see what Zane has left them. They find some alien artifacts in an envelope left to the group. One of the five, Trevor Anguilar, suffers from the cold and is revealed as an alien.

The aliens have set the FBI on the two as well as cancelling their credit cards and emptying Addisons bank account of 15,000. The pair have only one artifact left and that produces a perfect 3D hologram when a laser beam is shone through it. They use it to find out that an atomic power plant due to be opened near where they are in Quebec is in the hands of the aliens. Later it is revealed that it is to go critical and will spread deadly radiation over many hundreds of miles the aliens are immune to radiation. Addison and Riordan attempt to show the hologram at a climate seminar, and Addisons boss, Burke, agrees to help them. But before they can activate the device, they are caught by Dave Cyrus, another of Addisons coworkers who has sold them out to the FBI. Burke kills Cyrus and frames Addison for it, revealing himself to be an alien as well. Barely escaping, Addison and Riordan break into a university and use an industrial laser to properly activate the artifact Addison uses his computer skills to walk around and interact with an alien ship in space and to program a giant BHB deep below the power plant to go off in one hour. The aliens arrive and both are captured from the hologram. In the atomic power station, their time seems to be up till the giant BHB goes off in the alien area below it and starts ripping apart and swallowing the atomic power station. Wotan and Wolfe are dragged through the gaping hole in the floor. Nearly dragged into its sphere of influence himself, Addison uses a small BHB to stop the giant one long enough for he and Riordan to escape. They just make it as all that is left of the power station is a huge hole in the ground. Burke also survives, but injured, his alien features partly visible. He warns Addison that the aliens havent been stopped, just delayed.

The two boys dont mix well with a home in modern Chicago; their formal, Amishlike clothes from Gatlin and Elis fireandbrimstone prayer at dinner, as well as his bringing a suitcase full of corn to Chicago, strike their new parents and neighbors as unusual. On his first night in Chicago, after everyone else has gone to sleep, Eli quietly leaves the Porters house for an empty factory on the other side of a nearby cornfield. Taking with him the suitcase of corn, Eli prays to He Who Walks Behind the Rows and plants corn seeds on the grounds of the factory, causing rows of corn to appear almost instantly. The next day, at their first day in school, Eli nearly gets into a fight with TLoc, a student in Joshuas grade, and harshly criticizes Joshua for playing basketball with some of the other students. Disgusted with the lifestyle being lived by modern children, Eli decides to bring He Who Walks Behind the Rows to Chicago, which soon kills a homeless man who finds the cornfield. Joshua starts spending less time with Eli and makes friends with neighbors Maria and Malcolm. The social worker who brought Eli and Joshua to the Porters discovers that Eli was adopted originally from Gatlin, Nebraska the town from the first film. Furthermore, Eli has not aged since 1964.

She attempts to escape, but trips on a pole and her head is impaled on a broken pipe, killing her instantly. William finds the cornfield Eli has planted and realizes that with its seemingly perfect nature invulnerable to disease, able to grow out of season and in the worst of soil, it could be a highly marketable product. Despite the death of his wife, which was arranged by Eli, William finds backers and looks forward to the massive profits Elis strain of corn will bring. Eli neglects to inform his foster father of another property the corn possesses \u2014 it is able to turn children who eat it into followers of He Who Walks Behind the Rows. Eli begins to decisively sway the students of his high school towards his beliefs, turning them against the principal and directing them to abandon such previouslytypical activities as basketball. The principal, alarmed at Elis converting the students, attempts to inform other staff, but they dont believe him, as Elis efforts have had another effect: They have restored order at the school to a degree few thought possible. By the time Joshua realizes the full truth, Eli has killed both of their foster parents, the school principal, Malcolm and Marias parents, and now has full control of his fellow students. Confronting him, Joshua reveals that he has gone back to Gatlin and found the bible of He Who Walks Behind the Rows which resulted in Malcolms death, a book that Eli holds sacred and, together with his own body, can survive indefinitely if one is intact. Eli roars, Give me the book! and charges. Joshua throws the book down, and as Eli scrambles to pick it up Joshua stabs Eli and the book with a sickle, destroying both. After Eli dies, He Who Walks Behind the Rows rises from the cornfield, revealed to be a grotesque monster with several tentacles.

However, the restaurant is all out of food, so he invites her to his apartment. Before they arrive, Abel, another equally hungry and unemployed person, sneaks in for a chicken leg. Hearing them coming, he hides in a bedroom. When Jennie enters the room to remove her coat, he begs her not to cause trouble. She sympathizes with his plight and says nothing to Billy. Just then, Hugo Brant Francis L. Sullivan, Billys gangster employer, and his men barge in. They make Jennie leave. When Billy admits that he is quitting, Brant shoots him dead. To get rid of loose ends, Hugo sends Harrigan aboard the ocean liner bound for Southampton with Jennie. He frames Jennie for robbery. Meanwhile, Abel, who was caught by the building watchman as he tried to sneak out, is tried and sentenced to death for Coopers murder. The woman he insists can exonerate him is in HM Prison Holloway, unaware of his plight. Hugo and gang member Mortimer travel to England to deal with Jennie. When Jennie gets out of prison, her mother introduces her to her new tenant, a priest named Mr. Mortimer. After reading in the newspaper about Abels impending execution, she goes to Scotland Yard, despite Mortimers warning that she might herself become a suspect. She finds that other women have turned up, all claiming to be the missing witness. Inspector Jim Grant is skeptical, and that turns into certainty when Mortimer shows up and totally discredits her. Meanwhile, Brant, under the alias of wouldbe Paraguayan dictator General Costello, receives a message at his hotel, informing him of the developments. The messenger, Spurgeon Peter Bull, later sneaks back in and collects the tornup pieces to sell to bookmaker and blackmailer Sam Pryor Frank Cellier. Treacherously, Spurgeon also tips off Inspector Grant for a price that Pryor will be flying to New York on blackmail business. With only two days before the execution and not enough money to pay for airfare, Jennie sneaks aboard the Atlantic Airlines Libson Clipper, a giant transatlantic flying boat. The paying passengers include Costello, 14yearold violin prodigy Arnold James Desmond Tester and his aunt Veronica Athene Seyler, Pryor and Grant. Jennie finds an empty compartment. It turns out to Grants; while he is deciding what to do when he discovers her, the aircraft takes off. After she leaves, he informs a crewman that he will pay her fare. When Pryor tries to blackmail Costello, the latter bluffs him into leaving. Pryor then finds out that Jennie has some connection to the inspector; he passes himself off as a Scotland Yard superintendent and learns from her her involvement in the murder. She remarks that one of the perpetrators was able to light a match with one hand, a feat he saw Costello perform. He brings Jennie to Costellos table at dinnertime, but Costello remains outwardly unfazed. Late that night, by chance, Jennie and Costello are the last ones left in the lounge. He lures the unsuspecting young woman out on the openair balcony, intending to push her over, but Pryor is watching. Now in a much stronger bargaining position, he demands not \u00a31,000 but \u00a320,000, this time for not interfering with Costellos murderous plan. Costello seemingly gives in and leads him into the baggage compartment to get the money, but instead shoots the blackmailer dead. There is an unseen witness, however: Arnold. He wakes Grant. Meanwhile, Costello tries to strangle Jennie. When Grant hears her screams, he bursts in, only to be held at gunpoint. Arnold provides a distraction. Costello grabs a parachute, makes his way to the cockpit, locks the door, shoots the pilot and jumps out. With the aircraft careening out of control, Grant goes outside, makes his way across the top of the fuselage clinging to a cable handrail, to the cockpit, and opens the door for the other pilot, who regains control just in time. When Grant radios for a police cordon for Costello, Arnold sheepishly admits he cut out a piece of the parachute to muffle his saxophone.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

Mary Lou assumes it is Credences wand, but Modesty says it is hers. When Modesty is about to be punished, the Obscurus kills Mary Lou and her eldest daughter Chastity. Graves arrives, and after Credence leads him to Modesty, whom he assumes is the Obscuruss host, he dismisses Credence as being a Squib and refuses to teach him magic. Credence reveals he is the real host, having lived longer than any other host due to the intensity of his magic. In a fit of rage, Credence transforms and attacks the city. Newt finds Credence hiding in a subway tunnel, but he is attacked by Graves. Tina, who knows Credence, arrives and attempts to calm him, while Graves tries to convince Credence to listen to him. As Credence begins to settle into human form, Aurors arrive and apparently disintegrate him to protect the magical society; however, a tiny Obscurus fragment escapes. Graves admits to unleashing the Obscurus to expose the magical community to the NoMajs and framing Newt for it, and angrily claims that MACUSA protects the NoMajs more than themselves. After being subdued by one of Newts beasts, he is revealed as Grindelwald in disguise and is taken into custody.

Against the background of the development of Kharlamovs hockey career, the story of his acquaintance and love with Irina Smirnova is shown, who tries to support the hockey player in difficult moments. After the scandalous match between the USSR national team and HC Spartak Moscow, when Tarasov led the team away from the ice in a protest against refereeing, the upset Kharlamov gets into a car accident and seriously injures his leg in the film this biographical episode of the hockey player was shifted to be four years earlier.

During the mission, Bond notices that the KGB sniper assigned to prevent Koskovs escape is a female cellist from the orchestra. Disobeying his orders to kill the sniper, he instead shoots the rifle from her hands, then uses the TransSiberian Pipeline to smuggle Koskov across the border into Austria and then on to Britain. In his postdefection debriefing, Koskov informs MI6 that the KGBs old policy of Smiert Spionam, meaning Death to Spies, has been revived by General Leonid Pushkin, the new head of the KGB. Koskov is later abducted from the safehouse and assumed to have been taken back to Moscow. Bond is directed to track down Pushkin in Tangier and kill him to forestall further killings of agents and escalation of tensions between the Soviet Union and the West. Bond agrees to carry out the mission when he learns that the assassin who killed 004 as depicted in the pretitle sequence left a note bearing the same message, Smiert Spionam. Bond returns to Bratislava to track down the cellist, Kara Milovy. He determines that Koskovs entire defection was staged, and that Kara is actually Koskovs girlfriend. Bond convinces Kara that he is a friend of Koskovs and persuades her to accompany him to Vienna, supposedly to be reunited with him. They escape Bratislava while being pursued by the KGB, crossing over the border into Austria. Meanwhile, Pushkin meets with an arms dealer, Brad Whitaker, in Tangier, informing him that the KGB is cancelling an arms deal previously arranged between Koskov and Whitaker. During his brief tryst with Milovy in Vienna, Bond visits the Prater to meet his MI6 ally, Saunders, who discovers a history of financial dealings between Koskov and Whitaker. As he leaves their meeting, Saunders is killed by Koskovs henchman Necros, who again leaves the message Smiert Spionam. Bond and Kara promptly leave for Tangier, where Bond confronts Pushkin. Pushkin disavows any knowledge of Smiert Spionam, and reveals that Koskov is evading arrest for embezzlement of government funds. Bond and Pushkin then join forces and Bond fakes Pushkins assassination, inducing Whitaker and Koskov to progress with their scheme. Meanwhile, Kara contacts Koskov, who tells her that Bond is actually a KGB agent and convinces her to drug him so he can be captured. Koskov, Necros, Kara, and the captive Bond fly to a Soviet air base in Afghanistan, where Koskov betrays Kara and imprisons her along with Bond. The pair escape and in doing so free a condemned prisoner, Kamran Shah, leader of the local Mujahideen. Bond and Milovy discover that Koskov is using Soviet funds to buy a massive shipment of opium from the Mujahideen, intending to keep the profits with enough left over to supply the Soviets with their arms and buy Western arms from Whitaker. With the Mujahideens help, Bond plants a bomb aboard the cargo plane carrying the opium, but is spotted and has no choice but to barricade himself in the plane. Meanwhile, the Mujahideen attack the air base on horseback and engage the Soviets in a gun battle. During the battle, Milovy drives a jeep into the cargo hold of the plane as Bond takes off, and Necros also leaps aboard at the last second. After a struggle, Bond throws Necros to his death and deactivates the bomb. Bond then notices Shah and his men being pursued by Soviet forces. He reactivates the bomb and drops it out of the plane and onto a bridge, blowing it up and helping Shah and his men gain an important victory over the Soviets. Bond returns to Tangier to kill Whitaker, infiltrating his estate with the help of his ally Felix Leiter, as Pushkin arrests Koskov, sending him back to Moscow.

At first, Alma enjoys being a part of Reynolds work, but he proves aloof and hard to please, and they bicker. When Alma tries to surprise him with a romantic dinner, Reynolds lashes out and they fight. Alma wonders aloud what she is doing in his house beyond either waiting for him to pay attention to her or ask her to leave. In order to regain her power in their relationship and to punish and make Reynolds more vulnerable and needy, Alma laces his tea with a small amount of poisonous mushroom gathered outside his country house.

Believing that he is in need of help, Sylvester proudly joins Birds Anonymous, a group of cats who have banded together to overcome their addictions to birds. Sylvester lives by this motto: Birds is strictly for the birds!

Sylvester replies: I think... I think... I think youre... I think youre...

However, when the cat kisses Tweety to prove his point, years of his denial take their toll and the B.A. cat attempts to devour Tweety himself, this time with Sylvester restraining him and telling him to control himself.

They think that Jason has followed them, but when they open the door, they are greeted by Terrys dog, Muffin. Suddenly, an unmasked Jason bursts through the window from behind and grabs Ginny.

He then goes on to talk about how people who dont speak English only pick up the curse words in his act, and shout them at him on the street. Next comes a lengthy routine about dating and relationships. Murphy explains that the rise of deadly sexually transmitted infections has motivated him to seek marriage, but the divorce of Johnny Carson and Joanna Holland in which she sought 50 of his assets has left him paranoid about the financial risk of marriage, concluding that no pussy is worth 150 million. He mocks the aggression and materialism of American women compared to the meekness of Japanese women, referring to the popularity of Janet Jacksons song What Have You Done for Me Lately. He jokes that he intends to go deep into Africa to find a bush bitch who has no concept of Western culture... at least until American women convince her to stand up for herself and demand HALF!

He also recruits Lieutenant Garcia Ronnie Lazaro after seeing his marksmanship skills, and makes him commander of his elite unit of sharpshooters. As the war drags on, Buencamino and Paterno indicate their support of a proposal by the Americans for Philippine autonomy. Enraged by this, Luna orders their arrest. Luna\u2019s campaign is undermined by General Tomas Mascardo Lorenz Martinez, who opposes Lunas order for reinforcements, stating that he will only follow the Presidents direct orders. While the two generals are about to clash in Pampanga, the Americans advance steadily as other Filipino generals like Gregorio del Pilar Paulo Avelino retreat to the north. Luna visits Aguinaldo and Mabini to file his resignation, knowing that Buencamino and Paterno had been set free. Aguinaldo refuses to accept his resignation, but agrees to let Luna establish a headquarters for the Philippine Army in the north. Later, Luna is summoned by a telegram to the President\u2019s headquarters in Cabanatuan. Although his officers are suspicious, Luna rides to Cabanatuan, bringing only Roman and Rusca with him. Most of the soldiers had already left headquarters under Aguinaldos orders, with the exception of some elements of the Kawit Battalion. Luna discovers upon arrival that Aguinaldo had already left and only Buencamino remains in the office. As they exchange heated words, a single shot is fired outside. Luna investigates and encounters Captain Janolino and his men, who attack him. Luna is shot, stabbed, and hacked repeatedly to death. Roman is also killed while a wounded Rusca surrenders to the Kawit soldiers. Most of Lunas remaining loyal officers are arrested, while some are killed, including the Bernal brothers. As ordered by Aguinaldo, Luna and Roman are buried with full military honors by the Kawit Battalion  the same men who killed them. Mabini, who is among the mourners, notices a bloodied Bolo of one of the soldiers; however, the Kawit Battalion would be exonerated thereafter. While American newspapers quickly blame Aguinaldo for the death of Luna, after the war an aged Aguinaldo denies his involvement on the assassination; he acknowledges Antonio Luna as his most brilliant and most capable general. MacArthur and Otis acknowledge Luna as a worthy adversary, laughing at the fact that the Filipinos killed the only real general they had. In the midcredits scene, General Gregorio del Pilar makes ready to cover Aguinaldos retreat to the north. He gathers Lunas remaining men and orders his aide to select 60 of them.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

A pugilistic exconvict known as Crumps Brother is picked up by a local teen while hitchhiking on the freeway and informs him about two women he intends to party with in Torrance Beach. The teen then informs his friends about the situation, but no one wishes to anger Crumps Brother by tagging along. Joe and Hubbs, as they drive around town in their 1973 Volkswagen Type 3 Squareback, The Blue Torpedo looking for drugs and women. They come across Tack, who informs them of the girls. Their friend Crump, the gas station attendant, also tells them of the girls. They strand Tack at the gas station, and head for Torrance Beach. They arrive at the house and find an extremely attractive girl named Lanie who sends them off to a liquor store for alcohol. When they return, they find the homeowners daughter Jill, a misanthropic hippie girl who is Lanies friend. In the meantime, Tack conscripts his nerdy friend Norm Snotrag Hankey to take him to the beach. They arrive at the house and after a brief scuffle, Tack entices cooperation with news of a party in Palos Verdes, much to Joe and Hubbs chagrin. At the house party, Muldoon, the party host, lets the girls in but shuts everyone else out. Lanie leaves following an altercation with Muldoon and drafts Joe to take her swimming in a neighbors pool. The police shut down the party, and Hubbs and Jill locate Joe and Lanie next door. Lanie is smitten with Hubbs aggressive nature, much to Joes chagrin, and the two walk upstairs for sex. Having lost their beer to the police, Tack and the others raid a liquor warehouse for beer, and head for the house. Joe and Jill partially reconcile but return to find Tack and the Guzzlers converging on the home. A fight breaks out between Joe and Tack and Jill runs inside, eventually letting Joe back in and locking the door. After getting stoned, Hubbs tells Joe hes arranged for Lanie to give him fellatio as a birthday present. Joe finds that Lanie asleep, covers her up, and walks out; he finds Hubbs with Jill making out on the couch; Joe is upset but learns that Jill was the instigator. They are interrupted when Crumps Brother arrives outside and begins to break down the door. They flee to the kitchen but shortly afterwards, they hear the commotion dying out; Jills father, Warren, has returned from a college reunion and beaten the entire crowd of kids\u2014including Crumps Brother\u2014to unconsciousness with great ease. While Hubbs manages to escape by jumping through a window on the upper floor, Warren retains Joe and holds him hostage awaiting the arrival of the police. Eventually, a condescending lecture provokes a fight and Joe and Hubbs dramatically escape just ahead of the police. Enamored with Joe, Jill gives him her full name and geographical location north so he can look her up later. The police arrest the entire crew of drunken teenagers, and Joe and Hubbs escape in the Blue Torpedo. Hubbs jocularly chides Joe for his apparent cowardice in moving on Lanie and Jill, and dismisses Jill as a viable partner. Joe, no longer tolerant of Hubbs attitude, wrestles a surprised Hubbs into submission while driving and forces him to capitulate that Jill is cool. Joe then places the Blue Oyster Cult 8track tape into the deck and plays Dont Fear the Reaper. The song plays as the Blue Torpedo drives off through the night. Following the credits, Joe and Hubbs are offered Blue Oyster Cult concert Tshirts outside a convenience store by two men, but Joe refuses because the shirts are bootlegs, and not official. The scalpers are played by actual Blue Oyster Cult band members Eric Bloom and Donald Buck Dharma Roeser.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

Cargill willingly admits his guilt and brings forth evidence that proves that he signed a germwarfare confession and broadcast antiAmerican speeches over the radio, seemingly an act of treason. It seems to be an openandshut case, were it not for Cargills inexplicable refusal to defend himself. Arousing further suspicion is the fact that his collaboration immediately followed the deaths of two of his soldiers, and the units survivors all recite an identical, rehearsed account of those deaths.

In the end, the shocking truth comes out. Lieutenant George Miller Rip Torn reveals that after Lieutenant Harvey Manning Ross was killed trying to escape, the rest of the men discovered that, under torture, Captain Connors had betrayed him. Over Cargills strong objections, they decided to execute Connors. Drawing the short straw, Miller had to strangle him. Subsequently, their captor, Colonel Kim Khigh Dhiegh, gave Cargill an ultimatum: give in, or all his men would be executed. He agreed to collaborate with the enemy to save their lives. General Connors calls his son a traitor. Cargill argues, stating that there must be a time limit on being a hero. He denounces the Uniform Code of Military Justice espoused by General Connors for demanding too much from soldiers, but the general reminds him that while Cargill anguished over the lives and families of 16 men, that many commanders had to anguish over the effect of their orders on the lives and families of thousands. Edwards agrees with General Connors that although Cargill acted out of a humane selflessness, Cargills judgment was flawed. He recommends that all charges be dropped, but warns Cargill that there will be a courtmartial. Edwards himself will defend Cargill.

A devastated and distraught Raju now declares that Veeru is solely responsible for whatever happened and that the latter is now his mortal enemy. With these new developments, the duo have their territories marked.

Forrester later drops Jamals backpack onto the street. Jamal returns home to find that Forrester wrote notes in Jamals journals. Jamal returns to Forresters apartment and asks him to read more of his writing. Forrester tells him to begin with 5,000 words on why Jamal should stay the fuck out of my home, which he completes and leaves on the doorstep the following day. Jamal returns the next day and is invited inside. Forrester knows that a representative from MailorCallow, a prestigious private school, offered Jamal a full academic scholarship, partly for his skill on the basketball court and partly for his test scores. Jamal learns that Forrester is the author of a famous book, Avalon Landing and that he has never published another. Forrester agrees to help Jamal with his writing as long as Jamal does not ask about his personal life or tell others of his whereabouts. Jamals writing improves, which causes Robert Crawford, a professor at MailorCallow, to suspect plagiarism. Jamal convinces Forrester to attend a game at Madison Square Garden but Forrester cannot handle the crowds and has an anxiety attack. Jamal takes him instead to see Yankee Stadium late at night after everyone has gone where Forrester tells Jamal details about his family, which explains the basis of his book, specifically his brothers postwar trauma, alcoholism and Forresters indirect role in his death. He also explains how the subsequent deaths of his parents soon after affected him and led to his becoming a recluse. Forrester gives Jamal some of his own private essays to rewrite, with the condition that Jamal is not to take them from the apartment. Meanwhile, there is a school writing contest coming up and Crawford forces Jamal to stay after school so he can watch him produce an essay. Jamal can not write under such conditions and running out of time, he submits one of Forresters exercises to the contest. Jamal is then called in by Crawford and the school board who reveal that Forrester indeed published the article that Jamals essay is based on. Crawford finds the parallels between the two pieces and brings Jamal up on plagiarism charges. Jamal must either cite Forresters work or prove he had Forresters permission to use the material. He refuses to do either to keep his promise to Forrester. Crawford demands that Jamal write an apology letter to his classmates and read it in front of the class which Jamal also refuses which may lead to his expulsion. Jamal tells Forrester what he has done and asks him to defend him but Forrester is angry at Jamal for breaking his promise about taking the paper. Jamal accuses Forrester of being scared and selfish for not helping him. Jamal is told by the school that they will drop the plagiarism charges if he wins them the state championship. Jamal does well in the game but ambiguously misses two free throw shots at the end of the game, costing the team the championship. Jamal writes an essay to Forrester that discusses the gift of friendship. Jamals brother, Terrell, finds the essay sealed in an envelope and gives it to Forrester. Jamal attends the school contest. During the readings by other students, Forrester appears, announces himself and receives permission to read an essay that draws overwhelming applause from the students. As Crawford is praising the work, Forrester acknowledges his friendship with Jamal and reveals that the essay he had just read was written by Jamal. He also explains that Jamal had written the contest essay using the published title and first paragraph with permission. Crawford adamantly states that this will not change any of the boards decisions. The board overrules him and drops the plagiarism charges, readmitting Jamals entry to the competition.

She is made a scapegoat for the militarys losses during the battle and transferred to a desk job. During the battle, it was discovered that Godzilla is immune to maser fire, rendering all of the Japanese military useless against it should it return. Scientists, including single father Tokumitsu Yuhara, are gathered to build a biomechanical robot from the original Godzillas skeleton. Four years later, the cyborg Mechagodzilla, named Kiryu, is finished and inducted into the Japan SelfDefense Forces along with its human pilots as the Kiryu Squadron. Akane becomes the main pilot for Kiryu. However, memories of Akanes actions during the original fight still linger, and one of her squadron mates, Second Lieutenant Susumu Hayama holds her responsible for the death of his brother who was crushed to death when Godzilla stepped on his car while he was inside during their first fight. Four years later, in 2003, Mechagodzilla is shown to the world, and the complete system that controls the unit is explained. Controlled remotely from a control craft that resembles a very large jet fighter with VSTOL capabilities, it can be remotely recharged from the ground using microwaves that are relayed through a power system on one of the command aircraft, and then beamed back down to the robot. For the end of the presentation, its greatest and most powerful weapon, the freezing Absolute Zero Cannon, is shown. At the same time, Godzilla shows up once again, and Kiryu is launched into battle. In the midst of the first battle, Kiryus soul is awoken by Godzillas roar and brings with it the memories of the original Godzillas death. As if possessed by the original Godzilla, Kiryu proceeds to destroy the city around it after Godzilla retreats to the ocean floor. Horrified, the Kiryu Squadron can only watch in alarm as the rampaging cyborg destroys more city property than Godzilla did. After one hour, Kiryu runs out of energy and is brought back to headquarters for further work. All the while, Akane attempts to settle matters involving Hayama, Tokumitsu, and his distressed daughter, Sara who sees Kiryu as a being with a right to life and believes that it should befriend Godzilla rather than battle it. Later, Godzilla attacks again. After repairs are made, Kiryu is released from the air and hits Godzilla with immense speed. At this point, Godzilla and Mechagodzilla face off in a headtohead battle where each combatant sizes up its opposite and exchange powerful blows that also devastate the cityscape around them. Kiryu gains the upper hand and beats down Godzilla. Kiryu proceeds to launch the Absolute Zero Cannon, but Godzilla fires its atomic breath. During the course of the impact, Kiryu is disabled, and the remote piloting system completely taken offline. In an effort to continue the fight and press what advantage over Godzilla they still have, Akane orders the pilot to land his command craft so that she can make her way to Mechagodzilla and take control from its internal backup cockpit. Now under direct human control, Kiryu rises from the ground one more time and closes in on Godzilla for a final blow, hoping to use the Absolute Zero Cannon at pointblank range. The two titans collide, and Akane uses Kiryus thrusters to propel it and Godzilla out to sea before the cannon fires, freezing a huge portion of the ocean around them. After the blast clears, Godzilla is shown to be alive but with a huge gash in its chest, steadily walking back into the ocean. Kiryu is heavily damaged, missing its right arm, and the Absolute Zero Cannon is devastated. With the Kiryu Squadron successful in defeating the monster, Godzilla retreats. In a postcredits scene, Akane agrees to have dinner with Tokumitsu and Sara and gives Kiryu one last salute for its aid in battling Godzilla.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

He is sent home for recovery as a war hero for taking out a German machine gun position. While in hospital in Calgary, Alberta, he meets nurse Sarah Mann Caroline Dhavernas, where he had originally enlisted. David Mann Joe Dinicol is Sarahs younger brother, ineligible for military service due to asthma but determined to enlist. The Manns are ostracized when it becomes known their father died at Vimy Ridge when with the Imperial German Army. The father of Davids girlfriend pulls strings to allow him to enlist. Dunne feels responsible for Davids wellbeing and reenlists as a private under his mothers maiden name McCrae. David and Michael end up in the battlefields of Belgium. Sarah also enlists and follows the 10th as a nurse in triage at an Advanced Dressing Station near the front. The three arrive in Flanders in time for the Battle of Passchendaele. Dunne and Sarah soon meet up again when Dunne brings a wounded man to the aid station. Dunnes cover as McCrae is soon blown, he manages to escape punishment and is promoted to platoon leader by Lieutenant Colonel Ormond, who knew him from earlier combat, when his past actions should have got a V.C. and because of the need for experienced soldiers as high casualties were expected. When the Canadians launch their attack, the 8th Battalion Winnipeg Rifles, known as the Little Black Devils, faces a German counterattack and become pinned down. Dunnes company is sent to support them. After the support company arrives, the 8th Battalion retreats from the battlefield, wrongly believing that they are finally relieved, leaving the job of holding the ground to Dunnes small force. As the reality of the war begins to set in, David Mann begins to realize the war was not what he believed it would be. Dunnes forces spend the night in their trenches, and as a result of the shelling, David begins to have an asthmaticpanic attack and Dunne calms him down, relieving the problem. The next morning the Germans counterattack, and make it as far as the line, and both forces attack each other in close quarters combat. As the Germans retreat, David breaks down and chases them back to surrender. He jumps into their trenches and is met by a gun to the face where he begs in German. He is about to be shot when an artillery shell lands and the explosion throws him onto what is effectively a cross, created by walkway timbers from the trench. He is visually crucified by the explosion. This relates to Dunnes earlier story of the legendary report of the crucified soldier. When Dunne sees this he takes his helmet off, throws his gun down and runs to David, in a reckless attempt to keep his promise to keep him alive, getting shot in the process. He crawls to the cross on his knees, looking up at it. The Germans stop firing and allow him to retrieve David, whom he carries back to his own lines. The fighting swiftly resumes with a shell landing. David lives, but Dunne is carried to the hospital where he dies after his last words with Sarah. This happens just as the news comes in that the Canadians have captured Passchendaele Ridge. The ending scene shows the wheelchairbound David Mann now only with one leg; Sarah Mann; Davids girlfriend Cassie; and Dunnes best friend Royster Gil Bellows paying tribute at Dunnes grave on his home farm.

Thirtysix hours previously, Cornell is on campus. He is a college professor, was once a promising writer, made his name and is secure in his tenure, but he has spent the last four years going through the motions and playing it safe. Publish or perish is the contrasting rule of university politics and Cornell helps his friend Hal Petersham Daniel Stern with his first book. While Cornell is in his office, a promising student, Nick Lang Robert Knepper, jumps off a building right outside his office window in an apparent suicide. This, coupled with the depressing Christmas season, unseasonably hot weather, and a pending divorce with his estranged wife Gail Jane Kaczmarek whom he suspects was having an affair with Lang, leads Cornell to seek out the local bars for a night of heavy drinking. There he meets admiring student Sydney Fuller Meg Ryan and they proceed to get drunk. The next morning, Cornell, feeling his sickness is more than just a hangover, stops by the campus medical clinic for a checkup. After running some tests, they discover that he has been poisoned and has 36 hours to live. An incredulous Cornell staggers out to try to make sense of it all. Aided by Fuller, whom he kidnaps by supergluing himself to her arm, he attempts to recreate the events of the previous night hoping to discover who could have murdered him. The list of suspects includes his wife, who is also the victim of a murder, which the police make halfhearted efforts to pin on Cornell. It is learned that Lang was not a suicide but was also murdered. Cornell also suspects Langs mentor Mrs. Fitzwaring Charlotte Rampling, Bernard Christopher Neame the Fitzwarings chauffeur and Graham Corey Jay Patterson, a jealous coworker. In the end, at the police station, Cornell has solved the crime. His friend Hal had read and was so impressed by Nick Langs manuscript that he decided to kill Nick and steal the novel for himself. However, this involved killing anyone who knew that Nick was the original author, including Dexter. After a scuffle, Dexter shoots Hal who then falls out his office window.

A smart retort to the officers question has him carted off to jail for no visible means of support. The following day hes in court hearing 50 dollars or 30 days. Listening to the exchange is cagey lawyer Philip Cagle Robert Douglas, who pays his fine. After a meal and a taxi ride the pair enter the attorneys office, where he explains why. The counselor is the executor of the estate of a wealthy man whom the bum just happens to resemble exactly. The rich man has been missing for seven years minus two weeks and is about to be declared legally dead, which would be inconvenient for the lawyer. Though its unclear why. If David will agree to impersonate the missing man hell be paid 500. Holding out for 5,000 the pair come to terms then ride to a huge house near a cliff belonging to the missing man. During the journey the lawyer adds some information about the mans task. He must fool three people \u2014 the mans wife, his brother and the brothers wife. He adds at the end of the trip, just as they arrive: By the way, your brother hates you. David soon finds that it isnt just the brother who is none too fond. His wife Evelyn Viveca Lindfors is more than a little estranged, apparently as a result of the husbands many affairs and general callousness before his disappearance. Fortunately, Evelyn doesnt know that husband Malcolm Taylors most recent affair was with his brothers wife, Nadine Taylor Janis Paige. The impersonation comes off well for some time as David insinuates himself into the family until Nadine notices his hands, which lack some telltale scars. David tells Philip and the lawyer connives to have her meet him at a lonely spot on the estate, then shoves her off the cliff. Things move rapidly ahead from this point, past various confusing scenes that ultimately result in Philip tossing David into the cistern. His plan all along was to continue to act as the executor of the estate in order to control the money. Which, incidentally, makes it somewhat baffling why he wanted to delay the wealthy man being declared legally dead in the first place. Apparently, he needed more time to arrange for Evelyns death.

When Mowgli and Mahala explore the jungle, they discover a hidden chamber in a ruined palace, containing fabulous wealth. Warned by an aged cobra that the wealth brings death, they leave, but Mahala takes one coin as a memento. When Buldeo sees the coin, he tries to force Mowgli to tell him where the treasure is, but Mowgli refuses. Buldeo resolves to follow Mowgli to the site of the treasure. Later Mowgli fights and kills Shere Khan, with some last minute help from Kaa, the python. As he is skinning the body, Buldeo arrives. He threatens Mowgli with a gun, but is attacked by Mowglis friend Bagheera, the black panther. Buldeo becomes convinced that Bagheera is Mowgli himself, shapeshifted into panther form. He tells the villagers that Mowgli is a witch, as is his mother. Mowgli is chained up and threatened with death, but escapes with his mothers help. However, she and another villager who tries to defend her are tied up and themselves threatened with burning for witchcraft. Mowgli is followed by the greedy Buldeo and two friends, a priest and a barber, to the lost city. They find the treasure including a golden elephant goad with a big ruby intact and leave for the village with as much as they can carry. But when they stop for the night, the priest tries to steal a jewelencrusted axe from the barbers share and murders him when the barber wakes up. The priest unconvincingly tells Buldeo that the barber had attacked him and that he had killed in selfdefense, but Buldeo knows better. The next day, the priest attacks Buldeo while his back is turned, but Buldeo knocks him into the swamp where he is killed by a crocodile. Mowgli, whod been trailing the men, tells Bagheera to chase Buldeo, the sole survivor, from the jungle, and Buldeo flees for his life, jettisoning the treasure hed been carrying. Enraged and maddened, Buldeo tries to murder Mowgli and even the jungle itself, by starting a forest fire. The fire rages, but the wind turns and threatens the village. The villagers flee, but Mowglis mother and her defender are trapped. Mowgli brings the elephants to the village and breaks open the building, escaping to the river with his mother, Mahala and other villagers. He is invited to follow them to a new life downriver, but refuses to leave the jungle, turning back to help animals trapped by the fire. The scene returns to the present day, with the elderly Buldeo telling his story and admitting that the jungle defeated his youthful dreams.

McEwen is bitten by a rattlesnake before he can board a train, where he is helped by a couple of passengers, Monte Marquez, a gambler, and Fay Hollister, a nurse. The train tracks are washed out near Albuquerque, so the small group goes off alone via a route used to deliver mail.

When they reach an Alamogordo saloon that Marquezs cousins run, a cattleman named Burnett is willing to take on McEwen as a hired hand.

Yang must discover the whereabouts and true identities of these masked warriors, and decide which, if any, he can trust to join him in his mission. The five pupils are the Centipede, Snake, Scorpion, Lizard, and Toad. Centipede, Snake, Lizard and Toad know each other, but none know the Scorpion, who always wears a mask.

Trishs middle child, Timmy, is preparing for his bar mitzvah and trying to determine what it means to become a man. Trish has for years told Timmy and Chloe that Bill had died, to avoid telling them that he is a pedophile. Timmy finds out, however, and is angry at her that she lied to him.

He begs Mark who, in Palindromes, revealed he had dealt with allegations of pedophilia for forgiveness, as he made his mistakes before his bar mitzvah an event marking the beginning of moral accountability. Mark grants him forgiveness, but notes that such gestures are meaningless. Timmy then says that all he wants is his father.

But the director duo has preferred not to show a straightforward relationship tale of these two individuals, preferring instead to use the medium of a train journey to narrate the journey of their failing relationship. The film begins with various people shown boarding a first class A.C. compartment of Jnaneshwari Express from Lokmanya Tilak Terminus, Kurla in Mumbai, the start of a long journey to Kolkata Howrah. Sudipa finds herself sharing her coupe with Malini aka Molly Aparajita Adhya and her young daughter Putul. Others in the compartment include the newly wedded couple Ajay Biswanath Basu and his wife Manali Dey, an elderly couple Soumitra Chatterjee and Sabitri Chatterjee, who are off to Kolkata as their son\u2019s family is departing to the U.S and a group of 4 musicians popular musicians in real life \u2013 Anupam Roy along with Anindya Chatterjee and Upal Sengupta of the popular band Chandrabindoo and Surojit Chatterjee who was part of another popular band, Bhoomi. In their own ways, some of the passengers seem to be having something about their past on their minds. The newly married couple briefly talk to each other about their past relationships and get on with their fondness for each other. The elderly couple is sad to leave behind their children but know that they have to move on with their own lives. One of the musicians reminisces about his association with the band that he was part of and his cofounder. And Sudipa finds herself in a spot of bother as she realizes that Malini and Putul are none other than Ujaan\u2019s present wife and daughter. Upset over the same, she clearly demonstrates that she has not completely forgiven Ujaan for whatever happened between them and seems to carry the burden of their memories. A common love for heritage and culture had seen the conservation architect from Mumbai, Sudipa fall in love with Ujaan, an explorer as he liked to call himself and someone who conducted walks of different nature all over Kolkata and nearby towns as a tourist guide. But, of course, life after marriage turned out to be unlike what they had expected leading to their eventual separation. Over the course of the 30 odd hours of the train journey, we come across not just a way of knowing how all these passengers spend their time, but also get an insight into the failed marriage of Ujaan and Sudipa. Ujaan joins them at Nagpur after driving down by road to catch the train. He is surprised to find Sudipa in the same coupe as his family. A nonlinear approach in a subtle manner is used to shift the focus on and off from the train journey to the relationship between the two individuals who started off being madly in love, only to see their marriage crumbling in front of their own eyes. They ensure that the focus is more or less only on these two individuals when their past is shown, there is a mention of Ujaan\u2019s close friend and Sudipa\u2019s parents, but they are never really shown. Even the rest of the family members of Ujaan are barely showcased in an attempt to take us through their relationship curve. Over the course of their story we also get to understand how and what went wrong in case of their marriage. Beginning with a sense of apprehension and even disgust in a way, it\u2019s wonderful to see Sudipa gradually opening up to Malini and acknowledging how wrong she was in her assumption about her. There are lots of wonderful moments in the film, like the one where the old lady complains to the railway attendant about the AC and other aspects in horrible Bangla mixed Hindi as her husband humorously points out later. Also, the way Ujaan and Sudipa manage to just about have a soulful discussion about their past and of course the interaction between Malini and Sudipa right at the end. Apart from the \u201cAntakshari\u201d sequence, there is hardly any interaction between the people on the coach. But then, this is essentially the story of Ujaan and Sudipa and their failed relationship. It\u2019s wonderful to see how welletched Malini\u2019s character is and she is the one who in a way helps bring closure in the lives of both Ujaan and Sudipa.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

When a group of CIA soldiers attempt to abduct head counselor Victor Diaz Keith Allen, Cody helps him escape, mistaking the CIA operation for a training exercise. The director informs Cody that Diaz stole disks containing plans for a secret mindcontrol device, and sends Cody to recapture him. In the United Kingdom, Cody poses as a summer orchestra student at the Kenworth estate to spy on owner Lord Duncan Kenworth, suspected of working with Diaz, supported by his handler, Derek Anthony Anderson and Kumar, Dereks righthand man, who are disguised as a chef hired by Lady Josephine Kenworth and a taxi driver respectively. Whilst keeping his mission a secret from his fellow students, Cody sneaks around the estate and confirms that Diaz and Duncan are working together and that they have a working prototype of the mind control device, evidenced when Duncan makes a dog serve drinks and play the piano. The next day, Cody breaks into a lab owned by Duncan, where he sees the finished device: a microchip inserted as a filling into a tooth cavity by dentist Santiago. Shortly afterwards Cody and Derek chase Diaz, armed with a rocket gun, through London streets, but Cody is captured by the Metropolitan Police Service and taken to Scotland Yard. He is later freed by Emily Hannah Spearritt, a fellow student who, similar to Cody, is actually a British Scotland Yard undercover operative. While Emily buys coffee and soda, henchmen sneak up on Cody, knocking him unconscious by drugging him with spray. They kidnap him and implant him with the microchip. Under Duncan, Santiago and Diazs influence, Cody meets the CIA director, who is then also converted. This is witnessed by Emily, who explains things to Derek. To get the microchip out of Cody, Derek cuts one of Codys gadgets, exploding Mentos mints, into a precisely minuscule amount to safely remove it. The group later realise Diazs plan: to implant all of the world leaders, who are all in London for a G7 summit at Buckingham Palace, effectively giving him control of the world. Deducing that with the CIA director under Diazs control, they may be put on a most wanted list, Cody, Derek and Emily infiltrate the party before the summit. There, they realize that most of the dignitaries have already been implanted due to bizarre behavior and Duncan being appointed director of the Royal Mint by the British Prime Minister upon accepting this, Duncan cruelly states to Josephine that he is leaving her. They explain the truth to the other students, who are performing for the guests, and urge them to keep the world leaders from attending the G7 summit. They later proceed to do so with an impromptu but rousing performance of War, accompanied by dancing and clapping from the assembled dignitaries and Queen Elizabeth herself, whilst Cody, Emily and Derek search for the villains. Derek is implanted with the microchip, and is set on Cody by Santiago. Before Santiago can kill him through Derek, Emily finds and subdues him, disabling the mind control software and rescuing the U.S. President, who was to be implanted. Shortly after Cody kicks out Dereks microchip, the two of them remove the CIA directors microchip. Diaz, realising that his plan has failed attempts to flee, but ends up fighting, and being defeated by Cody in the Queens gift room, destroying numerous priceless artifacts in the process. Duncan also attempts to escape, but is tripped by his apparently senile and blind butler, who turns out to be Emilys handler and is arrested, much to Lady Kenworths delight. After the villains are arrested, Cody returns to the camp, where Derek is now in charge as reward. Codys parents pick him up, none the wiser about his dangerous exploits.

At the end of the bitter quarrel, which involves Mrs. Llewellyns son Lynn and his wife Virginia Louise Henry, Virginia announces that she has decided to leave the house and go to Chicago. During the tiff, Vance and Doris Rosalind Russell, Mrs. Llewellyns secretary, are introduced to each other and Doris immediately takes a liking to Vance. Vance takes Doris to his home, where he and District Attorney Markham Purnell Pratt show her the mysterious letter. Doris immediately recognizes the return address as being that of the Llewellyns townhouse in Closter and notices that the letter was typed on her typewriter. Vance assigns Sergeant Heath Ted Healy to help stake out the casino that night, but their presence does not prevent Lynn from suddenly collapsing at the card table. At the same time, Doris informs Vance that Virginia has died at the Llewellyn house. Markham begins his investigation of the murder by questioning Mrs. Llewellyn, who recalls having quarrelled with Virginia before she was poisoned, and Amelia Isabel Jewell, Mrs. Llewellyns daughter, who admits that she too had a spat with Virginia.

Vance and Doris escape, but Vance does not believe that Kinkaid is the murderer, thinking instead that he is merely one of many decoys set up by the real killer to lead the investigation astray. The real killer turns out to be Lynn, who has lured Vance and Doris to the Closter townhouse to kill them. But before Lynn completes his perfect crime, Vance reads from a letter he wrote earlier in which he detailed his theory about the killings. In it, Vance names Lynn as the murderer, calling him a rich, egomaniacal weakling, who, being tired of his wife, poisoned her and threw the blame on his uncle, whom he despised. After hearing Vances summary of the murder plot, Lynn tells his captors that he has arranged to pin Vance and Doris forthcoming murder on Kinkaid.

They are placed under command of Colonel Rick Flag to be used as disposable assets in highrisk missions for the United States government. Each member has a nano bomb implanted in their neck, designed to detonate should any member rebel or try to escape. One of Wallers intended recruits is Flags girlfriend Dr. June Moone, an archaeologist possessed by a witch known as the Enchantress. Enchantress quickly turns on Waller, deciding to eradicate humankind with a mystical weapon for imprisoning her.

The deal is interrupted by Kirill, an agent for Russias Federal Security Service who works for oligarch Yuri Gretkov. Kirill kills everyone involved and steals the files and money, planting Bournes fingerprint at the scene. He travels to Goa to kill Bourne, but Bourne spots him and flees with Marie. Kirill shoots and kills Marie instead of Bourne. Their vehicle plunges into a river and Bourne leaves and travels to Naples. After finding Bournes fingerprint, Landy asks Deputy Director Ward Abbott about Operation Treadstone, the defunct CIA program to which Bourne belonged. She tells Abbott that the CIA agent who stole the 20 million was named in the Neski files. Some years previously, Russian politician Vladimir Neski was about to identify the thief when he was murdered by his wife in a Berlin hotel. Landy believes that Bourne and Treadstones late supervisor, Alexander Conklin, were somehow involved and that Bourne killed her two agents. Both Abbott and Landy go to Berlin to capture Bourne. In Naples, Bourne allows himself to be identified by security. He subdues his CIA interrogator and copies the SIM card from his cell phone. From the subsequent phone call, he learns about Landy and the frameup. Bourne goes to Munich to visit Jarda, the only other remaining Treadstone operative. Jarda informs Bourne that Treadstone was shut down after Conklins death, and tries to incapacitate him. Bourne kills Jarda and escapes before the CIA arrives.

Bourne kidnaps Nicky at the meetup in Alexanderplatz, and learns from her that Abbott was the head of Treadstone, not Conklin.

Bourne then visits the hotel where the killing took place and recalls more of his mission\u2014he killed Neski on Conklins orders, and when Neskis wife showed up, he shot her to make it look like a murder\u2013suicide. Danny Zorn, Conklins former assistant, suspects that Bourne was not involved. He explains his theory to Abbott, who kills him. Bourne breaks into Abbotts hotel room and records a conversation between him and Gretkov that incriminates them in the theft of the 20 million. Abbott admits to Bourne that he stole the money, ordered Bourne to murder Neski, ordered Kirill to retrieve the files, and have Bourne framed and silenced in Goa. Abbott expects Bourne to kill him, but Bourne, thinking of Marie, refuses, leaving his gun on the table. After Bourne leaves, Landy confronts Abbott about her suspicions and he commits suicide. Later, Landy returns to her hotel room where she finds an envelope containing the tape of Abbotts conversations with Gretkov and Bourne. Listening to the tape, she realizes that Bourne is now vindicated. Bourne goes to Moscow to find Vladimir Neskis daughter, Irena. Kirill, tasked once again by Gretkov with killing Bourne, finds and wounds him. Bourne flees in a stolen taxi and Kirill chases him.

Naani angrily objects, to which he is kicked down once before being sent home. The next day, Naani goes to Devrus residence to pay off his loans. As he is exiting, Naani suffers an impact to the head from Devru swinging a rod at him. Suzie Shraddha Srinath wakes up suddenly, as what she had just felt was a recurring bad dream. Daisy Shweta Pandit comforts her and tells her to get ready, as they work in a brothel and have to satisfy the desires of men coming in. Daisys younger sister Rashmi comes out to dance with them, where a womanizer wishes for her before the brothels owner Bobby Bhavani Prakash angrily denies him. Afterwards, Daisy scolds Rashmi for coming out when she shouldnt have. Later that night, a graffiti artist by the name of Rooney Madukar Niyogi barely escapes from the police and sneaks into the brothel, where Suzie falls in love with him. Devru is walking with his daughter Shwetha Ananya Bhat when they meet Shwethas friend and senior, Asha Shruthi Hariharan. After a brief introduction, Asha goes with her boyfriend Prakash Prabhu Mundkar to a coffee shop, where they discuss their future together. Later, Asha is studying at the library when she realizes that it is almost closing time. Before she leaves, she finds an abandoned purse next to her with a significant amount of money. As she is heading home, a man approaches her, asking her if she had seen a purse. She happily returns the purse to him and asks him to verify that the correct amount is there, to which the man exclaims that there is money missing. The two argue and go to the police station, where an FIR is submitted against Asha. Asha begs for the FIR to not be submitted on the promise that she will give the missing amount to the man in two days time. When Asha has the money, she is told to meet the man at a hostel; the police conduct a raid on this hostel for prostitutes, and Asha is mistaken for one and is detained. Asha is bailed out only to be held at the same brothel where Daisy and Suzie are, on the orders of Devru, as she needs to stay there for a week before she can be trafficked. It is also revealed that after Devru hit Naani, he and his henchmen dragged him to the shore and beat him more, before Devru raped and killed Naanis eldest daughter.

One day a storm forces her husband Gerardo Wilson to ride home with a charming stranger. She is convinced that the stranger, Dr. Miranda Kingsley, was part of the old regime and that he tortured and raped her for weeks while she was blindfolded. Paulina takes him captive to determine the truth. Despite attempts by both her husband and Miranda to convince her that he is innocent, Paulina is certain that he is the one, and forces her husband to be Mirandas attorney in the trial she arranges for him. Miranda conspires with Gerardo to agree to a false confession as Paulina states thats all she wants in exchange for his life, so they write one up and present it to Paulina. Enraged, Paulina deems Miranda as being unrepentant, and threatens to kill him. As Gerardo tries to stop her, Miranda succeeds in getting Paulinas gun, and threatens to kill her if he is not freed. As he advances toward the door, Paulina hits him and after a struggle gets back in control. In a lastditch effort to save his life, Miranda implores Gerardo to call the Spanish medical school where he claims to have been at the time of Paulinas rape, as she leads him blindfolded out the door to the edge of the cliff. Gerardo contacts the school, where Mirandas colleague seems to confirm the story. He races to inform Paulina, at last convinced that Miranda is innocent. Paulina refuses to believe it, however, saying that the doctors at that time created alibis in order to conceal their identities. Accepting defeat, Miranda finally tells them that he really was the doctor, that he enjoyed brutalizing Paulina, and that he was sorry that the old regime fell. Enraged, Gerardo attempts to throw Miranda from the cliff, only to realize he cannot bring himself to take a life. Paulina apparently accepts the confession, and they both leave Miranda on the cliff as he stares down at the water. The camera simulates someone falling off the cliff as seen from his own point of view. In the final scene, Paulina and Gerardo are at the same concert where the film began with Miranda also present, looking down with his wife and sons.

Howard Dahlman Dan Gachman, a rich businessman and ardent amateur space program enthusiast, went into the Mexican jungle to recover the satellite but never returned. His wife Carol Kathleen Crowley sets out to find him. Arriving in Campeche, Mexico, Carol meets two jungle guides, the illtempered Dave Hollister Arthur Franz and his drunken but goodhearted brother Matt Robert Brown. When she asks their help, Dave refuses, citing the coming rainy season. But he changes his mind after Carol gives in to his extravagant demand for 7,000 each for him and Matt if Howard is alive or 10 percent of his estate if hes dead. Dave asks Carol which is more important to her, Howard or the money from his estate. She hesitates before saying unconvincingly that she wants to find her husband alive. Carol, Dave, Matt and their native porters head into the jungle with a copy of Howards map. It shows the route he took to the X117 crash site, 200 miles from Campeche. In the jungle, they find a burned skeleton. Dave examines it and tells Carol that its not Howard. Dave asks if she loves Howard. Carol says that she doesnt know, and that perhaps this is what shes trying to learn on the expedition. In return, Dave says that he too had had an unhappy marriage. At their camp, Dave, Matt and the porters bring in a badly burned tribesman. Dave attempts to treat him, but the man dies. The porters say that the God of Fire is responsible. To everyones shock, the mans body suddenly bursts into flames, leaving a skeleton similar to the one theyd found earlier. Despite the rigors of the trek, Carol and Daves mutual attraction grows. They kiss passionately later that night. One by one the porters run off, leaving Carol, Dave and Matt on their own. They soon find Howards abandoned camp. It has solar power and, surprisingly, the chimp from the satellite is there. Carol says that shes now convinced that Howard is dead, but Dave says that they must find Howards body to legally prove it. A tribesman appears and takes them to the cave where he says the God of Fire lives. Inside the cave, they find X117 surrounded by an alien blob, out of which Howards perfectly preserved head protrudes. But the chimp disintegrates as it approaches the blob, which itself is surrounded by a deadly invisible electric field. Dave and Matt calculate that the blob doubles in size every two hours. At that rate, it will expand out of the cave and overtake them if they try to outrun it. Their only chance is to destroy it inside the cave. Dave notices that X117 is sitting on two veins of metallic ore. He says that if they connect a solar battery to both veins, they can perhaps electrocute the blob and kill it. But by the time theyve prepared everything, they have only eight minutes before the blob again doubles. Matt climbs to the vein above the blob. Unfortunately, theyve miscalculated and the blob suddenly begins to expand. Matt dives into the blob, sacrificing himself, but giving Dave just enough time to electrocute it.

The ghosts haunt houses so Frank can then exorcise them for a fee. Most locals consider him a con man. Soon after Frank cons local health nut Ray Lynskey and his wife Lucy, a physician, Ray dies of a heart attack. Frank discovers there is an entity, appearing as the Grim Reaper, killing people, first marking numbers on their foreheads that only Frank sees. Debra had a similar number when she was found. Franks ability to foretell the murders puts him under suspicion with the police and FBI agent Milton Dammers, who is convinced Frank is responsible. Frank is arrested for killing newspaper editor Magda ReesJones, who had attacked him in the press. It was actually the Grim Reaper who killed ReesJones, despite Franks attempts to prevent it. Lucy investigates the murders and becomes a target of the Grim Reaper. She is attacked while visiting Frank in jail; but they escape with the help of Cyrus and Stuart, who are both dissolved in the process. Frank wants to commit suicide to stop the Grim Reaper. Lucy helps Frank have a neardeath experience by putting him into hypothermia and using barbiturates to stop his heart. Dammers abducts Lucy, revealing that he had been a victim of Charles Manson and his Family in 1969. In his ghostly form, Frank confronts the Grim Reaper and discovers that he is the ghost of Johnny Bartlett, a psychiatric hospital orderly who killed twelve people 30 years earlier, before being captured, convicted and executed. Newspaper reports reveal that his greatest desire was to become the most prolific serial killer ever, showing pride at killing more than contemporaries like Charles Starkweather.

Out of bullets, Patricia strangles Frank to death, but Frank in spirit form rips Patricias spirit from her body, forcing Bartlett to follow them. Bartlett grabs Patricias ghost, while Frank makes it to Heaven, where he is reunited with Cyrus and Stuart, along with his wife Debra.

His eternally optimistic demeanor conceals the fact his snowmobile dealership is on the verge of bankruptcy due to an unusually warm winter. His friend Gig Tim Roth, a shady strip club owner, suggests an insurance scam will free Russ of his financial problems, but when the scheme fails to pay off, Russ finds himself even deeper in debt and the target of a hitman named Dale Michael Rapaport. Gig then proposes Russ rig the Pennsylvania Lottery with the help of his amoral girlfriend Crystal Latroy Lisa Kudrow, a ditzy model who pulls and announces the winning numbers on television, and her oddball cousin Walter Michael Moore, who will pose as the owner of the lucky ticket. Their plan works, but before the 6.4 million jackpot can be claimed, everything begins to unravel. First, Walter gets greedy, refuses to hand the winning ticket over to his cousin and Crystals physical confrontation triggers Walters ultimately fatal asthma attack. Sleazy station manager Dick Simmons Ed ONeill, who also is sleeping with Crystal, tries to blackmail her and Russ when he discovers what they have done, and others who have uncovered what appears to be the worst kept secret in town demand their share as well. Mayhem and murder ensue, prompting lazy detectives Lakewood Bill Pullman and Chambers Daryl Mitchell to initiate an investigation they hope will not be too taxing. Russ decides to sell the ticket to Dick for 100,000 to get clear of the debt he owes to Dale. Crystal is irate, and she immediately seduces Dick to get back into her share of the winnings. Dale breaks into Dicks house and tries to rob the ticket from him, but the police arrive, and Lakewood ends up killing him. On his way home, Lakewood comes across Russ who has jackknifed and overturned an 18wheeler as he tries to unload his snowmobile inventory on another dealer. Fearing Lakewood has come to arrest him, Russ flees with his 100,000 on a snowmobile but crashes into a tree. At the hospital, Lakewood gives him a ticket for operating the snowmobile without a license and explains what happened to Dick and Dale. Russ goes to Dicks hospital room and steals the lottery ticket back. He gives it to Wendy the waitress from Dennys Maria Bamford and moves to Florida where he becomes a successful host of a gameshow called Lucky Numbers.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

Uther Pendragon, king of the Britons, infiltrates Mordreds lair and beheads him, saving Camelot. Uthers treacherous younger brother Vortigern, who covets the throne, orchestrates a coup and sacrifices his wife Elsa to moat hags to become a demon knight, who kills Uthers wife and slays him in combat. The only survivor is Uthers son, who drifts away in a boat and ends up in Londinium, where he is found and raised by prostitutes. Arthur grows into a skilled fighter and man of the streets. Arthur and his friends confront a group of Vikings who had mistreated one of the prostitutes, forcing him to pay her restitution. Afterwards, the brothel is raided by the Blacklegs, Vortigerns minions, and Arthur learns that the Vikings were under the kings protection. Arthur tries to escape the city but is caught and put on a ship with hundreds of other men; the Blacklegs have been forcing all men of Arthurs age to try to pull a sword that has appeared near the castle from the surrounding stone. Arthur is able to remove the sword but is quickly overwhelmed by its power and passes out. Vortigern meets with him in the dungeon, revealing his true lineage. Meanwhile, a mage identifying herself as an acolyte of Merlin presents herself to Uthers former general, Sir Bedivere. At Arthurs planned execution, the mage uses her magic to stage a diversion while Bediveres men rescue Arthur. Taken to Bediveres hideout, Arthur initially refuses to help them. The mage persuades Bedivere to take Arthur to a realm called the Darklands, where hes given a vision of how Uther sacrificed himself to save Arthur and entomb the sword in stone. Arthur learns Vortigern was responsible for persuading Mordred to rebel against humanity, and he returns determined to destroy Vortigern. With his friends and Bediveres men, Arthur stages a series of ambushes against Vortigern, culminating in an assassination attempt in Londinium. The rebels sense a trap but attack anyway, fleeing to a fighters school run by Arthurs mentor George, where they are overrun by the Blacklegs. Seeing the mage held at knifepoint, Arthur unleashes Excaliburs potential, singlehandedly killing all of the soldiers. The rebels are able to escape the city except for Arthurs injured friend Back Lack, who is killed at Vortigerns hand in front of his son Blue. Ashamed of his failures, Arthur tries to throw away the sword, but the Lady of the Lake returns it and shows him a vision of Englands future under Vortigerns rule. Coming to terms with his responsibility, Arthur reunites with Bedivere. When they return to the rebel hideout, however, they discover all of their allies dead, Vortigern having found them and delivered an ultimatum: if Arthur does not surrender himself, the captured mage and Blue will die. Arthur surrenders himself, but as Vortigern is about to execute his nephew, a giant snake summoned by the mage attacks and devours Vortigerns men. While Bedivere and the others lead an attack on the castle, a desperate Vortigern sacrifices his only daughter and is transformed into the demon knight, confronting Arthur in a separate dimension. Despite his fighting skill, Arthur is beaten, and he is about to submit when he witnesses a vision of his father, convincing him to accept the sword and his character as his own. Arthur violently slays Vortigern but blesses him as he dies. In the aftermath, Arthur dissolves Vortigerns pact with the Vikings and begins building a Round Table where his knighted friends will meet.

At 3 a.m., a team of heavily armed LAPD officers ambush and kill six members of the gang. Later, the gangs four warlords swear a blood oath of revenge against the police and the citizens of Los Angeles. During the day, three sequences of events occur parallel to one another: First, Lieutenant Ethan Bishop, a newly promoted CHP officer, is assigned to take charge of the decommissioned Anderson police precinct during the last few hours before it is permanently closed. The station is manned by a skeleton staff composed of Sergeant Chaney and the stations two secretaries, Leigh and Julie. Across town, two of the Street Thunder warlords, along with two other gang members, drive around the neighborhood looking for people to kill. One of the warlords shoots and kills a little girl, Kathy, and the driver of an icecream truck. Kathys father, Lawson, pursues and kills the warlord and the other gang members chase him into the Anderson precinct. In shock, Lawson is unable to communicate to Bishop or Chaney what has happened to him. Just before this, a prison bus commanded by Starker stops at the station to find medical help for one of three prisoners being transported to the state prison. The prisoners are Napoleon Wilson, Wells, and Caudell, who is sick. As the prisoners are put into cells, the telephone lines go dead, and when Starker prepares to put the prisoners back on the bus, the gang opens fire on the precinct, using weapons fitted with silencers. In seconds, they kill Chaney, the bus driver, Caudell, Starker, and the two officers along with Starker. Bishop unchains Wilson from Starkers body and puts Wilson and Wells back into the cells. When the gang members cut the stations electricity and begin a second wave of shooting, Bishop sends Leigh to release Wells and Wilson, and they help Bishop and Leigh repel an attempted invasion, though Julie is killed in the firefight. Meanwhile, the gang members remove all evidence of the skirmish in order to avoid attracting outside attention. Bishop hopes that someone has heard the police weapons firing, but the neighborhood is too sparsely populated for nearby residents to pinpoint the location of the noise. Wells is chosen to sneak out of the precinct through the sewer line and hotwire a car, but is killed by a gang member hiding in the backseat. However, two police officers responding to reports of gunfire find the dead body of a telephone repairman hanging from a pole near the police station, and call for backup. As the gang rallies for an allout final assault, Wilson, Leigh, and Bishop retreat to the basement, taking the stillcatatonic Lawson with them. Protected by a large durable sign, the gang then storms the building and rush the survivors. Bishop shoots a tank full of acetylene gas, which explodes and kills all the gang members in the basement. The remaining gang members retreat as more police support arrives to secure the station. Venturing down into the basement, the police officers find dozens of badly burned and killed gang members strewn about the hallway; the only survivors are Bishop, Leigh, Wilson, and Lawson.

First, he and his treacherous partner Zepp Paul Stewart have received draft notices to join the army in preparation for World War II. Fortunately, he has a solution. One of his underlings, Joe Bascopolous, has just died, and his status was 4F unfit to serve. So one of them can dodge the draft by assuming his identity. They gamble for it; Zepp cheats, but Joe still wins. Zepp fails his physical examination anyway. The other problem is a lack of money to bankroll his gambling ship. He talks the head of the local War Relief organization, Captain Veronica Steadman Gladys Cooper, into authorizing him to run a charity casino, promising to raise enough money to outfit a relief ship, despite the suspicions of her lieutenant, wealthy socialite Dorothy Bryant Laraine Day. Eventually, he even charms Dorothy. She tells her snobbish grandfather Henry Stephenson, to his great dismay, that Joes the first man Ive ever met Im afraid of. Its exciting. At one point, Joe teaches Dorothy Australian rhyming slang, for example, tit for tat hat, twist and twirl girl, storm and strife wife. Later, he renames his gambling ship the Briny Marlin darling in her honor. On the day of the charity ball, Joe receives a letter addressed to Bascopolous. Curious, he takes it to a Greek Orthodox priest for translation. It turns out to be from Bascopolouss mother in Axisoccupied Greece. She wrote to tell her son that when German paratroopers invaded their village, under his brothers leadership, every man and boy fought to the death. Moved, Joe sits on a park bench, reexamining his life. At the ball, Joes men use false bottoms in the cashboxes to steal most of the money. Joe has a change of heart and tells his righthand man, the Crunk Alan Carney, that the money is going to war relief. But Zepp overhears and forces him at gunpoint to collect the loot. Dorothy accidentally catches them in the act and thinks Joe is a willing participant. To protect her, he is forced to knock her out. Then, the two men start collecting the money. When Zepp briefly looks away, Joe attacks and kills him, but not before getting shot. Joe escapes, leaving behind a trail of blood. Then, he sends the money back to Dorothy via his trusted friend Swede. He loads his ship with the charitys supplies. Later, Dorothy is stricken when a policeman informs her Bascopolous is dead. Then she sees the photograph of the man; it is not her Joe. When the name of the ship Bascopolous worked on is mentioned, she rushes to the dock, just as the ship is leaving for Europe. She begs Joe to take her with him, but he tells her she deserves better and turns away to hide his own anguish. The ship is torpedoed and sunk on the return trip. Dorothy visits the pier each night. The flashback ends. Hoping Dorothy would be present, Swede arranges for Joe to meet him there. When Joe shows up at the other end of the pier, he wants to go out on the town to celebrate their last night in port rather than going back to their ship. Thinking quickly, the guard tells him he cannot leave the dinghy tied up where it is. The watchman settles who has to move it by flipping a coin, assigning Swede heads. Joe loses.

Years later, in 1909, Maurice is attending Cambridge, where he strikes up a friendship with two fellow students: the aristocratic Lord Risley and the rich and handsome Clive Durham. Durham falls in love with his friend and surprises Maurice by confessing his feelings. At first, Maurice does not react favorably to the revelation. He soon realizes that he reciprocates Durhams feelings. The two friends embark on a love affair but, at Clives insistence, their relationship remains nonsexual. To go further, in Durhams opinion, would diminish them both. Clive, a member of the upper class, has a promising future ahead of him and does not want to risk losing his social position. Their close relationship continues after Maurice is expelled from Cambridge and begins a new career as a stockbroker in London. The two friends keep their feelings secret, but are frightened when Lord Risley is arrested and sentenced to six months at hard labour after soliciting sex from a soldier. Clive, afraid of being exposed as a homosexual, breaks with Maurice. After his return from a trip to Greece, Clive, under pressure from his widowed mother, marries a naive rich girl named Anne and settles into a life of rural domesticity. Heartbroken, Maurice seeks the help of his family physician, Dr. Barry, who dismisses Maurices doubts as rubbish. Maurice then turns to Dr. LaskerJones, who tries to cure his homosexual longings with hypnosis. During his visits to Clives estate of Pendersleigh, Maurice attracts the attention of Alec Scudder, the undergamekeeper who is due to emigrate with his brother to Argentina. Maurice not only fails to notice Scudders interest in him, but initially treats him with contempt. This does not discourage Scudder, who spies on Maurice at night. Simcox, the butler at Pendersleigh, suspecting the true nature of Maurice and Clives past relationship, has hinted to Scudder about Maurices nature. On a rainy night, Scudder boldly climbs a ladder and enters Maurices bedroom through an open window. Scudder kisses Maurice, who is completely taken by surprise, but does not resist his advances. After their first night together, Maurice receives a letter from Scudder proposing they meet at the Pendersleigh boathouse. Maurice wrongly believes that Scudder is blackmailing him. Maurice returns to LaskerJones, who warns Maurice that England is a country which has always been disinclined to accept human nature and advises he emigrate to a country where homosexuality is no longer criminal, like France or Italy. When Maurice fails to appear at the boathouse, Scudder travels to London and visits him at his offices. Maurice and Scudder meet at the British Museum and the blackmail misunderstanding is resolved. Maurice begins to call Scudder by his first name, Alec. They spend the night together at a hotel room, and as Alec departs in the morning he explains that his departure for Argentina is imminent and they will not see each other again. Maurice goes to the port to give Alec a parting gift only to discover that Alec has missed the sailing. Maurice goes to Pendersleigh and confesses to Clive his love for Alec. Clive, who was hoping that Maurice would marry, is bewildered at Maurices account of his encounters with Alec. The two friends separate and Maurice goes to the boathouse looking for Alec, who is there waiting for him. Scudder tells him that he sent a telegram to Maurice stating that he was to come to the boathouse.

Dil quickly becomes a very spoiled baby, crying nonstop for attention, keeping all of the toys for himself, and refusing to share with Tommy. After a nasty fight between Tommy and Dil over Tommys teddy bear, Tommys father, Stu has a conversation with him about being a big brother and the responsibility he now has, assuring him that one day he will be happy to have Dil as his little brother. He also gives Tommy a locket with a picture of Tommy and Dil taped together and a watch inside, which he calls his sponsitility his term for responsibility. When Dil pushes the other babies too far, they decide to take him back to the hospital despite Tommys disapproval, and end up driving recklessly through the streets in a Reptar Wagon which Stu had built for a contest.

Tommy eventually finds Dil during a storm, and are forced to take shelter under a tree. But as Tommy tries to take care of him, Dil selfishly drinks all of the milk and keeps the large blanket for himself, which leads to the blanket tearing in half and Tommy falling into a puddle of mud. Tommy finally snaps and nearly pours banana baby food on Dil for the monkeys to take him away, but Tommys rage and the storms lightning and thunder scare Dil so much that he sees the error of his ways.

Believing he is the lizard, the babies wish for Spike back instead of going home. Stu falls through the bridge and finds Spike, who actually survived the fall. The babies are then reunited with their families, and the monkeys with their circus owners. The monkeys attack Rex Pester, much to Bettys amusement. The families return home and the babies accept Dil as one of the group.

Unfortunately, the trip from Moon City on the nearside would take six days by a lunar vehicle.

Among these officers are NYPD officers Murphy and Corelli, who work out of the 41st precinct, nicknamed Fort Apache because to those who work there, it feels like an army outpost in foreign territory. The streets are filled with dangerous gangs, criminals, and drug dealers. Unemployment is very high and the neighborhood is filled with garbage and wrecked buildings. While Murphy is a harddrinking and lonely divorced father, he has a great camaraderie with Corelli. As well, Murphys life improves when he meets a young nurse, Isabella, and they start a romantic relationship. The precinct is one of the worst and most dilapidated in the entire department, approaching demolition and staffed mostly by officers who are unwanted by, and have been transferred out of, other precincts. Additionally, the precincts officers dont represent the large Puerto Rican community, as only 4 of the officers are Hispanic in the largest nonEnglish speaking section of the Bronx. Corelli and Murphy attempt to maintain law and order by catching pimps and robbers, but they have conflicts with corrupt fellow officers, and a newly appointed police captain, Connolly. There is rioting due to alleged police brutality, as well as issues related to the deaths of two rookie cops, who were shot by a drug addict at the films beginning. During the riot, Murphy and Corelli witness an officer throwing an innocent teenager off an apartment roof to his death. As Murphy becomes more intimate with Isabella, they begin a sexual relationship. While she is sleeping, Murphy notices track marks on her skin. She later admits that she uses heroin as a way to relax from working in such a stressful environment. She tells him that other hospital employees also use heroin. Illustrating the futility of policing in the precinct, the killer of the two cops is never found, despite mass arrests and interrogations. The drug addict who killed them is later also killed and her body is shown as an anonymous bundle dumped in roadside trash. Murphy is broken when Isabella dies from a drug overdose and wrestles with the moral question of whether he should maintain the blue code and not inform authorities about the officer who threw the teen off the roof. Murphy decides to resign and report the killing, a decision that will make other officers hate him and view him as a stool pigeon. Murphy seems to be on the verge of quitting the force, when he sees a purse snatcher rob a person and flee.

The posse, led by local sheriff July Johnson and deputy Roscoe Bookbinder, chases the fugitives across the Mexican border into territory policed by bandoleros, whom Maria describes as men out to kill any gringos foreigners that they can find. Maria further warns Dee that the sheriff will follow, because they have taken the one thing that he has always wanted: her. Despite initial protestations, Maria falls for Dee and finds herself in a quandary. She had never felt anything for the sheriff, nor for her husband, who had purchased her from her family. The posse tracks them to an abandoned town and captures the gang. The bandoleros also arrive, shooting and killing Roscoe, so the sheriff releases the outlaws so that the men can fight back in defense. In this final showdown, almost everyone is killed. Dee is fatally stabbed by the leader of the bandits, El Jefe, after savagely beating him when he attempts to rape Maria. Then Mace is shot by another.

Furthermore, the executor believes the woman is in New York City, not Denver, where uncle Henry died. J. C. decides to look for Florie Ona Monsun himself, so he can better keep the news from her.

The family, with the exception of Angela, pitch in. Soon, even Angela is helping out. Meanwhile, two private detectives are closing in. When they show up at the house, they are lied to, but the detectives are not fooled and set about getting a search warrant. That night Marchaund alludes to the situation, implicitly comparing the familys deception to Jacob Marleys misdeeds in Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol before passing out from too much drink. All of the Pidgeons are ashamed of themselves and finally confess everything to Florie. Later, Marchaund wakes up and departs, leaving a note explaining his divided loyalties.

Ruth gets into a scuffle with the owner when he demands she pay for the stolen silverware. After he breaks her finger, Tony knocks him unconscious, and they flee. After Ruth becomes frustrated that she was not able to confront the youth she suspects to be the burglar, Tony reveals that he caught the license plate number on the van he rode away in. Tony researches the tag number of the van online, revealing the owner of the van and possible thief as Christian Rumack. After again receiving no help from Bendix, Ruth and Tony impersonate cops at the address belonging to the van where a woman named Meredith lets them inside and answers their questions regarding Christian Rumack and the van. She reveals that the owner of the van, her husband Chris, is not the one who uses the van; it is instead her stepson, who was given the van by his father. She says Christian became disowned by his father after being jailed for drugrelated offenses and befriending criminals he met there. Chris senior returns home abruptly with his bodyguard. Despite Chris offering a payoff, Ruth merely states that she has no interest in money and only wants to confront Christian about his behavior. Chris taunts her for her idealism and kicks them out. Christian and his friends, Marshall and Dez, watch from the side, calling off their intended robbery of Chris and instead send Christian to confront Ruth about what she knows about them. He surprises her inside her home, and she crushes his windpipe in selfdefense. As he staggers into the street, a bus strikes and kills him. Marshall and Dez kidnap Ruth, forcing her to take Christians place in their heist. Ruth gains them entry into the mansion, where Meredith and Cesar are held at gunpoint and told to summon Chris. Dez shoots Chris in the hand after he comes downstairs. Cesar attempts to shoot Marshall, who fires back at him. As the two fight, Cesar is shot in the neck and dies. Marshall demands that Chris open their safe. Marshall opens it to find that there is no cash inside, only documents. Marshall and Dez proclaim that they are done here. Tony arrives and strikes Dez in the face with a throwing ninja star. When Dez tries to fire her gun at Tony, it backfires and explodes, blowing her hand off. Chris takes the opportunity to try to steal Marshalls gun, but Marshall accidentally shoots him through the head, killing him. Marshall points his gun at Tony next, but Ruth wrestles him to the ground. Dez stabs Tony several times in the stomach. Marshalls gun goes off as Ruth fights him, and a stray bullet strikes Dez in the head, killing her. Ruth gains the upper hand over Marshall, bludgeoning him in the head and leg with the butt of his own gun, and helps Tony flee into the forest behind the mansion. Marshall recovers and chases them. Ruth hides a severely injured Tony under some foliage and continues to run from Marshall. Ruth attacks Marshall by throwing rocks at him, and his sudden movements cause him to be bitten by a water moccasin. Ruth leaves him to die from his wounds. Panicked that she cannot find Tony on her way back, Ruth sees her grandmothers ghost point her in the correct direction. Grateful that Ruth saved her life, Meredith neglects to identify her as one of the burglars to Bendix. Ruth returns to her daily life with Tony, who survives his wounds, and she joins his church.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.

While watching an opera with his parents, Thomas and Martha, Bruce becomes frightened by performers masquerading as bats and asks to leave. Outside, mugger Joe Chill murders Bruces parents in front of him. Orphaned, Bruce is raised by the family butler, Alfred Pennyworth. Fourteen years later, Chill is freed in exchange for testifying against Gotham City mafia boss Carmine Falcone. Bruce intends to murder Chill, but one of Falcones assassins does so first. Bruces childhood friend, Assistant District Attorney Rachel Dawes, berates him for attempting to undermine the justice system, saying that his father would be ashamed. Bruce confronts Falcone, who tells him that real power comes from being feared. Bruce decides to travel the world and learn how to confront injustice. While serving a prison sentence for theft in Bhutan, he meets Henri Ducard, who trains him as a member of the League of Shadows, led by Ras al Ghul. After completing his training and purging his fears, Bruce learns that the League intends to destroy Gotham, believing it to be corrupt, decadent, hypocritical and beyond saving. Bruce rejects the Leagues cause and burns down their temple during his escape. Ras is killed by falling debris, while Bruce saves the unconscious Ducard. Bruce returns to Gotham intent on fighting crime. Inspired by his childhood fear, he takes up the vigilante identity of Batman and sets up a base in the caves beneath Wayne Manor. He takes an interest in his familys company, Wayne Enterprises, now run by the unscrupulous William Earle. Company archivist Lucius Fox allows Bruce access to prototype defense technologies, including a protective bodysuit and a heavily armored car, the Tumbler. Bruce poses as a shallow playboy to allay suspicion. Batman intercepts a drug shipment, provides Rachel with evidence against Falcone, and enlists Sergeant James Gordon, one of the few honest cops left in Gotham, to arrest him. In the prison, Falcone meets Dr. Jonathan Crane, a corrupt psychiatrist whom he has helped smuggle drugs into Gotham, and threatens to reveal his complicity if he does not declare him mentally unfit for trial. Crane puts on a scarecrow mask and sprays Falcone with a fearinducing hallucinogen that drives him insane which causes Falcone to constantly mouth the word Scarecrow, and has him transferred to Arkham Asylum. While investigating the Scarecrow, Batman is exposed to the hallucinogen and left incapacitated. He is saved by Alfred and given an antidote developed by Fox. When Rachel accuses Crane of corruption, Crane reveals that he has been pouring his fearinducing drug into Gothams water supply. He drugs Rachel with it, but Batman saves her and subdues Crane, who claims to work for Ras al Ghul. Batman evades the police to get Rachel to safety, administers the antidote, and gives her a vial of it for Gordon and another for mass production. Ducard reappears at Bruces birthday party and reveals himself to be the true Ras al Ghul. Having stolen a powerful microwave emitter from Wayne Enterprises, he plans to vaporize Gothams water supply, rendering Cranes drug airborne and causing mass hysteria that will destroy the city. He sets Wayne Manor aflame and leaves Bruce to die, but Alfred rescues him. Ras loads the microwave emitter onto Gothams monorail system, intending to release the drug as the train travels toward the citys central water source. Batman rescues Rachel from a drugged mob and indirectly reveals his identity to her. He pursues Ras onto the monorail and fights him just as Gordon uses the Tumblers cannons to destroy a section of the track. Batman refuses to kill Ras, but also chooses not to save him, gliding from the train and leaving Ras aboard as it crashes and explodes, killing him. Bruce gains Rachels respect but loses her love, as she decides she cannot be with him while he is Batman. Bruce buys a controlling stake in the now publicly traded Wayne Enterprises, fires Earle, and replaces him with Fox. Gordon is promoted to Lieutenant of the Gotham City Police Department, shows Batman the BatSignal, and mentions a criminal who leaves Joker playing cards at crime scenes. Batman promises to investigate, and disappears into the night.", "category": "Story Composition 142.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, five ordered key facts are given.
