Could you please describe the meaning of these two words? What is it common between them, and what is it different? I have removed \"software UI\" from the title, as it seems to lead answers off topic. I'm genuinely interested in subtle difference in meaning of named words. \nAnswer: Options refers to things you may choose;you may select one over another. So, the options you chose are \"preferences\". Settings mostly implies the \"context\" that the options you chose are in and is more like configuration. E.g; Color is \"setting\"; red, green, blue e.t.c are options. Font is \"setting\"; Arial, Times New roman are options. Settings: color, font.", "output": "yes", "category": "Answerability Classification 854.json"}, {"instruction": "Given the Question and Answer pair, detect whether the answer is acceptable or not.

I couldn't understand why and wondered what the correct plural of \"training\" would be. Online Dictionaries/Thesaurus don't answer it, so it's probably another opinion-based statement. I haven't found a source to back it up, though. \nAnswer: Training is both countable and uncountable. Usually, referring to a process, it is uncountable and has no plural. It is sometimes used to mean \"a specific training event\", and is then countable, and has the plural \"trainings\". The OED has examples of this use going back to 1578, with the plural recorded from 1598.", "output": "yes", "category": "Answerability Classification 854.json"}, {"instruction": "Given the Question and Answer pair, detect whether the answer is acceptable or not.

Consider this note on usage from the Oxford Dictionaries: The words egoism and egotism are frequently confused, as though interchangeable, but there are distinctions worth noting. Both words derive from Latin ego ('I'), the first-person singular pronoun. Egotism, the more commonly used term , denotes an excessive sense of self-importance, too-frequent use of the word 'I,' and general arrogance and boastfulness. Egoism, a more subtle term , is perhaps best left to ethicists, for whom it denotes a view or theory of moral behavior in which self-interest is the root of moral conduct. An egoist, then , might devote considerable attention to introspection, but could be modest about it, whereas an egotist would have an exaggerated sense of the importance of his or her self-analysis, and would have to tell everyone.", "output": "yes", "category": "Answerability Classification 854.json"}]
