Whipping cream is not just fat and water mixed, it is fat and water emulsified. This is a big difference. If you had some special reason to do this on a regular basis, you could get it to work by adding emulsifiers. You can beat any fat with water and lecithine or xanthan and get a creamy result. As far as I know, this is how plant based cream substitutes work. But if the issue is that you just don't have whipping cream right now at home, then it is easier to go buy whipping cream than to go find emulsifiers (I buy mine online, don't know if there are brick-and-mortar B2C stores which sell them). If for some reason you absolutely can't do it in time, I would suggest using a different filling. Pastry cream works well with millefeulle, buttercream can work too, lightened with whipped eggwhites if necessary.  <sep>  Q: Could I add butter to single cream to make whipped/double cream? A: it won't work  Q: If I added butter to single cream and whipped it, would that add enough butterfat to it to make it suitable for whipping? A: Whipping cream is not just fat and water mixed, it is fat and water emulsified  Q: What is the best way to make whipping cream from cream? A: you could get it to work by adding emulsifiers  Q: What are good emulsifiers to add to single cream, if I want to make whipping cream? A: lecithine or xanthan  <sep> FOLLOWUP_Q: What are some sources of lecithine and xanthan?", "output": "I buy mine online, don't know if there are brick-and-mortar B2C stores which sell them", "category": "Question Answering 560.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph about cooking, and a set of conversational question answers about the paragraph, answer a follow-up question from the paragraph.

If you cook it too long or too fast, that is what will happen.If you must use the Kraft stuff (personally, I think it has no flavour compared to real Reggiano), try melting the cheese on low heat in a very small amount of cream first, before you add it to the main sauce pan. If it's still gritty, either it's curdling or you need to use a better cheese.  <sep>  Q: How can I make cheap, smooth homemade Alfredo sauce?
