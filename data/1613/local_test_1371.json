A situation of high pressure in the spinal cord compared to low pressure outside, leads to fluid accumulation, which eventually forms cavities. CM is a condition characterized by the mismatch of size between the brain and the skull. The skull is too small causing part of the brain to descend out of the skull through the opening at its base, crowding the spinal cord. The cause of CM is not yet fully understood. CM is rare in most breeds but reportedly has become very widespread in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and the Griffon Bruxellois (Brussels Griffon). Some researchers estimate that as many as 95% of CKCSs may have CM. It is worldwide in scope and not limited to any country, breeding line, or kennel, and experts report that it is believed to be inherited in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. CM is so widespread in the Cavalier that it may be an inherent part of the CKCS's breed standard. This disease not only affects thousands of dogs, but a similar condition affects over three hundred thousand children yearly. Therefore, canines are an appropriate model for the treatment of the human condition.

In his 1986 book \"Geopolitics\", Patrick O'Sullivan makes a geographically-based case against the proliferation of nuclear weapons during the Cold War, arguing that nuclear weapons pose a threat largely because they reduce the significance of both physical distance and national borders, which would otherwise function as a deterrent to the likelihood of direct military engagement.

The under-occupancy penalty has been widely branded the Bedroom Tax, especially by critics of the changes who argue that they amount to a tax because of the lack of social housing (or in some areas, any rented accommodation) for affected tenants to downsize to (and the refusal to accept the risk of taking lodgers in). The penalties are also criticised as having a disproportionate impact on disabled people. Context_2 : Monotenure is a planning term relating to the land tenure of a development or neighbourhood. There are generally three types of residential land tenure within the built environment: private sector housing (also known as market housing), social housing, and intermediate (or shared ownership) housing.

Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, the area of Balby stretches south of the town centre from the Balby Bridge area to Loversall, a small village bordering the new Woodfield Plantation residential development which is still expanding eastwards towards the Lakeside Village retail park. The area has a mixture of housing that has developed in accordance with growth patterns of other similar sized towns, with Victorian terraced housing nearer to the town centre and post-war built suburbs. The range of housing stock available means that there is a wide disparity in the socio-economic profile of the area with pockets of relative affluence of the newer suburbs seemingly juxtaposed with poorer areas, often social housing. Much of this social housing consisted of council houses, some of which has been subsequently sold off to become owner occupied under the Conservative Government's \"Right to Buy\" policy of the 1980s. Context_5 : The Gorbals is an area in the city of Glasgow, Scotland, on the south bank of the River Clyde.

As industrial jobs declined during restructuring, this area became widely known as a dangerous slum associated with drunkenness and crime. In the late twentieth century, it was subject to efforts at redevelopment, but poorly designed and constructed tower blocks of social housing contributed to further problems. Since the late twentieth century, much of the area has been demolished and redeveloped with a mixture of market and social housing. Some buildings are being refurbished and restored to a higher standard.

Located in the northwestern region of the U.S. state of Wyoming, Grand Teton National Park is 10 mi south of Yellowstone National Park which was established in 1872, when Wyoming, Idaho and Montana were still territories and the region was very sparsely settled. By the late 19th century, conservationists were working to provide further protection to surrounding regions, leading President Grover Cleveland to create the Teton Forest Reserve, which included a portion of northern Jackson Hole. By 1902, the reserve had been combined into the Yellowstone Forest Reserve, then was divided again in 1908 by President Theodore Roosevelt, establishing the Teton National Forest, which protected most of the Teton Range. By 1907, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation had constructed a temporary dam at the Snake River outlet of Jackson Lake. This dam failed in 1910 and a new concrete Jackson Lake Dam replaced it by 1911. The dam was further enlarged in 1916, raising lake waters 39 ft as part of the Minidoka Project, designed to provide irrigation for agriculture in the state of Idaho. Though efforts to protect the Teton Range and Jackson Hole as part of an expanded Yellowstone National Park dated back to the late 19th century, proposals to construct more dams on some of the other lakes in Jackson Hole led Yellowstone National Park superintendent Horace Albright to block such efforts. Albright was originally an advocate of the expanded Yellowstone plan which was very unpopular with local residents. By the mid-1920s local sentiment had changed as a result of proposals for a new national park including only the Teton Range and six lakes at the base of the range. With the general agreement of prominent Jackson Hole residents to this plan, President Calvin Coolidge signed the executive order establishing the 96000 acre Grand Teton National Park on February 26, 1929. fact_1 : Live Through This is the second studio album by American alternative rock band Hole. fact_2 :  The album's title is derived from a quote in \"Gone with the Wind\". fact_3 :  Set in the American South against the backdrop of the American Civil War and Reconstruction era, the film tells the story of Scarlett O'Hara, the strong-willed daughter of a Georgia plantation owner, from her romantic pursuit of Ashley Wilkes, who is married to his cousin, Melanie Hamilton, to her marriage to Rhett Butler.

Context_10 : Science and technology have a long history in Mexico. Ancient Mexican civilizations developed mathematics, astronomy, and calendrics, and solved technological problems of water management for agriculture and flood control in Central Mexico. Following the Spanish conquest in 1521, New Spain (colonial Mexico) was brought into the European sphere of science and technology. The Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico, established in 1551, was a hub of intellectual and religious development in colonial Mexico for over a century. During the Spanish American Enlightenment in Mexico, the colony made considerable progress in science, but following the war of independence and political instability in the early nineteenth century, progress stalled. During late 19th century under the regime of Porfirio D\u00edaz, the process of industrialization began in Mexico. Following the Mexican Revolution, a ten-year civil war, Mexico made significant progress in science and technology. During the 20th century, new universities, such as the National Polytecnical Institute, Monterrey Institute of Technology and research institutes, such as those at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, were established in Mexico. fact_1 : Ashesi University is a private, non-profit liberal arts college located in Ghana, West Africa. fact_2 : The National Autonomous University of Mexico (Spanish: \"Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico, - literal translation: Autonomous National University of Mexico\", UNAM) is a public research university in Mexico, one of the top universities in the world, and its campus is a UNESCO World Heritage site that was designed by some of Mexico's best-known architects of the 20th century.

Latin American countries are multi-ethnic, home to people of different ethnic and national backgrounds. As a result, some Latin Americans don't take their nationality as an ethnicity, but identify themselves with both their nationality and their ancestral origins. Aside from the indigenous Amerindian (aka Native American) population, all Latin Americans or their ancestors immigrated within the past five centuries. Latin America has the largest diasporas of Spaniards, Portuguese, Black Africans, Italians, Lebanese and Japanese in the world. The region also has large German (second largest after the United States), French, Chinese and Jewish diasporas. Context_2 : Asian Latin Americans are Latin Americans of East Asian, Western Asian, Southeast Asian or South Asian descent. Asian Latin Americans have a centuries-long history in the region, starting with Filipinos in the 16th century. The peak of Asian immigration occurred in the 19th and 20th centuries, however. There are currently more than four million Asian Latin Americans, nearly 1% of Latin America's population. Chinese and Japanese are the group's largest ancestries; other major ones include Arabs, Filipinos, Koreans, and Indians. Brazil is home to the largest population of Asian Latin Americans, at some 2.2 million. The highest ratio of any country in the region is 5%, in Peru. There has been notable emigration from these communities in recent decades, so that there are now hundreds of thousands of people of Asian Latin American origin in both Japan and the United States. Context_3 : Latin American migration to the United Kingdom dates back to the early 19th century. However, up until the 1970s, when political and civil unrest became rife in many Latin American countries, the United Kingdom's Latin American community was not particularly large. Latin Americans in the UK are now a rapidly growing group consisting of immigrants from Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico, Uruguay and Venezuela. Large numbers of refugees and asylum seekers moved to the UK during the late 20th century, however, since the turn of the millennium, Latin Americans have been migrating to the UK for a wide range of reasons and at present the community consists of people from all walks of life. The UK is also home to British-born people of Latin American ancestry, as well as some Hispanic and Latino Americans. In recent years, Britain has also become one of the favorite European destinations for some of Spain's hundreds of thousands of Latin Americans who have acquired Spanish citizenship, seeking to escape their adopted country's prolonged economic crisis. Context_4 : The Criollo (] ) is a term which, in modern times, has diverse meanings, but is most commonly associated with Latin Americans who are of full or near full pre-colonial Spanish descent, distinguishing them from both multi-racial Latin Americans and Latin Americans of post-colonial (and not necessarily Spanish) European immigrant origin. Historically, they were a social class in the hierarchy of the overseas colonies established by Spain beginning in the 16th century, especially in Hispanic America, comprising the locally born people of Spanish ancestry. Although \"Criollos\" were legally Spaniards, in practice, they ranked below the Iberian-born \"Peninsulares\". Nevertheless, they had preeminence over all the other populations: Amerindians, enslaved Africans and peoples of mixed descent. Context_5 : White Latin Americans or European Latin Americans are Latin Americans who are considered white, typically due to European, or in some cases Levantine, descent. Latin American countries have often encouraged miscegenation, and even a small amount of European ancestry could entail significant upwards social mobility. Context_6 : Sephardic Bnei Anusim (Hebrew: \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d0\u05e0\u05d5\u05e1\u05d9\u05dd \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd\u200e , ] , lit. \"Children [of the] coerced [converted] Spanish [Jews]) is a modern term used to define the contemporary Christian descendants of estimated quarter of a million 15th-century Sephardic Jewish which were coerced or forced to convert to Catholicism during the 14th and 15th century in Spain. The vast majority of Conversos remained in Spain and Portugal, their descendants in both these countries numbering in the millions. The small minority of Conversos who did emigrate normally chose destinations where Sephardic communities already existed, particularly in the Ottoman Empire and North Africa, but also more tolerant cities in Europe, immediately reverting to Judaism. Although a few did their travel to Spanish America, doing so was particularly difficult since only those Spaniards who could certify no recent Muslim or Jewish ancestry were allowed to travel to the New World. Nevertheless, the constant flow of Spanish emigration to Latin America up until well into the 20th century has resulted to many Latin Americans having Converso ancestry, in the same way as modern Spaniards do. Context_7 : The Atlantic slave trade or transatlantic slave trade involved the transportation by slave traders of enslaved African people, mainly from Africa to the Americas, and then their sale there. The slave trade used mainly the triangular trade route and its Middle Passage, and existed from the 16th to the 19th centuries. The vast majority of those who were enslaved and transported in the transatlantic slave trade were Africans from central and western Africa, who had been sold by other West Africans to Western European slave traders (with a small number being captured directly by the slave traders in coastal raids), who brought them to the Americas. The South Atlantic and Caribbean economies especially were dependent on the supply of secure labour for the production of commodity crops, making goods and clothing to sell in Europe. This was crucial to those western European countries which, in the late 17th and 18th centuries, were vying with each other to create overseas empires. Context_8 : Afro-Latin Americans or Black Latin Americans refers to Latin American people of significant African ancestry. The term may also refer to historical or cultural elements in Latin America thought to have emanated from this community. Context_9 : Afro-Chileans are citizens of Chile, descended from Africans who were brought to the New World with the arrival of the Spaniards toward the end of the slave trade. Context_10 : Mestizo ( ; Peninsular Spanish: ] , Latin American Spanish , Philippine Spanish: ] ) is a term traditionally used in Spain, the Philippines, parts of Central America, especially in Belize and Latin America which originally meant a person of combined European and Amerindian or Pacific Islander descent, regardless of where the person was born. The term was used as an ethnic/racial category in the casta system that was in use during the Spanish Empire's control of their New World colonies. Nowadays though, particularly in Latin America, Mestizo has become more of a cultural term, with culturally mainstream Latin Americans regarded or termed as Mestizos regardless of their actual ancestry, and with the term \"Indian\" being reserved exclusively for people who have maintained a separate ethnic identity, language, tribal affiliation, etc. Consequently, today, the vast majority of Spanish speaking Latin Americans are regarded as Mestizos, although because of this newer, culturally based definition, this term cannot be taken as indicative of actual ancestry. fact_1 : Afro-Chileans are citizens of Chile, descended from Africans who were brought to the New World with the arrival of the Spaniards toward the end of the slave trade. fact_2 : Afro-Latin Americans or Black Latin Americans refers to Latin American people of significant African ancestry.

It is often used as a hiking, hunting, and off-roading area for dirt bikers, quadders, paintballers, and four-wheelers that includes miles of trails with near beach sand consistency. Spinney hills gets its name because of Spinney Road, which used to connect the East Quogue side of the hills to Sears Bellows County Park and Flanders (home of the Big Duck) to the north prior to the construction of the Sunrise Highway New York State Route 27. This region was created by glacial deposits of rock and sand during the last ice age. The sandy soil also absorbs most rainfall so there are few ponds or rivers in the area. There is a shallow glacial well in Spinney Hills known as an aquifer, which is where most of the rainfall in the region is stored. These hills are the continuation of a long east west ridge of hills known as the Ronkonkoma Moraine, which form the 'backbone' of Long Island. Much of this region is undeveloped other than a sand mine to the west and Southampton Pines to the east. There have been large scale legal battles between private real estate companies and the Town of Southampton over the future of the area, being it is one of the last expanses of wilderness left on Long Island. There is a very large native population of white-tailed deer in the region due to lack of natural predators. In the higher elevations small sections of the hills have an almost alpine-desert look, with sandy open plateaus and extremely dwarfed vegetation . The Dwarf Pitch Pine which dominate the region grow not much taller than twenty feet in height due to dry, nutrient-poor soil. There is a desert effect in the Pine Barrens, with relatively higher daytime temperatures and cooler nighttime temperatures than the coast, only a few miles away. There are spectacular views of the Atlantic Ocean and Peconic Bay from certain peaks in this region if one knows where to hike. The consistent ocean breeze at the higher elevations passing through the long brushy needles of the Dwarf Pitch Pines creates a gentle whisping sound, or white noise, adding a peaceful ambience to the big skies and expansiveness one feels in this region. Context_2 : Cucurbita digitata is a species of flowering plant in the squash family known by the common names fingerleaf gourd and bitter squash. It is similar to \"Cucurbita californica\", \"Cucurbita cordata\", \"Cucurbita cylindrata\", and \"Cucurbita palmata\" and all these species hybridize readily. These species form the only restricted xerophyte species group in the genus \"Cucurbita\". Each member of this species group is native to the Southwestern United States and Northwestern Mexico where they are relatively uncommon. Each group member is found in hot, arid regions with low rainfall. They prefer soil that is loose, gravelly, and well-drained. \"C. digitata\" is native to northern Baja California at higher elevations, northern Sonora, Mexico, southern Arizona, and southwestern New Mexico. The juvenile leaves of \"C. cylindrata\", \"C. cordata\", \"C. digitata\", and \"C. palmata\" show a high degree of similarity, but their mature leaves are visibly different, as are their root structures. \"C. palmata\" and \"C. digitata\" are sympatric, with \"C. palmata\" separating the ranges of \"C. digitata\" at the juncture of Baja California, California, and Arizona. \"C. digitata\" fruits are clear green mottle that turns yellow at maturity, striped, and round.

It was first identified by Sereno Watson in 1876. These species form the only restricted xerophyte species group in the genus \"Cucurbita\". Each member of this species group is native to the Southwestern United States and Northwestern Mexico where they are relatively uncommon. Each group member is found in hot, arid regions with low rainfall. They prefer soil that is loose, gravelly, and well-drained. \"C. palmata\" is native to northeastern Baja California, southeastern California, and southwestern Arizona to a point near the Colorado River.

Each member of this species group is native to the Southwestern United States and Northwestern Mexico where they are relatively uncommon. Each group member is found in hot, arid regions with low rainfall. They prefer soil that is loose, gravelly, and well-drained. \"C. cylindrata\" is found only in the middle portion of Baja California, mostly in Baja California Sur. Botanists Bemis and Whitaker suggest that \"C. cordata\" and \"C. cylindrata\" may be a case of sympatric speciation. The juvenile leaves of \"C. cylindrata\", \"C. cordata\", \"C. digitata\", and \"C. palmata\" show a high degree of similarity, but their mature leaves are visibly different, as are their root structures. \"C. cylindrata\" fruits are dark green, striped, and round. Context_5 : The cowpea, \"Vigna unguiculata\", is an annual herbaceous legume from the genus \"Vigna\". Due to its tolerance for sandy soil and low rainfall it is an important crop in the semi-arid regions across Africa and other countries. It requires very few inputs, as the plants root nodules are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it a valuable crop for resource poor farmers and well-suited to intercropping with other crops. The whole plant is used as forage for animals, with its use as cattle feed likely responsible for its name. Context_6 : Cucurbita cordata is a species of flowering plant in the squash family.

Each group member is found in hot, arid regions with low rainfall. They prefer soil that is loose, gravelly, and well-drained. \"C. cordata\" is found only in the vicinity of Bah\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles, Baja California. Botanists Bemis and Whitaker suggest that \"C. cordata\" and \"C. cylindrata\" may be a case of sympatric speciation. The juvenile leaves of \"C. cylindrata\", \"C. cordata\", \"C. digitata\", and \"C. palmata\" show a high degree of similarity, but their mature leaves are visibly different, as are their root structures. \"C. cordata\" fruits are gray green, striped, and round. Context_7 : Limnophila aromatica (synonym: Limnophila chinensis var. aromatica; also called rice paddy herb) is a tropical flowering plant in the plantain family, Plantaginaceae.

It is called \"Ng\u00f2 \u00f4m\" or \"ng\u00f2 om\" or \"ng\u1ed5\" in Vietnam and used as an herb and also cultivated for use as an aquarium plant. The plant was introduced to North America in the 1970s due to Vietnamese immigration following the Vietnam War. It is called \"ma om\" (\u1798\u17d2\u17a2\u1798) in Khmer. It is used in traditional Cambodian soup dishes and Southern Vietnamese cuisine. It can grow in flooded rice paddies during wet season but it grows best on drained but still wet sandy soil of harvested rice paddies for a few months after the rainy season ended. It dies out soon after it flowers. Rural Cambodians often harvest them and put them on the roof of their houses to dry for later use.

Context_10 : High marsh is a tidal marsh zone located above the Mean Highwater Mark (MHW) which, in contrast to the low marsh zone, is inundated infrequently during periods of extreme high tide and storm surge associated with coastal storms. The high marsh is the intermittent zone between the low marsh and the uplands, an entirely terrestrial area rarely flooded during events of extreme tidal action caused by severe coastal storms. The high marsh is distinguished from the low marsh by its sandy soil and higher elevation. The elevation of the high marsh allows this zone to be covered by the high tide for no more than an hour a day. With the soil exposed to air for long periods of time, evaporation occurs, leading to high salinity levels, up to four times that of sea water. Areas of extremely high salinity prohibit plant growth altogether. These barren sandy areas are known as \"salt pans\". Some cordgrass plants do survive here, but are stunted and do not reach their full size. fact_1 : Luma is a genus of flowering plants in the myrtle family Myrtaceae, described as a genus in 1853. fact_2 : The cowpea, \"Vigna unguiculata\", is an annual herbaceous legume from the genus \"Vigna\". fact_3 :  Due to its tolerance for sandy soil and low rainfall it is an important crop in the semi-arid regions across Africa and other countries.

The population suffering from the disease in Israel at the time was composed primarily of newly arrived immigrants and populations who were expected to emigrate, mostly from North Africa, as well as some from Middle East and elsewhere, but many Jewish children were irradiated in their home countries regardless of their intent to emigrate.

Context_5 : Targeted threats are a class of malware destined for one specific organization or industry. A type of crimeware, these threats are of particular concern because they are designed to capture sensitive information. Targeted attacks may include threats delivered via SMTP e-mail, port attacks, zero day attack vulnerability exploits or phishing messages. Government organisations are the most targeted sector. Financial industries are the second most targeted sector, most likely because cybercriminals desire to profit from the confidential, sensitive information the financial industry IT infrastructure houses. Similarly, online brokerage accounts have also been targeted by such attacks. Context_6 : Information security awareness is an evolving part of information security that focuses on raising consciousness regarding potential risks of the rapidly evolving forms of information and the rapidly evolving threats to that information which target human behavior. As threats have matured and information has increased in value, attackers have increased their capabilities and expanded to broader intentions, developed more attack methods and methodologies and are acting on more diverse motives. As information security controls and processes have matured, attacks have matured to circumvent controls and processes. Attackers have targeted and successfully exploited individuals human behavior to breach corporate networks and critical infrastructure systems. Targeted individuals who are unaware of information and threats may unknowingly circumvent traditional security controls and processes and enable a breach of the organization. In response, information security awareness is maturing. Cybersecurity as a business problem has dominated the agenda of most chief information officers (CIO)s, exposing a need for countermeasures to today's cyber threat landscape. The goal of Information security awareness is to make everyone aware that they are susceptible to the opportunities and challenges in today\u2019s threat landscape, change human risk behaviors and create or enhance a secure organizational culture.

Context_3 : The conflict between the dynasties of the Capetians and Plantagenets covers a period of 100 years (1159-1259), during which the Kingdom of France fought against the Angevin Empire. This conflict is also called by some historians, the \"First Hundred Years War.\" The conflict is primarily French, since both dynasties were French, the nobles that made up the English army were essentially of French origin, and the foot soldiers of the English king were local recruits in France (Anjou, Guyenne, Normandy, Brittany etc.). At this period, the English king's continental possessions were considered more important than his island possessions, and significantly greater than even those of the French sovereign, even if the latter was the overlord of the former for most of the possessions he held on the continent. And the official language of the two belligerents is the French of that time. French also remained the official language of England until 1361. Such is the origin of the expressions that can still be found today on the shields and coat of arms of the English monarchy \"Honi soit qui mal y pense\" and \"Dieu et mon droit\". The English kings, who were of French origin, took wives from France from the 11th to the 15th century. Very rare are those who married a woman of another country, including the cadet branches. Hence the Plantagenet monarchs were ethnically French.

Whisenant was quoted as saying \"Only if the Bible is in error am I wrong; and I say that to every preacher in town\" and \"[I]f there were a king in this country and I could gamble with my life, I would stake my life on Rosh Hashana 88.\" Context_9 : 9-man (also nine-man, nineman, 9man) is a team sport with some characteristics of volleyball utilizing nine players per side and a slightly larger court (10 by 20 meters). Historically, the sport was played by Chinese immigrants to the US, who predominantly hailed from Toisan (Taishan) city in Guangdong province of China. In the late 1930s the sport was used as a means to socially connect the laborers in Chinatowns across the United States. Teams from Boston and Providence, RI held the first organized nine-man tournament in 1938 which later spread to Chinatowns in other large US and Canadian cities. The North American version of 9-Man continues to grow today with a popular rotating tournament called the NACIVT uniting thousands of players and spectators each September over Labor Day weekend. It is unclear whether the sport was also played in the Asian Games in 1958 and in 1962 held in Tokyo and Jakarta, respectively, or if they were simply playing volleyball with nine players. The sport has not made a reappearance in the Asian Games since, and many believe that the rules of nine-man are exclusive to the community that plays in North America. The sport is the subject of an award-winning documentary called 9-Man that was completed in 2014 and had its world premiere at IFFBoston on April 27, 2014 at 1pm. The film was broadcast on the PBS World Channel series America ReFramed on May 5, 2015.

(\"Hypo\"- refers to \"less\", and \"chromic\" means \"color\".) A normal red blood cell will have an area of pallor in the center of it; it is biconcave disk shaped. In hypochromic cells, this area of central pallor is increased. This decrease in redness is due to a disproportionate reduction of red cell hemoglobin (the pigment that imparts the red color) in proportion to the volume of the cell. Clinically the color can be evaluated by the Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH) or Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC). The MCHC is considered the better parameter of the two as it adjusts for effect the size of the cell has on its color. Hypochromia is clinically defined as below the normal MHC reference range of 27-33 picograms/cell in adults or below the normal MCHC reference range of 33-36 g/dL in adults. Context_2 : The Nazi Lowriders (or NLR, or The Ride) are an organized crime syndicate, and peckerwood prison and street gang based primarily in Southern California and Texas. They also have small factions in rural and suburban Chicago, and are believed to have spread to many other states. They are allies of the larger and more notorious gangs, the Aryan Brotherhood and the Mexican Mafia and fellow peckerwood gang Public Enemy No. 1. Their main rivals are the Bloods, the Crips, the Black Guerrilla Family, MS-13, Nortenos, and Nuestra Familia. The Nazi Low Riders operate in and outside prison walls. They are often fueled by their drug of choice, methamphetamine. NLR violence has struck the general public, including police officers. Context_3 : The color blood red is a dark shade of the color red meant to resemble the color of human blood (which is composed of oxygenated red erythrocytes, white leukocytes, and yellow blood plasma). It is the iron in hemoglobin specifically that gives blood its red color. The actual color ranges from crimson to a dark brown-red depending on how oxygenated the blood is, and may have a slightly orange hue. Deoxygenated blood, which circulates closer to the body's surface and which is therefore generally more likely to be seen than oxygenated blood, issues from bodily veins in a dark red state, but quickly oxygenates upon exposure to air, turning a brighter shade of red. This happens more quickly with smaller volumes of blood such as a pinprick and less quickly from cuts or punctures that cause greater blood flows such as a puncture in the basilic vein: all blood collected during a phlebotomy procedure is deoxygenated blood, and it does not usually have a chance to become oxygenated upon leaving the body. Arterial blood, which is already oxygenated, is also already a brighter shade of red\u2014 this is the blood see from a pulsating neck, arm, or leg wound, and it does not change color upon exposure to air. The color \"blood red\", therefore, covers both these states: the darker deoxygenated color and the brighter oxygenated one. Also, dried blood often has a darker, rust-colored quality: all dried blood has been oxygenated and then desiccated, causing the cells within it to die. This blood is often darker than either shade of red that can be seen in fresh blood. Context_4 : Dermatophyte test medium (DTM) is a specialized agar used in medical mycology. It is based on Sabouraud's dextrose agar with added cycloheximide to inhibit saprotrophic growth, antibiotic to inhibit bacterial growth, and phenol red a pH indicator. The pH indicator is useful in distinguishing a dermatophyte fungus, which utilizes nitrogenous material for preferred metabolism, producing alkaline by-products, imparting a red color change to the medium. Typical saprotrophic fungi utilize carbohydrates in the medium producing acidic by-products and no red color change. Context_5 : Amaranth, FD&C Red No. 2, E123, C.I. Food Red 9, Acid Red 27, Azorubin S, or C.I. 16185 is a dark red to purple azo dye used as a food dye and to color cosmetics. The name was taken from amaranth grain, a plant distinguished by its red color and edible protein-rich seeds. Context_6 : Red beds (or redbeds) are sedimentary rocks, which typically consist of sandstone, siltstone, and shale that are predominantly red in color due to the presence of ferric oxides. Frequently, these red-colored sedimentary strata locally contain thin beds of conglomerate, marl, limestone, or some combination of these sedimentary rocks. The ferric oxides, which are responsible for the red color of red beds, typically occur as a coating on the grains of sediments comprising red beds. Classic examples of red beds are the Permian and Triassic strata of the western United States and the Devonian Old Red Sandstone facies of Europe. Context_7 : Red diamond is a diamond which displays red color throughout its prism, and exhibits all the same mineral properties as colorless diamonds. Red diamonds are commonly known as the most expensive and the rarest diamond color in the world, even more so than pink diamonds or blue diamonds. Red diamonds, just like pink diamonds are greatly debated as to the source of their color, but the gemological community most commonly attributes both colors to gliding atoms in the diamond\u2019s structure as it undergoes enormous pressure during its formation. Context_8 : Red wine is a type of wine made from dark-colored (black) grape varieties. The actual color of the wine can range from intense violet, typical of young wines, through to brick red for mature wines and brown for older red wines. The juice from most purple grapes is greenish-white; the red color comes from anthocyan pigments (also called anthocyanins) present in the skin of the grape; exceptions are the relatively uncommon teinturier varieties, which produce a red colored. Much of the red-wine production process therefore involves extraction of color and flavor components from the grape skin. Context_9 : The Union Philosophical Society or UPS is the seventh-oldest collegiate organization in the United States, and one of the three oldest literary societies. Founded at Dickinson College in 1789, it took the white rose and the Roman goddess Minerva as its primary symbols. The Union Philosophical Society adopted a badge in 1791, designed as a Maltese Cross with a wreath of white roses about the letters 'U.P.S.'. The white rose of this society is responsible for the white color adopted as one of the honorary colors of Dickinson College (the red rose of the Belles Lettres Society is responsible for the red color adopted as the other honorary color of Dickinson College). This was in opposition to Belles Lettres, the sixth oldest collegiate organization in the US, and founded three years before UPS. Throughout the college's history and only discontinued in the mid-20th century, Dickinson students had to join either Belles Lettres or Union Philosophical Society to participate in other extracurricular collegiate activities. Belles Lettres and UPS developed a rivalry that continues to this day.

Stevenson's character begins telling doctor after doctor that her son seemed to develop autism soon after he received the MMR vaccine, but she does not receive any sympathy from them, nor does she receive any from her boss, or even her husband. However, this all changes when she meets Dr. Wakefield, who believes her statements about the MMR vaccine causing her son's autism.

Context_6 : Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor is a 2003 American television film directed by Mikael Salomon and starring Aidan Quinn, Kelsey Grammer, Flora Montgomery and John Light. It portrays the career of Benedict Arnold in the American Revolutionary War and his dramatic switch in 1780 from fighting for American Independence to being a Loyalist trying to preserve British rule in America. Arnold's relationships with his wife Peggy Shippen and the British officer John Andre are focused on. The friction between Arnold and General Horatio Gates, portrayed near the beginning of the film (for example, in one scene when Arnold derisively refers to him as \"Granny Gates\"), was historically accurate. The movie points out that, before his treason, Arnold was considered a patriot and a hero.

It refers to the relationship between worship and belief, and is an ancient Christian principle which provided a measure for developing the ancient Christian creeds, the canon of scripture and other doctrinal matters based on the prayer texts of the Church, that is, the Church's liturgy. In the Early Church, there was liturgical tradition before there was a common creed and before there was an officially sanctioned biblical canon. These liturgical traditions provided the theological framework for establishing the creeds and canon.

This flour like substance was then leached several times with water until the acorn mush was no longer bitter (this also indicated that the mush was safe for consumption). This mush was then cooked in a waterproof basket with hot rocks and then served. California Indians continue to eat wiiwish both the traditional way and with alterations. These alterations include using other tools to grind down the acorns such as a coffee grinder or/and adding sugar or other seasonings to the finished wiiwish.
