An element is at the intersection of two given sets, A and B, if common to both A and B. Classify your answers into 'Yes' or 'No'.", "input": "Set1: '{3}', Set2: '{1, 11, 4}'. Is the element '11' in the intersection of Set1 and Set2 ?", "output": "No", "category": "Program Execution 873.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given two sets, and a question.
