Trump took to Twitter on Tuesday to claim that Tennessee Republican helped \"give us\" the nuclear deal with Iran negotiated by President Barack Obama's administration. Earlier this month  he claimed that  Corker  is \"largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal!\"\n Corker  the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee   was in fact a vehement critic of the deal that emerged from international negotiations in the summer of 2015. After the deal was unveiled   he  wrote in an op-ed for The Washington Post that \"Congress should reject this deal and send it back to the President.\"\n Corker  plotted efforts to block the deal  banding with Republicans -- and even some Democrats -- in an attempt to block the deal.\nThe following month   Corker  did just that  joining with the bipartisan group to vote against the deal. A procedural vote to move forward a resolution to reject the nuclear deal fell shy of the required 60-vote threshold.\nEven before that vote   Corker  helped push through the legislation that would ultimately grant Congress powers to review the deal  which the Obama administration contemplated approving without congressional oversight.\n Corker  said such an attempt would be \"a direct affront to the American people and seeks to undermine Congress' appropriate role\" in a March 2015 letter to Obama.\n Corker 's calls for congressional review of the nuclear deal that was still being negotiated in the spring of 2015 ultimately led to the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act  which Obama ultimately signed despite initially opposing the measure.\nThat could be what White House press secretary Sarah Sanders was referring to on October 10 when she claimed: \" Sen. Corker  worked with Nancy Pelosi and the Obama administration to pave the way for that legislation and basically rolled out the red carpet for the Iran deal  and those are pretty factual.\"\n Corker  defended the bill against that criticism in September 2015  noting that the legislation \"actually took power back from the president.\"\n\"Without it  he could have unilaterally implemented the deal immediately. The President never would have been forced to submit the agreement to Congress and there would have been no review and no debate on this critical national security issue \"  Corker  said then.\nTrump's criticism of  Corker  on the Iran deal is also curious given that Trump initially considered  Corker  as a candidate for vice president and later secretary of state  in large part due to his foreign policy chops.", "output": "Positive", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

We know President Donald Trump during the campaign publicly encouraged the Russians to hack and release Hillary Clinton's emails.

We also know that Donald Trump Jr.  Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort met with Russians in June 2016 with the promise of \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton  and we have learned that campaign adviser George Papadopoulos had extensive contacts with Russian officials that included discussion of \"dirt\" on Clinton.

FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe  a target of frequent and aggressive criticism by President Donald Trump  abruptly stepped down from his position Monday ahead of his planned retirement this spring.\n McCabe   who has held a number of FBI leadership roles and been heavily involved in investigations into major crimes including the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing  becomes eligible for retirement in a matter of weeks. FBI staff learned Monday that  McCabe  was leaving the bureau's No. 2 post effective immediately  according to people who spoke only on condition of anonymity to discuss an internal personnel move. He is expected to retire with full pension benefits.\nIn a message Monday to FBI employees  Wray said  McCabe  would be retiring on March 18 and denied that the move stemmed from political pressure.\nThe exit comes amid multiple ongoing investigations  including a Justice Department watchdog probe into the actions of  McCabe  and other top FBI officials during the Clinton email probe. In addition  special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating whether the Trump campaign improperly coordinated with Russia during the 2016 presidential election and whether Trump sought to obstruct the inquiry by  among other actions  firing Comey.\n McCabe  has been repeatedly assailed by Trump since the fall of 2016  when it was revealed that  his  wife had accepted campaign contributions from the political action committee of then-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe  a Democrat and close Clinton ally  during a failed state Senate run. That episode is among the decisions under review by the Justice Department's inspector general  which is expected to complete its report soon.\nThe FBI has said  McCabe  received the necessary ethics approval  and that at the time of the contributions   he  was not in a supervisory role on the Clinton email investigation. But that has not stopped Trump and Republicans in Congress from repeatedly asserting that  McCabe   and other FBI officials  are partisan law enforcement officials harboring a bias against him.\nResponding to December news reports that  McCabe  would retire  the president wrote: \"How can  FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe  the man in charge  along with leakin'  James Comey  of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33 000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700 000 for wife's campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?\"\nAnother of the president's tweets from last year said: \"Why didn't A.G. Sessions replace Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe  a Comey friend who was in charge of Clinton investigation \" referring to Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\nThough  McCabe  has pushed back against White House narratives that Comey was not well-liked within the bureau  and that an ongoing FBI investigation into Trump campaign ties to Russia was not a significant matter for the FBI   he  has not publicly discussed in detail  his  interactions with Trump or shared any personal observations of the president.\nThat could change upon  his  departure from the FBI. Comey  for instance  after his firing authorized a close friend to share with reporters details of his own encounters with the president that he said troubled him. And former CIA Director John Brennan and James Clapper  the retired director of national intelligence  have been outspoken about their own views of Trump.\nHe took over as acting director following Trump's May 9 firing of Comey  and was among the officials interviewed for the position  which ultimately went to Wray  a former Justice Department official. The Washington Post reported last week that Trump asked  McCabe  whom he had voted for in the presidential election. Trump has said he does not recall asking that question.\n McCabe 's defenders call  him  a thoughtful  intelligent and committed career agent.\nComey tweeted that  McCabe  \"stood tall over the last 8 months  when small people were trying to tear down an institution we all depend on.\"\nFormer Attorney General Eric Holder tweeted: \" FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe  is  and has been  a dedicated public servant who has served this country well. Bogus attacks on the FBI and DOJ to distract attention from a legitimate criminal inquiry does long term  unnecessary damage to these foundations of our government.\"\nTwo days after Comey's firing   McCabe  appeared at a congressional hearing and contradicted a White House assertion that Comey had lost the support of FBI rank-and-file. He declared  \"I can tell you that the majority  the vast majority of FBI employees  enjoyed a deep and positive connection to Director Comey.\"", "output": "Positive", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

FRISCO  Texas (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094  Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones  says  his  objection to a contract extension for NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell is not because of star running back Ezekiel Elliott's six-game suspension over alleged domestic violence.\n Jones  said on  his  radio show Friday  he  wants all 32 owners to have a chance to approve the deal being negotiated between Goodell and the compensation committee that includes six owners.  Jones  is not on the committee.\nThe NFL has said owners already voted unanimously to extend Goodell's contract and authorize the committee to work out the deal.  Jones  said circumstances have changed since that May vote  including the escalation of the protests over social injustice that have involved the national anthem.\n Jones  also said \"behavioral policies\" have been an issue since May. Goodell suspended Elliott in August.\nHe suggested he was at odds with the compensation committee chairman  Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank.  Jones  said  he  disagrees with Blank's assertion that the compensation committee can complete the deal without another vote of all owners.\n Jones  spoke a day after a federal appeals court on Thursday denied bid by Elliott to keep his six-game ban on hold  making him ineligible to play against Atlanta on Sunday.\n\"I really fervently disagree that we shouldn't have him on the playing field \"  Jones  said. \"But a lot of people are trying to tie it in frankly with the issue regarding my stance as to the chairman and renewing the commissioner. That's really not right.\"\n The 75-year-old Jones  said the compensation committee could appease  him  by agreeing to let the remaining owners review and approve the final contract with Goodell.\n\"I think just since the period of time that we first addressed extending Roger  I think we've had several material adverse conditions happen  \" Jones  said. \"We should basically honor those conditions  such things as the anthem  such things as behavioral policies.\n Jones  said  his  relationship with Goodell  and issues related to  his  compensation  are deeper than  his  recent concern over the league's handling of Elliott's case.\n\"I've been dealing with this commissioner for almost 28 years  as an employee of the NFL  \" Jones  said. \"Zeke's been involved here a year  a year and a half. The policy that we have that has impacted Zeke is more of my issue with the commissioner  more so than Zeke's particular circumstance.\"\nThe anthem issue flared after President Donald Trump criticized kneeling players  and again when  Jones  declared  he  would bench any player  he  felt was disrespecting the flag. The NFL hasn't changed a guideline that encourages but does not require players to stand during the anthem.\n\"This is simply about making sure that all clubs have input into not only what the commissioner  his extension  but also in future years  his decisions  \" Jones  said. \"We've given him a lot of power. I think we need the checks and balances of ownership having to actually be in a position to not just suggest but approve of his decisions.\"", "output": "Positive", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

One of the emails quoted in the document  according to the Post  \u00e2\u0080\u009cappears to match one described to the Washington Post in August in which Papadopoulos identified the professor with whom he met as Joseph Mifsud  the director of the London Academy of Diplomacy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But the Post reported that in August Mifsud told the newspaper he had \u00e2\u0080\u009cabsolutely no contact with the Russian government \u00e2\u0080\u009d and he insisted his ties to Russia were purely academic.\nThe public record  though  contains information contradicting  Mifsud  and showing that  he  has had contacts with Russian government officials. According to photos on the website of Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s embassy in the United Kingdom   Mifsud  met with embassy representative Ernest Chernukhin in July of this year (weeks before  he  issued  his  denial to the Post). A biography from a 2013 business conference says  Mifsud  \u00e2\u0080\u009chas advised Governments on international education issues in many countries including Morocco  Syria  Russia  Tunisia  and Italy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Mifsud  also met with Russian Ambassador to the UK Alexander Yakovenko in May of 2014  according to a 2014 Russian embassy press release.\nAdditionally  in early 2017   Mifsud  invited Alexey Klishin  a department head and professor in the international law division of the Moscow State Institute of International Relations  a school run by Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Foreign Ministry  to the London Academy of Diplomacy to present a lecture. Klishin was a former member of the upper house of the Russian parliament. According to a January 2017 press release from the Institution of the Russian Academy of Sciences  \u00e2\u0080\u009cKlishin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presentation was devoted to international law and national legal systems [and] to their coexistence in the era of Brexit and the new presidency in the United States.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The release noted that Klishin had \u00e2\u0080\u009cvisited the London Academy of Diplomacy at the University of Stirling\u00e2\u0080\u00a6at the invitation of  the Director Joseph Mifsud .\u00e2\u0080\u009d Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a photo with  Mifsud  (second from the right) and Klishin (center) standing next to each other:\n Mifsud  did not respond to a request for comment from Mother Jones.\nOne obvious question for the professor is why he told the Post he had \u00e2\u0080\u009cabsolutely\u00e2\u0080\u009d no contacts with Russian officials when on-line material suggests he has. There are no indication in the Mueller statement whether his team has questioned  Mifsud  about the Clinton \u00e2\u0080\u009cdirt\u00e2\u0080\u009d or Papadopoulos\u00e2\u0080\u0099s initiative to create a back-channel bond between the Trump campaign and Vladimir Putin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office.\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another reason why  Mifsud  could be of interest to Mueller and his investigators. In the past year  the New York Times has reported that US intelligence agencies collected information in the summer of 2016 indicating that top Russian intelligence and political officials were looking to gain influence over Trump through his advisers and that US spy agencies had intercepted calls showing that Trump campaign aides and other Trump associates had repeated interactions with senior Russian intelligence officials  perhaps unwittingly. (In June  former FBI chief James Comey  in congressional testimony  disputed the Times story disclosing contacts between the Trump aides and Russian intelligence  but he did not specify what was wrong with the article.) So Mueller is no doubt looking for possible instances of when Russian intelligence infiltrated\u00e2\u0080\u0094or tried to infiltrate\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Trump campaign  either directly or through witting or unwitting cut-outs. And the Papadopoulos episode could be a case not only of a Trump aide trying to establish a campaign connection with the Kremlin but of Russian intelligence attempting to score a contact within the Trump campaign.", "output": "Positive", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

David Dobbs' new feature in our October 2017 issue  \"The Touch of Madness \" tells a story that is both heartbreaking and uplifting  and all too familiar: A young woman with a bright future temporarily loses herself in mental illness  and finds the fraying of her social bonds to be more durably worse  in some respects  than the underlying condition itself. That young woman  Nev Jones  manages to pull herself out of the bottom of the well  finishing graduate school and going on to become a key advocate and scholar among reform-minded thinkers in the world of mental-health treatment and policy. But it wasn't easy\u00e2\u0080\u0094and wouldn't have been possible without the ideas and support of the practitioners and scholars she found shortly after her mental illness derailed her graduate studies.\nYour story describes how  the mental-health researcher and activist Nev Jones (and a growing number of others)  are pushing for the medical establishment to think about schizophrenia\u00e2\u0080\u0094or related diagnoses of \"madness \" as  they  are known colloquially\u00e2\u0080\u0094in a radically new way. What is new about it  and what makes it so radical?\n Nev Jones  and other scholars and advocates like  her  want us to see what  they  call madness  meaning schizophrenia  bipolar  and other serious mental ailments  less as biological phenomena  and more as cultural phenomena.  They 're asking us to see these phenomena not only as a breakdown of brain connection  as  they 're typically cast in the West  but as breakdowns in social connection.  They  want us to see how culture shapes madness: People with schizophrenia simply do worse in societies that define schizophrenia as primarily biological and that isolate people who are mad.\nWho is  Nev Jones   how did you find  her   and how did  she  come to these ideas?\nA few years ago in 2012  after the mass shooting in a movie theater in Aurora  Colorado  I wrote a blog post for Wired about how it's not coincidental that some of the sickest and most paranoid and angry people who go mad in the U.S. resort to violence\u00e2\u0080\u0094with guns in particular. It's an expression of madness that does not happen in places that are less gun-oriented and less violent overall. The idea was that culture shapes the expression of madness in that way. It got a lot of pushback  so I did another iteration of the blog post  and in doing that I looked around the Internet to find people who articulated the same idea better than I did  and one of those people was  Nev Jones .  She  had related some episodes from  her  own descent into madness that were helpful in illustrating what I was trying to say.\nAt the time  she  was a graduate student and still in the middle of  her  recovery from a psychotic episode that  she  had in grad school  after the school bungled a few things in response to  her  psychosis and proved far from helpful. The societal response in  her  case seemed to aggravate  her  deep psychotic state that lasted for some time.  She  was able to climb out of that by connecting to other people and by studying and absorbing  herself  in the literature on how culture shapes madness.  She  connected with other people who studied it and wanted to get the word out.  She  proved effective at this  finishing  her  studies in community psychology at DePaul University  and then becoming more well known in what some people call the madness community. These are people who study it and advocate for those who have had it  whom they call people with lived experience.\n She  ended up getting an invitation to go to Stanford University's anthropology department. What  she  was doing was tapping into a couple of decades of increasingly busy and deep work in academia  looking at how culture\u00e2\u0080\u0094broadly defined\u00e2\u0080\u0094affects our view of madness  in particular how it affects the experience of people who have schizophrenia. In Nev Jones  I found someone who was by all accounts one of the most dynamic and exciting experts in the field  and  she  was also someone who lived through this and had deep insight both from  her  scholarship and from  her  experience of becoming very sick for a couple of years  and used  her  insights on how cultures shapes madness to climb back out of  her  illness to a state of high-function and happiness.\n Nev  and  her  peers are not making the case that physical characteristics like genes and brain chemistry are not involved.  She 'd tell you  of course the brain is involved  and we need to deal with that  sometimes with medication. But overlooked in the West's heavy emphasis on the biological definition of madness and other mental illnesses is how vital social connections are to the experience of mental illness. When people have mental illness in the U.S.  especially if it's a psychotic disorder like schizophrenia  one of the first things that happens is their social networks fall apart and they're left alone precisely at the time when they most need social connections. If you start to understand these things  it should change how you think society\u00e2\u0080\u0094friends and family  the broader culture  as well as the medical culture\u00e2\u0080\u0094should evaluate and respond to someone experiencing first-episode psychosis.\n Nev Jones  told you about how a mass shooting involving someone diagnosed with schizophrenia shaped others' perceptions of  her  during  her  first episode  while  she  was in graduate school. What does the media tend to get wrong about incidents like the one in Las Vegas just this week? We don't know anything about the shooter's motives yet  but the conversation on social media has quickly turned to mental illness  per usual.\nWhere did the conventional wisdom that folks like  Nev  are trying to revise come from? Describe the intellectual history you explored for this piece.\nAside from the constant warfare over funding for health care in Congress? In the psychiatry establishment\u00e2\u0080\u0094the American Psychiatric Association  for instance\u00e2\u0080\u0094there is a heightened awareness with every passing year. That's one of the main goals for  Nev Jones  and other people who advocate along these lines: to increase awareness among the psychiatric establishment  partly so the establishment is more open to making people with lived experience meaningful and full partners in any organization that makes decisions about how to respond to mental health\u00e2\u0080\u0094whether it be a board that's trying to help create a first episode psychosis clinic  or a clinic that is going to treat or work with psychotic people. Right now  if you have psychosis and you're in this profession  it's seen as a reason not to include you in treatment level activity  whereas it should actually be seen as a plus  because of the greater understanding and credibility that you'll have with a patient. It's encouraging that the APA is looking at this more.", "output": "Positive", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

Shamed and pilloried  the head of the Russian Olympic Committee resigned and Russian leadership spoke of serious reform. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe place we got in Vancouver is not worthy of our country \u00e2\u0080\u009d said then-sports minister and Putin friend Vitaly Mutko. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have to do everything we can to restore our leadership in world sports.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He promised to take \u00e2\u0080\u009cpersonal control\u00e2\u0080\u009d over the preparations for the Sochi Olympics  where the stakes would be far higher and which were just four years away. What if Russian athletes flopped on their home turf? It was a nightmare scenario. This is how we got to Tuesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ban of the entire Russian team and various Russian officials  including Mutko  from the 2018 Winter Olympics  just two months before the opening ceremony in South Korea. There is a straight line from Vancouver to Pyeongchang  with a sordid stop in Sochi. * * * Authoritarian regimes love organized sporting events  like the Olympics  and Russia was one of the initiators of that love affair  back when it was the Soviet Union. For decades  the Kremlin poured money into Olympic sports. It was an important piece of propaganda for both the world and the Soviet home front: We are a superpower and our people are superpeople. Parents eagerly turned over their children to Olympic factories that would make their young ones into athletes who could do their country proud  and get their families a little extra something  be it more food or Western electronics. Olympic events like the famed 1980 hockey match between the Unites States and the Soviet Union\u00e2\u0080\u0094known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Miracle on Ice\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094offered easy analogies for larger geopolitical struggles. To be a true global power  you had to defeat your enemies in every arena.\nPutin  like most people who survived the Soviet Union  never lost that vision of the Olympics as a proxy for geopolitics. It is why the flop at the 2010 Olympics stunned and humiliated Russia as much as it did. Russia looked in the mirror and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like what it saw. It found that despite a decade of unprecedented economic good fortune  of surging oil prices and rising salaries  of the glitz and glamour of its cities  the country was rotten at its core. In the two decades since the collapse of the Soviet Union  its infrastructure had crumbled and was never rebuilt. The glitz  it turned out  was just a patina of false prosperity.  Mutko  was unsparing in  his  assessment when the Olympic delegation returned  humiliated  to Moscow. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are a lot of problems \u00e2\u0080\u009d  he  said in March 2010. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOver the years  we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve frittered away our sport science and lost our human potential.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  He  noted that foreign athletes were trained by Russian coaches who had left Russia  and that in many sports  there was no new generation waiting in the wings. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also the problem of doping \u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSome of us can no longer think of preparing athletes without including doping substances. We began to fight doping with more conviction.\u00e2\u0080\u009d All of these  he said  \u00e2\u0080\u009care systemic problems\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the Sports Ministry was working to solve them. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNeither I nor the Ministry of Sport deny our responsibility for the performance of the Russian team at the Olympics in Vancouver \u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will do a serious analysis  and there will be changes  both in terms of organization and personnel  on the basis of our experience in Vancouver.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAn analysis did come  just four months later and in the form of an audit from the Russian Treasury. It found that one of the reasons for the Russian failures in Vancouver was  Mutko  and the way he spent ministerial finances. In fact   Mutko  had spent so much money on himself\u00e2\u0080\u0094$1 400-a-night hotel rooms for 20 days  during which he had an astonishing 97 breakfasts\u00e2\u0080\u0094that there was little left for the actual athletes and their support staff  many of whom traveled to Vancouver on their own dime.  Mutko  may have spoken that spring about  his  responsibility  but  he  took none this time. Any big organization will have its problems   Mutko  said when the report came out  but \u00e2\u0080\u009cI see a system that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nearly ideal ... I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see a single problem. You couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t possibly call 17 fourth-place finishes an ineffective use of funds!\u00e2\u0080\u009d In other words  with the home-game Olympics just three and a half years away   Mutko  had fixed everything\u00e2\u0080\u0094the rotten infrastructure  the lack of incoming talent  the \u00c3\u00a9migr\u00c3\u00a9 coaches  the widespread doping\u00e2\u0080\u0094in just four months. By the time the closing ceremony began in all its splendor in Sochi in February 2014  the Russian team had won the medal count. * * * We now know how  Mutko  was able to achieve that jump  from 11th place to first  in such a short amount of time: an extensive  state-sponsored doping campaign. After a German documentary interviewed two Russian athletes who had fled Russia and had become whistleblowers about how systematically Russia dopes its athletes  key figures in the world of Russian anti-doping started turning up dead under mysterious circumstances. This prompted Grigory Rodchenkov  the head of the Russian anti-doping agency  to flee  fearing for his life  to Los Angeles and to the director Bryan Fogel. The two had been working together on Fogel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s riveting documentary  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIcarus \u00e2\u0080\u009d about how easy it is for an athlete to dope and test clean. Rodchenkov  who had been coaching Fogel in his quest to dope for a cycling event and dupe the tests  decided to confess to Fogel  on camera. He also told his story to The New York Times  and then went into U.S. government witness protection.\nRodchenkov ran the lab at Sochi during the Winter Olympics  and what he did there was essentially what he did for Fogel  but on a more massive scale: helping dozens of athletes dope all through the Games while testing negative on every single test. The story he told to the Times and to Fogel would strain the imagination  were it not independently confirmed by two investigations: one by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and one by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Here is the summary of the operation  from the Times: The director  Grigory Rodchenkov  who ran the laboratory that handled testing for thousands of Olympians  said he developed a three-drug cocktail of banned substances that he mixed with liquor and provided to dozens of Russian athletes  helping to facilitate one of the most elaborate\u00e2\u0080\u0094and successful\u00e2\u0080\u0094doping ploys in sports history. It involved some of Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest stars of the Games  including 14 members of its cross-country ski team and two veteran bobsledders who won two golds. In a dark-of-night operation  Russian antidoping experts and members of the intelligence service surreptitiously replaced urine samples tainted by performance-enhancing drugs with clean urine collected months earlier  somehow breaking into the supposedly tamper-proof bottles that are the standard at international competitions  Dr. Rodchenkov said. For hours each night  they worked in a shadow laboratory lit by a single lamp  passing bottles of urine through a hand-size hole in the wall  to be ready for testing the next day  he said. By the end of the Games  Dr. Rodchenkov estimated  as many as 100 dirty urine samples were expunged. None of the athletes were caught doping. More important  Russia won the most medals of the Games  easily surpassing its main rival  the United States  and undermining the integrity of one of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most prestigious sporting events. All of this  Rodchenkov said  was overseen by an officer of the federal security services  the FSB  and had the approval of  Mutko  and Putin.", "output": "Negative", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

Any pretense that their intent to visit the White House was apolitical was rapidly debunked by Trump's gleeful tweet praising them as a \"great team.\"\nThis wishful thinking disappeared when  Crosby  was found to have told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette  he  saw the visit \"as an opportunity.\" But  he  also said there had been \"little to no discussion\" in the locker room about the decision to go.\n\"I'm pretty aware of what's going on \"  Crosby  told the Post-Gazette. \"People have that right to not go  too. Nobody's saying they have to go. As a group  we decided to go. There hasn't really been a whole lot of discussion about it.\"\nSidney Crosby  a 30-year-old man and hometown hero in Nova Scotia  has been defended by apologists who suggested that as a Canadian  he simply did not understand race issues in America. Canada  they argue  does not have the same issues with race.\nRacism is a problem in the NHL.  Sidney Crosby  the sport's biggest name   had a chance to speak  not only in support of  his  colleagues in football and basketball  but for players like Dustin Byfuglien.\nThis is a league where PK Subban played in front of Montreal fans who went to games in blackface  and where  he  was memorably accused of not playing the \"white\" way (a telling slip). A league where Evander Kane endured vicious racism in Winnipeg  the town famously called Canada's most racist city by Maclean's magazine. Where even Jarome Iginla\u2014the model for many respectable  humble  black athletes\u2014experienced racism severe enough that his mother spoke out about it. Wayne Simmonds  a descendent of African Nova Scotians  had a banana thrown at him on the ice.\nRacism is a problem in the NHL.  Sidney Crosby  the sport's biggest name   had a chance to speak  not only in support of  his  colleagues in football and basketball  but for players like Dustin Byfuglien. Byfuglien was the only black player on the USA roster at the World Cup of Hockey  where coach John Tortorella threatened to bench any player who protested during the anthem. That tournament was played in Toronto  where Black Lives Matter protesters have taken numerous actions to protest police killings and carding of black people. The children of Toronto's significant population of African and Caribbean immigrants are the hockey players of the future  the future roommates of white players who will ride with them on the bus  buddy with them  and then let them know that when it comes down to it  their lives do not matter.", "output": "Positive", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

'Flippy' The Fast Food Robot (Sort Of) Mans The Grill At Caliburger\nAfter months of practice in the art of fast food preparation   \"Flippy  \" has finally taken up a position as grill cook on the line at Caliburger's Pasadena  Calif.  restaurant.\nEven so  it could be the beginning of a bright career for  Flippy  in an industry that is otherwise notorious for high employee turnover.\nIt certainly helps that Flippy  a burger-flipping robot developed by Miso Robotics  shows no concern about the low wages  meager benefits or long hours that plague the industry. The robot is reportedly capable of grilling 150 burgers per hour.\nAccording to a press release from Miso  the company \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which bills  Flippy  as the world's first burger-flipping robot \u00e2\u0080\u0094 began working with Caliburger two years ago to develop  it  as a \"cost-effective and highly efficient solution\" that is \"specifically designed to operate in an existing commercial kitchen layout and to serve alongside kitchen staff to safely and efficiently fulfill a variety of cooking tasks.\"\n\"The kitchen of the future will always have people in it  but we see that kitchen as having people and robots \" said David Zito  co-founder and CEO of Miso Robotics tells KTLA in Los Angeles. \"This technology is not about replacing jobs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we see  Flippy  as that third hand.\"\nIn  its  current version   Flippy  needs a human coworker to place the patties on the grill  put the cheese on top at the right moment and add the extras  such as lettuce and sauce before wrapping the sandwiches for customers.\n\" The Flippy robot  takes the form of a relatively small  wheeled cart equipped with a 6-axis robotic arm and what Miso Robotics calls a 'sensor bar ' TechCrunch writes. \"It takes in data from thermal sensors  3-D sensors and different cameras onboard to perceive its environment. Digital systems that send tickets from the counter back to the kitchen give  Flippy   its  orders.\"\nTechCrunch says unlike rival burger bots under development  such as one made by Momentum Machines   Flippy  uses artificial intelligence to improve  its  technique \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so the more  it  works  the better  it  gets at the job  in much the same way that might be expected from a human worker.\n The website  adds: \"A range of different tools  like detachable grippers  tongs and scrapers  help  Flippy  to cook burgers made to order  and keep a grill operating smoothly. A pneumatic pump allows  the robot  to swap out its own tools. Combined with Miso Robotics' AI  this range of tools will allow  Flippy  to make more than burgers over time  including chicken  bacon  grilled onions and other items that tend to be served in burger restaurants.\"\nAs part of its deal with Miso  Caliburger gets exclusive rights to use the services of  Flippy  for six months  but thereafter  other fast-food vendors would be allowed to buy  the robot . In  its  current form   Flippy  runs about $60 000 per unit  but the price could go up as  it  becomes more sophisticated and versatile.\nFor now   the robot  is operating only in a single Pasadena  Calif.  Caliburger restaurant  but the chain has plans for expansion within the U.S. after a trial period.\nAlthough Miso and Caliburger emphasize that  Flippy  will be part of an integrated  part-robot  part-human  kitchen  according to a report by the McKinsey Global Institute last year  fast food was among the industries most vulnerable to automation.", "output": "Positive", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}]
