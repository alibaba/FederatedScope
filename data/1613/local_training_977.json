You get what you pay for and this is a trash product. What you get is hex head bolts without the hex head cores cut Update: I went to Home Depot and after 15 minutes of searching the hardware aisle, found a specialty bolt with fine thread that would do the trick. Got home, went to put it in and then found the seat frame was defective too. There\u2019s no threaded place drilled on that side for the bolt. I guess I could try and drill all the way through the seat frame, pick a longer bolt and cap it with a washer and nut. But this frame is so small it would be almost impossible to drill it perfectly straight and not completely damage the integrity of the chair. At this point, my best course of action may be to spend another 45 minutes disassembling and repackaging something that is 95% complete, wasting more time taking it to the UPS store, and get my money back. I\u2019ll only be out the cost of gas, a new bolt and way too much of my time. But in return I\u2019ll be able to at least convey to the rest of Amazon shoppers not to buy this piece of crap or anything by the company that made it. \n Summary: Defective hardware/ defective frame, JUNK PRODUCT!", "output": "True", "category": "Summarization 426.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given reviews from Amazon's food products and a summary of that review.

I wish I could give it less. Awful customer service. Had to file a claim with Amazon, who, fortunately, is working to assist and make it right. TL; DR: Seller sent a COMPLETELY different item than ordered, the tried to charge me to package/send said 7-8 foot item back to them in order to get a refund. My shipping/packing charges would have been over the price of the original item I ordered. My order: a small, 3-piece patio bistro foldable furniture set. What arrived: a 7-8 foot giant rocking outdoor swing of some kind. Incredibly heavy. 1) I contacted customer service to alert them of the mistakenly shipped item. 2) After months of communicating with their customer service team, requesting my original order, it still never came. 3) I contacted Amazon for help, as the seller refused to cooperate and provide a solution (i.e. a refund, my original order, or means of shipping the incorrect product back at no cost to me.) Worth noting - the packaging the original item arrived in was completely damaged and unusable (leaving scratches and bangs on the incorrect item as well). Best Choice Products customer service team is continuing to ask me to mail the item back (which would involve me purchasing the packing materials for a 7-8 foot item, and paying someone to take it to UPS, as I can't lift this item or fit it in my vehicle). Their solution? Customer service replied with \"see if your friends can give you some free boxes or help you move it.\" Their other solution, \"You can pay FedEx to pick it up.\" No, this isn't my responsibility as a customer to pay to fix a mistake on the company's end or to pay more than my original item cost to return their mistake.

Well after about a month I started getting complaints from friends that they would try to call me and would get a disconnected line message. I contacted BLU about this and tried of few of their steps to solve the issue and eventually had to send out the phone. After 5 weeks I got my phone back and tested it, again I was not able to receive calls. I should mentions that I tested the sim card on my LG and everything worked fine. so I contacted BLU again and told them I was still having issues, after jumping through the same hoops with hard reset etc. they finally agreed that my phone might be faulty. I received a new phone after 5 weeks and everything seemed to be working correctly, now I'm starting to get the same complaints from friends and family that they can't call me. I'm just fed up with this phone and looking into buying a real phone from a real manufacturer.
