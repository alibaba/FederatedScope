Diazepam is known to supplement atropine therapy, but its specific mechanism of action is uncertain.', 'To test four centrally acting agents for early antidotal efficacy in severe dichlorvos poisoning in the murine model.', 'The up-and-down method was used to dose four candidate antidotes: diazepam, xylazine, morphine, and ketamine. Antidotes were administered subcutaneously to unsedated adult Sprague-Dawley rats who were pretreated with 3 mg/kg intraperitoneal glycopyrrolate. All animals received 20 mg/kg of dichlorvos subcutaneously 5 minutes later. A blinded observer adjudicated the outcomes of 10-minute mortality and survival time.', 'All animals pretreated with either no antidote (8/8 deaths) or glycopyrrolate alone (8/8) died within 10 minutes of dichlorvos injection. Pretreatment with diazepam (3/9 deaths), or xylazine (3/9), decreased lethality substantially (Fisher p = 0.007; median effective doses, 0.12 mg/kg and 3.0 mg/kg, respectively). Intermediate doses of morphine (3.1 to 5.5 mg/kg) resulted in survival, but higher doses did not, presumably because of excessive respiratory depression (7/11 deaths; p = 0.09). Ketamine (7/8 deaths) was ineffective as an antidote. Survival times also were prolonged in the diazepam and xylazine groups (log-rank p < 0.001) and, to a lesser degree, the morphine group (p = 0.07).\nAnswer: Doses of diazepam, xylazine, and morphine below those used for deep sedation protect against severe dichlorvos poisoning, implying that several distinct central mechanisms are each sufficient to avert lethality.

Inflammatory metastatic forms have been reported with Leishmania species such as L. braziliensis, guyanensis and aethiopica. Little is known about the factors underlying such exacerbated clinical presentations. Leishmania RNA virus (LRV) is mainly found within South American Leishmania braziliensis and guyanensis. In a mouse model of L. guyanensis infection, its presence is responsible for an hyper-inflammatory response driven by the recognition of the viral dsRNA genome by the host Toll-like Receptor 3 leading to an exacerbation of the disease. In one instance, LRV was reported outside of South America, namely in the L. major ASKH strain from Turkmenistan, suggesting that LRV appeared before the divergence of Leishmania subgenera. LRV presence inside Leishmania parasites could be one of the factors implicated in disease severity, providing rationale for LRV screening in L. aethiopica.', 'A new LRV member was identified in four L. aethiopica strains (LRV-Lae). Three LRV-Lae genomes were sequenced and compared to L. guyanensis LRV1 and L. major LRV2. LRV-Lae more closely resembled LRV2. Despite their similar genomic organization, a notable difference was observed in the region where the capsid protein and viral polymerase open reading frames overlap, with a unique -1 situation in LRV-Lae. In vitro infection of murine macrophages showed that LRV-Lae induced a TLR3-dependent inflammatory response as previously observed for LRV1.\nAnswer: In this study, we report the presence of an immunogenic dsRNA virus in L. aethiopica human isolates. This is the first observation of LRV in Africa, and together with the unique description of LRV2 in Turkmenistan, it confirmed that LRV was present before the divergence of the L.

Our primary objective was to document the incidence of HIV infection in children who presented with a surgical emergency to a major pediatric surgical unit in South Africa. If possible, we aimed to provide a description of the impact of the disease in a surgical pediatric population and to raise awareness of the mode of presentation of HIV to the pediatric surgeon in a developing nation, now that specific antiretroviral therapies are available.', 'This was a prospective observational study of consecutive surgical emergency admissions to the Division of Paediatric Surgery at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa, between April 1 and May 31, 2005. Consent for inclusion in the study was sought in all cases. The clinical profile of children presenting during the study period was recorded. If relevant, permission was sought from the parent/guardian to undertake HIV status testing if this were not already known.', 'Three hundred ninety-one children were admitted as emergency cases during the study period. Thirty-seven (9.5%) of 391 were excluded, because consent could not be obtained, leaving 354 children. Ages ranged between 1 day and 17 years, with a median age of 3 years. The diagnosis in most was trauma/burns (42%) and abdominal emergencies (27%). Infections occurred in 13% of these patients. Human immunodeficiency virus status was already known in 10 (3%) of 354 patients, and only 18 (5%) of 344 children were tested; of these, 10 (55%) were positive. As expected, the predominant surgical presentation of HIV positive children was sepsis. The prevalence of HIV/AIDS in those children not tested is unknown.\nAnswer: It is likely that the incidence of HIV/AIDS infection is higher than the 4% identified in our study group. The surgical manifestations in these HIV-positive children are dominated by sepsis, often severe in nature and with opportunistic pathogens. Despite increased knowledge about the disease and widening therapeutic opportunities, our results suggest that many children with HIV infection are not being recognized, despite entry into the healthcare system. Prompt recognition and surgical management of the complications of pediatric HIV infection can sometimes result in a good outcome. Further studies are therefore required to define the true incidence of HIV/AIDS infection in children presenting as a surgical emergency case.

Orchids and asclepiads are particularly at risk as their pollen is packaged as pollinia and so can be deposited on self-stigmas en masse. Many orchids and asclepiads have adaptations to limit self-deposition of pollinia, including gradual reconfiguration of pollinaria following removal. Here an unusual mechanism--anther cap retention--that appears to prevent self-pollination in the South African orchid Eulophia foliosa is examined.', 'Visits to inflorescences in the field were observed and pollinators collected. Visitation rates to transplanted inflorescences were compared between a site where putative pollinators were abundant and a site where they were rare. Anther cap retention times were determined for removed pollinaria and atmospheric vapour pressure deficit was recorded concurrently. Anther cap anatomy was examined using light microscopy.', 'Eulophia foliosa is pollinated almost exclusively by Cardiophorus obliquemaculatus (Elateridae) beetles, which remain on the deceptive inflorescences for on average 301 s (n = 18). The anther cap that covers the pollinarium is retained for an average of 512 s (n = 24) after pollinarium removal by beetles. In all populations measured, anther cap dimensions are greater than those of the stigmatic cavity, thus precluding the deposition of self-pollinia until after the anther cap has dropped. An anatomical investigation of this mechanism suggests that differential water loss from regions of the anther cap results in opening of the anther cap flaps. This is supported by observations that as atmospheric vapour pressure deficits increased, the duration of anther cap retention was reduced.\nAnswer: Flowers of E. foliosa are specialized for pollination by elaterid beetles. Retention of anther caps for a period exceeding average visit times by beetles to inflorescences appears to prevent facilitated self-pollination in E. foliosa effectively.", "output": "Does anther cap retention prevent self-pollination by elaterid beetles in the South African orchid Eulophia foliosa?", "category": "Question Generation 1469.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a passage with a context and an answer, construct a question on the basis of the information present in the passage.

Mechanisms of cisplatin resistance have been extensively investigated, and ERCC1 has emerged as a key player due to its central role in the repair of cisplatin-induced DNA lesions. However, clinical data have not unequivocally confirmed ERCC1 status as a predictor of the response to cisplatin treatment. Therefore, we employed an autochthonous mouse model of Kras-driven lung adenocarcinoma resembling human lung adenocarcinoma to investigate the role of Ercc1 in the response to cisplatin treatment. Our data show that Ercc1 deficiency in Tp53-deficient murine lung adenocarcinoma induces a more aggressive tumor phenotype that displays enhanced sensitivity to cisplatin treatment. Furthermore, tumors that relapsed after cisplatin treatment in our model develop a robust etoposide sensitivity that is independent of the Ercc1 status and depends solely on previous cisplatin exposure. Our results provide a solid rationale for further investigation of the possibility of preselection of lung adenocarcinoma patients according to the functional ERCC1- and mutational TP53 status, where functionally ERCC1-incompetent patients might benefit from sequential cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy.\nAnswer: This study provides a solid rationale for the stratification of lung adenocarcinoma patients according to the functional ERCC1- and mutational TP53 status, where functionally ERCC1-incompetent patients could benefit from sequential cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy.

Therefore with emphasis on starch accumulation, we studied tap-roots of sugar beet using parsnip (Pastinaca sativa) as a comparator.', 'Metabolic and structural analyses of sugar beet tap-root confirmed sucrose as the exclusive storage component. No starch granules could be detected in tap-roots of sugar beet or the wild ancestor sea beet (Beta vulgaris ssp. maritima).

Since neutrophils are important in tissue damage during inflammation, and are elevated as part of the acute phase response, we hypothesised that neutrophil pathways could also be important in the pathogenesis of sJIA. We therefore studied the gene profile in both PBMC and neutrophils of sJIA patients treated with tocilizumab.', 'We studied the transcriptomes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and neutrophils from eight paired samples obtained from 4 sJIA patients taken before and after treatment, selected on the basis that they achieved ACR90 responses within 12 weeks of therapy initiation with tocilizumab.

A longitudinal analysis using paired t-test (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05 and FC\\u2009\u2265\\u20091.5) was applied to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two time points followed by ingenuity pathway analysis.

These collateral vessels can restore up to 60% of the native blood flow. Shear stress and vascular injury can induce the release of nucleotides from vascular smooth muscle cells and platelets that can serve as signaling ligands, suggesting they may be involved in mediating arteriogenesis. The P2Y2 nucleotide receptor (P2Y2R) has also been shown to mediate smooth muscle migration and arterial remodeling. Thus, we hypothesize that P2Y2R mediates arteriogenesis in response to ischemia.', 'Hind limb ischemia was induced by femoral artery ligation (FAL) in C57Bl/6NJ or P2Y2R negative mice (P2Y2(-/-)). Hind limb perfusion was measured with laser Doppler perfusion imaging and compared with the sham-operated contralateral limb immediately and at 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after ligation. Collateral vessel size was measured by Microfil casting. Muscle specimens were harvested and analyzed with immunohistochemistry for Ki67, vascular cell adhesion molecule, macrophages, and muscle viability by hematoxylin and essoin stain.', 'Hind limb ischemia induced by FAL in C57Bl/6NJ mice resulted in significant ischemia as measured by laser Doppler perfusion imaging. There was rapid recovery to nearly normal levels of perfusion by 2 weeks. FAL in P2Y2(-/-) mice resulted in severe ischemia with greater tissue loss. Recovery of perfusion was impaired, achieving only 40% compared with wild-type mice by 28 days. Collateral vessels in the P2Y2(-/-) mice were underdeveloped, with reduced vascular cell proliferation and smaller vessel size. The collaterals were \u223c65% the size of wild-type collateral vessels (P = .011). Angiogenesis at 28 days in the ischemic muscle, however, was greater in the P2Y2(-/-) mice (P < .001), possibly related to persistent ischemia leading and angiogenic drive. Early macrophage recruitment was reduced by nearly 70% in P2Y2(-/-) despite significantly more myocyte necrosis. However, inflammation was greater at 28 days in the P2Y2(-/-) mice.\nAnswer: P2Y2R deficiency does not alter baseline collateral vessel formation but does significantly impair collateral maturation, with resultant persistent limb ischemia despite enhanced angiogenesis. These findings reinforce the importance of arteriogenesis in the recovery of perfusion in ischemic tissues compared with angiogenesis. They also support the role of P2Y2R in mediating this process. The mechanism by which P2Y2R mediates arteriogenesis may involve the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the ischemic tissues, which is essential to arteriogenesis.

Deregulated expression of PRL-3 is involved in cancer progression and predicts poor overall survival. Recent studies have revealed critical roles for microRNAs in various cellular processes, including tumorigenic development. In this study, we aimed to explore the linkage between PRL-3 and microRNAs in gastric cancer. We found that PRL-3 transcript levels were positively correlated with miR-210 levels in gastric cancer tissues. In gastric cancer cells, PRL-3 upregulated miR-210 expression in a HIF-1\u03b1-dependent fashion under normoxia and hypoxia. In addition, PRL-3 activated NF-\u03baB signaling and promoted HIF-1\u03b1 expression through modulating phosphorylation of p65. NF-\u03baB signaling, HIF-1\u03b1, and miR-210 partially contributed to PRL-3-induced migration and invasion. Furthermore, the levels of PRL-3, HIF-1\u03b1, and miR-210 transcripts inversely affected the overall survival of gastric cancer patients.

Sonography was performed on all patients before, during and after QS. Quinacrine was packaged as seven pellets in a modified Copper-T IUD inserter (Sipharm, Sisseln, Switzerland). Each woman received the first transcervical insertion of 252 mg of quinacrine during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, usually immediately after menses.

Additionally, recent studies indicated that adult heterozygous ((+/neo)) Fgf8 hypomorphic mice exhibit more anxiety-like behaviors than wildtype (WT) mice. These studies led us to investigate whether Fgf8 hypomorphy abrogated VP and/or corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neuronal development in the postnatal day (PN) 21 and adult mouse PVN. Furthermore, we studied whether Fgf8 hypomorphy disrupted HPA responsiveness in these mice.', 'Using immunohistochemistry, we examined the development of VP and CRH neurons located in the PVN of PN 21 and adult Fgf8 (+/neo) mice. Moreover, we used a restraint stress (RS) paradigm and measured corticosterone levels with enzyme immunoassays in order to assess HPA axis activation.', 'The number of VP neurons in the PVN did not differ between WT and Fgf8 (+/neo) mice on PN 21 and in adulthood. In contrast, CRH immunoreactivity was much higher in Fgf8 (+/neo) mice than in WT mice on PN 21, this difference was no longer shown in adult mice. RS caused a higher increase in corticosterone levels in adult Fgf8 (+/neo) mice than in WT mice after 15\\xa0min, but no difference was seen after 45\\xa0min.\nAnswer: First, Fgf8 hypomorphy did not eliminate VP and CRH neurons in the mouse PVN, but rather disrupted the postnatal timing of neuropeptide expression onset in PVN neurons. Second, Fgf8 hypomorphy may, in part, be an explanation for affective disorders involving hyperactivity of the HPA axis, such as anxiety.", "output": "Does fibroblast growth factor 8 regulate postnatal development of paraventricular nucleus neuroendocrine cells?", "category": "Question Generation 1469.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a passage with a context and an answer, construct a question on the basis of the information present in the passage.

For marker subsets, similar patterns were observed but with lower prediction accuracies.\nAnswer: Given the need for high relatedness between CV sets to obtain good prediction accuracies, we recommend to build GS models for prediction within the same breeding population only. Breeding groups could be merged to build genomic prediction models as long as the total effective population size does not exceed 50 individuals in order to obtain high prediction accuracy such as that obtained in the present study. A number of markers limited to a few hundred would not negatively impact prediction accuracies, but these could decrease more rapidly over generations. The most promising short-term approach for genomic selection would likely be the selection of superior individuals within large full-sib families vegetatively propagated to implement multiclonal forestry.", "output": "Do genomic selection accuracies within and between environments and small breeding groups in white spruce?", "category": "Question Generation 1469.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a passage with a context and an answer, construct a question on the basis of the information present in the passage.

Thirty-six male patients were investigated. As a control group, 72 female patients were matched for age and preoperative stage of osteoarthritis at the time of surgery. We evaluated operative time and blood loss, radiographic parameters, Harris Hip Score (HHS) and survival rate. We investigated the clinical and radiographic differences between men and women.', 'The mean operative time was 148 min in males and 135 min in females. The bleeding during surgery was 445 g in males and 351 g in females. HHS improved 94.1 points in males and 93.5 points in women postoperatively.

However, the specific HDAC that might serve as a therapeutic target and the associated upstream and downstream molecules involved in regulating hypertension remain unknown. Our study was aimed at investigating whether a selective inhibitor of class II HDAC (MC1568) modulates hypertension, elucidating the underlying mechanism.', 'Hypertension was established by administering angiotensin II (Ang II) to mice before treatment with MC1568. SBP was measured.', \"Treatment with MC1568 reduced elevated SBP; attenuated arterial remodeling in the kidney's small arteries and thoracic aorta; and inhibited cell cycle regulatory gene expression, vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation, DNA synthesis, and VSMC hypertrophy in vivo and in vitro. Ang II enhanced the expression of phosphorylated HDAC4 and GATA-binding factor 6 (GATA6) proteins, which were specifically localized in the cytoplasm of cells in the arteries of kidneys and in aortas. Forced expression and knockdown of HDAC4 increased and decreased, respectively, the proliferation and expression of cell cycle genes in VSMCs. GATA6, a newly described binding partner of HDAC4, markedly enhanced the size and number of VSMCs. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II\u03b1 (CaMKII\u03b1), but not HDAC4, translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to Ang II. CaMKII\u03b1 and protein kinase D1 were associated with VSMC hypertrophy and hyperplasia via direct interaction with HDAC4. MC1568 treatment weakened the association between HDAC4 and CaMKII\u03b1.\nAnswer: These results suggest that class II HDAC inhibition attenuates hypertension by negatively regulating VSMC hypertrophy and hyperplasia via the CaMKII\u03b1/protein kinase D1/HDAC4/GATA6 pathway.", "output": "Do histone deacetylase and GATA-binding factor 6 regulate arterial remodeling in angiotensin II-induced hypertension?", "category": "Question Generation 1469.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a passage with a context and an answer, construct a question on the basis of the information present in the passage.

Follow-up data were available on all patients with SCC, and 67 CIN lesions were monitored by serial PCR for clearance or persistence of HPV after cone treatment.', 'A linear decrease (p = 0.001) was observed in nm23-H1 expression, starting from CIN1 (85% with normal expression), with the most dramatic down regulation on transition from CIN2 (70% normal) to CIN3 (39%) and further to SCC (25%). Reduced expression was associated with CIN3 or cancer at an odds ratio 8.72 (95% confidence interval 4.13 to 18.41). Nm23-H1 was of no use as a marker of the high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) type, and it did not predict clearance or persistence of HR-HPV after treatment of CIN. Importantly, nm23-H1 expression was a significant prognostic factor in cervical cancer, reduced expression being associated with lower survival (p = 0.022) in univariate analysis. In the multivariate (Cox) regression model, however, only the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage (p = 0.001) and age (p = 0.011) remained independent prognostic predictors.\nAnswer: Down-regulated nm23-H1 expression is markedly associated with progression from CIN2 to CIN3, and predicts poor prognosis in cervical cancer.

A\u03b2 is produced by sequential cleavage of the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) by \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases. Many studies have demonstrated that the internalization of APP from the cell surface can regulate A\u03b2 production, although the exact organelle in which A\u03b2 is produced remains contentious. A number of recent studies suggest that intracellular trafficking also plays a role in regulating A\u03b2 production, but these pathways are relatively under-studied. The goal of this study was to elucidate the intracellular trafficking of APP, and to examine the site of intracellular APP processing.\", 'We have tagged APP on its C-terminal cytoplasmic tail with photoactivatable Green Fluorescent Protein (paGFP). By photoactivating APP-paGFP in the Golgi, using the Golgi marker Galactosyltranferase fused to Cyan Fluorescent Protein (GalT-CFP) as a target, we are able to follow a population of nascent APP molecules from the Golgi to downstream compartments identified with compartment markers tagged with red fluorescent protein (mRFP or mCherry); including rab5 (early endosomes) rab9 (late endosomes) and LAMP1 (lysosomes). Because \u03b3-cleavage of APP releases the cytoplasmic tail of APP including the photoactivated GFP, resulting in loss of fluorescence, we are able to visualize the cleavage of APP in these compartments. Using APP-paGFP, we show that APP is rapidly trafficked from the Golgi apparatus to the lysosome; where it is rapidly cleared. Chloroquine and the highly selective \u03b3-secretase inhibitor, L685, 458, cause the accumulation of APP in lysosomes implying that APP is being cleaved by secretases in the lysosome. The Swedish mutation dramatically increases the rate of lysosomal APP processing, which is also inhibited by chloroquine and L685, 458. By knocking down adaptor protein 3 (AP-3; a heterotetrameric protein complex required for trafficking many proteins to the lysosome) using siRNA, we are able to reduce this lysosomal transport. Blocking lysosomal transport of APP reduces A\u03b2 production by more than a third.\nAnswer: These data suggests that AP-3 mediates rapid delivery of APP to lysosomes, and that the lysosome is a likely site of A\u03b2 production.", "output": "Is the Amyloid Precursor Protein rapidly transported from the Golgi apparatus to the lysosome and where it is processed into beta-amyloid?", "category": "Question Generation 1469.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a passage with a context and an answer, construct a question on the basis of the information present in the passage.

The prototypical NAMPT inhibitor FK866 effectively lowers NAD(+) levels in cancer cells, reducing the activity of NAD(+)-dependent enzymes, lowering intracellular ATP, and promoting cell death.', \"We show that FK866 induces a translational arrest in leukemia cells through inhibition of MTOR/4EBP1 signaling and of the initiation factors EIF4E and EIF2A. Specifically, treatment with FK866 is shown to induce 5'AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, which, together with EIF2A phosphorylation, is responsible for the inhibition of protein synthesis. Notably, such an effect was also observed in patients' derived primary leukemia cells including T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. Jurkat cells in which AMPK or LKB1 expression was silenced or in which a non-phosphorylatable EIF2A mutant was ectopically expressed showed enhanced sensitivity to the NAMPT inhibitor, confirming a key role for the LKB1-AMPK-EIF2A axis in cell fate determination in response to energetic stress via NAD(+) depletion.\nAnswer: We identified EIF2A phosphorylation as a novel early molecular event occurring in response to NAMPT inhibition and mediating protein synthesis arrest.

The mean IL-6 concentration measured via the IL-6 QuickLine for aseptic cases was 410 pg/mL (SD 371 pg/mL, min 100 pg/mL-max 1562 pg/mL). The test showed no false negative or false positive results in the cases tested. In six patients, PJI was considered proven.

However, the underlying mechanisms of these vascular complications are largely unknown. The objective of this study was to test a novel hypothesis that HIV Nef, an accessory HIV protein, may directly affect endothelial functions and gene expression in pulmonary arteries.', 'Fresh porcine pulmonary artery rings and human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs) were treated with HIV Nef for 24 h. With a myograph device, vasomotor function was determined with thromboxane A2 analog, U46619, for contraction, bradykinin, and sodium nitroprusside for relaxation. The expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) was determined with real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. Nitric oxide (NO) production was determined by Calorimetric Nitric Oxide Assay kit. Superoxide anion levels were detected with lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence assay and dihydroethidium (DHE) staining.', 'The endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation in response to bradykinin was significantly reduced in HIV Nef-treated porcine pulmonary artery rings in a concentration-dependent manner. In response to bradykinin (10(-8) mol/L), HIV Nef (10 ng/mL) significantly reduced vasorelaxation by 32% compared with untreated controls (P < 0.05). In addition, HIV Nef significantly decreased eNOS expression in the vessels and HPAECs. HIV Nef at 10 ng/mL significantly decreased NO production in HPAECs by 21% compared with controls (P < 0.05). Furthermore, HIV Nef significantly increased superoxide anion production in porcine pulmonary arteries and HPAECs compared with controls (P < 0.05). Consequently, Mn (III) tetrakis porphyrin, a superoxide dismutase mimic, effectively blocked HIV Nef-induced vasomotor dysfunction and superoxide anion production.

Similarly, selective mutation of phospholamban amino acids critical for enhancing SR Ca(2+) uptake by PKA (S16) or CaMKII (T17) to alanines did not affect HR in vivo or in SANC.

Of the remaining patients, 584 patients had detectable ethanol concentrations (ethanol-positive), and 353 had no detectable ethanol (ethanol-negative). Ethanol concentrations (mean +/- SD) in the ethanol-positive group were 50.11 +/- 24.08 mmol/L (231 +/- 111 mg/dL), and glucose concentrations were 5.83 +/- 1.94 mmol/L (105 +/- 35 mg/dL).

A hallmark of LD is cytoplasmic accumulation of insoluble glucans, called Lafora bodies (LBs). Mutations in the gene encoding the phosphatase laforin account for approximately 50% of LD cases, and this gene is conserved in all vertebrates. We recently demonstrated that laforin is the founding member of a unique class of phosphatases that dephosphorylate glucans.', 'Herein, we identify laforin orthologs in a protist and two invertebrate genomes, and report that laforin is absent in the vast majority of protozoan genomes and it is lacking in all other invertebrate genomes sequenced to date. We biochemically characterized recombinant proteins from the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis and the amphioxus Branchiostoma floridae to demonstrate that they are laforin orthologs. We demonstrate that the laforin gene has a unique evolutionary lineage; it is conserved in all vertebrates, a subclass of protists that metabolize insoluble glucans resembling LBs, and two invertebrates. We analyzed the intron-exon boundaries of the laforin genes in each organism and determine, based on recently published reports describing rates of molecular evolution in Branchiostoma and Nematostella, that the conservation of laforin is linked to the molecular rate of evolution and the glucan metabolism of an organism.\nAnswer: Our results alter the existing view of glucan phosphorylation/dephosphorylation and strongly suggest that glucan phosphorylation is a multi-Kingdom regulatory mechanism, encompassing at least some invertebrates. These results establish boundaries concerning which organisms contain laforin. Laforin is conserved in all vertebrates, it has been lost in the vast majority of lower organisms, and yet it is an ancient gene that is conserved in a subset of protists and invertebrates that have undergone slower rates of molecular evolution and/or metabolize a carbohydrate similar to LBs.

We hypothesized that strict glucose control with a continuous insulin infusion in the perioperative period would reduce hospital mortality.', 'All patients with diabetes undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 3554) were treated aggressively with either subcutaneous insulin (1987-1991) or with continuous insulin infusion (1992-2001) for hyperglycemia.

Conversely, cardiogenic shock, renal failure, reoperation, nonelective operative status, older age, concomitant peripheral or cerebral vascular disease, decreasing ejection fraction, unstable angina, and history of atrial fibrillation increased the risk of death.

The CCA was transfected with an adenoviral vector incorporating the cytosine deaminase (CD) gene (1 x 10(9) PFU/ml). 5-Fluorocytosine (5-FC), a prodrug that is converted to the radiosensitizing agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) by CD, was thereafter administered intravenously.

THC was shown to selectively inhibit the immediate early ORF 50 gene promoter of KSHV and MHV 68.\nAnswer: THC specifically targets viral and/or cellular mechanisms required for replication and possibly shared by these gamma herpesviruses, and the endocannabinoid system is possibly involved in regulating gamma herpesvirus latency and lytic replication. The immediate early gene ORF 50 promoter activity was specifically inhibited by THC.

Here we compare these organizational effects of perinatal androgens in closely related Nazca (Sula granti) and blue-footed (S. nebouxii) boobies that differ in neonatal social system. The older of two Nazca booby hatchlings unconditionally attacks and ejects the younger from the nest within days of hatching, while blue-footed booby neonates lack lethal aggression. Both Nazca booby chicks facultatively upregulate testosterone (T) during fights, motivating the prediction that baseline androgen levels differ between obligately siblicidal and other species.', 'We show that obligately siblicidal Nazca boobies hatch with higher circulating androgen levels than do facultatively siblicidal blue-footed boobies, providing comparative evidence of the role of androgens in sociality. Although androgens confer a short-term benefit of increased aggression to Nazca booby neonates, exposure to elevated androgen levels during this sensitive period in development can also induce long-term organizational effects on behavior or morphology. Adult Nazca boobies show evidence of organizational effects of early androgen exposure in aberrant adult behavior: they visit unattended non-familial chicks in the colony and direct mixtures of aggression, affiliative, and sexual behavior toward them. In a longitudinal analysis, we found that the most active Non-parental Adult Visitors (NAVs) were those with a history of siblicidal behavior as a neonate, suggesting that the tendency to show social interest in chicks is programmed, in part, by the high perinatal androgens associated with obligate siblicide. Data from closely related blue-footed boobies provide comparative support for this interpretation. Lacking obligate siblicide, they hatch with a corresponding low androgen level, and blue-footed booby adults show a much lower frequency of NAV behavior and a lower probability of behaving aggressively during NAV interactions. This species difference in adult social behavior appears to have roots in both pleiotropic and experiential effects of nestling social system.\nAnswer: Our results indicate that Nazca boobies experience life-long consequences of androgenic preparation for an early battle to the death.", "output": "Do perinatal androgens and adult behavior vary with nestling social system in siblicidal boobies?", "category": "Question Generation 1469.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a passage with a context and an answer, construct a question on the basis of the information present in the passage.

This study sought to test whether Nrf2, a transcription factor, mediated LPS-induced preconditioning.', 'The TSCI model was established using a standardized NYU impactor on adult female rats. Rats were pretreated with LPS (0.2mg/kg, IP; 72h before injury). Nrf2 was silenced by injecting a lentivirus encoding RNAi against Nrf2 into injured spinal cords. Neurologic function was assessed by Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) scores 6h, 12h, 24h, 48h, 72h, 7d and 14d after TSCI. Neuronal apoptosis was measured by a TUNEL staining. Ultrastructure was observed using transmission electron microscope (TEM). The protein expression of HO-1, NQO1 and GCLC was examined using immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting.', 'The injection of a lentivirus effectively transfected GFP into injured spinal cords. The expression of Nrf2 was significantly decreased in spinal cords receiving a lentivirus encoding RNAi against Nrf2. BBB scores showed that TSCI markedly impaired nervous function, which was markedly preserved by LPS pretreatment. Nrf2 knockdown significantly suppressed LPS pretreatment-induced protection of nervous function. TEM images and TUNEL staining showed an increase in apoptotic cells when Nrf2 was silenced. Moreover, immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting analysis exhibited that LPS pretreatment significantly upregulated the expression of anti-oxidative proteins including HO-1, NQO1 and GCLC, which was suppressed when Nrf2 expression was silenced in injured spinal cords.\nAnswer: LPS preconditioning effectively alleviates TSCI-induced impairment and preserves nervous function in a Nrf2-dependent manner.", "output": "Does lipopolysaccharide-induced preconditioning protect against traumatic spinal cord injury by upregulating Nrf2 expression in rats?", "category": "Question Generation 1469.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a passage with a context and an answer, construct a question on the basis of the information present in the passage.

In the first four species it has been demonstrated that disruption of this two-component system leads to a clear reduction in virulence of the bacteria. Our aim was to determine if the Escherichia coli BarA-UvrY two-component system is connected with virulence using a monkey cystitis model.', 'Cystitis was generated in Macaque fascularis monkeys by infecting the bladder with a 1:1 mixture of the uropathogenic Escherichia coli isolate DS17 and a derivative where the uvrY gene had been disrupted with a kanamycin resistance gene. Urine was collected through bladder punctuation at subsequent time intervals and the relative amount of uvrY mutant was determined. This showed that inactivation of the UvrY response regulator leads to a reduced fitness. In similar competitions in culture flasks with Luria Broth (LB) the uvrY mutant rather had a higher fitness than the wild type. When the competitions were done in flasks with human urine the uvrY mutant initially had a lower fitness. This was followed by a fluctuation in the level of mutant in the long-term culture, with a pattern that was specific for the individual urines that were tested. Addition of LB to the different urine competition cultures however clearly led to a consistently higher fitness of the uvrY mutant.\nAnswer: This paper demonstrates that the BarA-UvrY two-component system is a determinant for virulence in a monkey cystitis model. The observed competition profiles strengthen our previous hypothesis that disruption of the BarA-UvrY two-component system impairs the ability of the bacteria to switch between different carbon sources. The urine in the bladder contains several different carbon sources and its composition changes over time. Inability to efficiently switch between the carbon sources may thus provide an explanation to the reduced fitness of the uvrY mutant in the cystitis model.", "output": "Is the Escherichia coli BarA-UvrY two-component system a virulence determinant in the urinary tract?", "category": "Question Generation 1469.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a passage with a context and an answer, construct a question on the basis of the information present in the passage.

GATA3 mutations are frequent in breast cancer and have been classified as driver mutations. To elucidate the contribution(s) of GATA3 alterations to cancer, we studied two breast cancer cell lines, MCF7, which carries a heterozygous frameshift mutation in the second zinc finger of GATA3, and T47D, wild-type at this locus.', 'Immunofluorescence staining and subcellular fractionation were employed to verify cellular localization of GATA3 in T47D and MCF7 cells. To test protein stability, cells were treated with translation inhibitor, cycloheximide or proteasome inhibitor, MG132, and GATA3 abundance was measured over time using immunoblot. GATA3 turn-over in response to hormone was determined by treating the cells with estradiol or ER\u03b1 agonist, ICI 182,780. DNA binding ability of recombinant GATA3 was evaluated using electrophoretic mobility shift assay and heparin chromatography. Genomic location of GATA3 in MCF7 and T47D cells was assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq).', 'GATA3 localized in the nucleus in T47D and MCF7 cells, regardless of the mutation status. The truncated protein in MCF7 had impaired interaction with chromatin and was easily released from the nucleus. Recombinant mutant GATA3 was able to bind DNA to a lesser degree than the wild-type protein. Heterozygosity for the truncating mutation conferred protection from regulated turnover of GATA3, ER\u03b1 and FOXA1 following estrogen stimulation in MCF7 cells. Thus, mutant GATA3 uncoupled protein-level regulation of master regulatory transcription factors from hormone action. Consistent with increased protein stability, ChIP-seq profiling identified greater genome-wide accumulation of GATA3 in MCF7 cells bearing the mutation, albeit with a similar distribution across the genome, comparing to T47D cells.\nAnswer: We propose that this specific, cancer-derived mutation in GATA3 deregulates physiologic protein turnover, stabilizes GATA3 binding across the genome and modulates the response of breast cancer cells to estrogen signaling.", "output": "Does breast tumor specific mutation in GATA3 affect physiological mechanisms regulating transcription factor turnover?", "category": "Question Generation 1469.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a passage with a context and an answer, construct a question on the basis of the information present in the passage.

We tested the hypothesis that allograft rejection and recurrent autoimmunity contribute to this progressive loss of islet allograft function.', 'Twenty-one T1D patients received cultured islet cell grafts prepared from multiple donors and transplanted under anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) induction and tacrolimus plus mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) maintenance immunosuppression. Immunity against auto- and alloantigens was measured before and during one year after transplantation. Cellular auto- and alloreactivity was assessed by lymphocyte stimulation tests against autoantigens and cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursor assays, respectively. Humoral reactivity was measured by auto- and alloantibodies. Clinical outcome parameters--including time until insulin independence, insulin independence at one year, and C-peptide levels over one year--remained blinded until their correlation with immunological parameters. All patients showed significant improvement of metabolic control and 13 out of 21 became insulin-independent. Multivariate analyses showed that presence of cellular autoimmunity before and after transplantation is associated with delayed insulin-independence (p = 0.001 and p = 0.01, respectively) and lower circulating C-peptide levels during the first year after transplantation (p = 0.002 and p = 0.02, respectively).

Understanding the mechanisms behind this may reveal new therapeutic strategies to modulate intestinal function in disease states such as diabetes and obesity, as well as short bowel syndrome. Although diurnal rhythms have been amply documented for several intestinal transporters, the complexity of transepithelial transport has precluded definitive attribution of rhythmicity in glucose uptake to a single transporter.

Among the most important and broadly studied of these roles is reversible phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II, part of a complex array of CTD/protein interactions that coordinate the RNAP II transcription cycle. The RNAP CTD is strongly conserved in some groups of eukaryotes, but highly degenerate or absent in others; the reasons for these differences in stabilizing selection on CTD structure are not clear. Given the importance of reversible phosphorylation for CTD-based transcription, the distribution and evolutionary history of CDKs may be a key to understanding differences in constraints on CTD structure; however, the origins and evolutionary relationships of CTD kinases have not been investigated thoroughly. Moreover, although the functions of most CDKs are reasonably well studied in mammals and yeasts, very little is known from most other eukaryotes.', 'Here we identify 123 CDK family members from animals, plants, yeasts, and four protists from which genome sequences have been completed, and 10 additional CDKs from incomplete genome sequences of organisms with known CTD sequences. Comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses suggest that cell-cycle CDKs are present in all organisms sampled in this study. In contrast, no clear orthologs of transcription-related CDKs are identified in the most putatively ancestral eukaryotes, Trypanosoma or Giardia. Kinases involved in CTD phosphorylation, CDK7, CDK8 and CDK9, all are recovered as well-supported and distinct orthologous families, but their relationships to each other and other CDKs are not well-resolved. Significantly, clear orthologs of CDK7 and CDK8 are restricted to only those organisms belonging to groups in which the RNAP II CTD is strongly conserved.\nAnswer: The apparent origins of CDK7 and CDK8, or at least their conservation as clearly recognizable orthologous families, correlate with strong stabilizing selection on RNAP II CTD structure. This suggests co-evolution of the CTD and these CTD-directed CDKs. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that CDK7 and CDK8 originated at about the same time that the CTD was canalized as the staging platform RNAP II transcription. Alternatively, extensive CTD phosphorylation may occur in only a subset of eukaryotes and, when present, this interaction results in greater stabilizing selection on both CTD and CDK sequences. Overall, our results suggest that transcription-related kinases originated after cell-cycle related CDKs, and became more evolutionarily and functionally diverse as transcriptional complexity increased.", "output": "Do comparative genomics of cyclin-dependent kinases suggest co-evolution of the RNAP II C-terminal domain and CTD-directed CDKs?", "category": "Question Generation 1469.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a passage with a context and an answer, construct a question on the basis of the information present in the passage.

Urine from patients with interstitial cystitis has been shown to inhibit urothelial proliferation through a putative antiproliferative factor and to contain decreased levels of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) compared to controls. Stretch of detrusor smooth muscle cells is known to stimulate HB-EGF production.

None of the investigated energy parameters correlated with the protective effects. Instead, inflammatory responses were dampened in one-day-fasted mice and in starved macrophages.

Inhibition of autophagy re-elevated circulating HMGB1 and abolished protection in fasted mice, as did supplementation with HMGB1. In vitro, Sirt1 inhibition prevented HMGB1 translocation, leading to elevated HMGB1 in the supernatant. In vivo, Sirt1 inhibition abrogated the fasting-induced protection, but had no effect in the presence of neutralizing HMGB1 antibody.\nAnswer: Fasting for one day protects from hepatic IR injury via Sirt1-dependent downregulation of circulating HMGB1.

Resveratrol (RSV) is able to prevent pathogenesis and/or decelerate the progression of a variety of diseases. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have also shown a protective effect of RSV on fat accumulation induced by FAs. Additionally, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has recently been linked to cellular adipogenic responses. To address the hypothesis that the RSV effect on excessive fat accumulation promoted by elevated saturated FAs could be partially mediated by a reduction of ER stress, we studied the RSV action on experimentally induced ER stress using palmitate in several cancer cell lines.', 'We show that, unexpectedly, RSV promotes an amplification of palmitate toxicity and cell death and that this mechanism is likely due to a perturbation of palmitate accumulation in the triglyceride form and to a less important membrane fluidity variation. Additionally, RSV decreases radical oxygen species (ROS) generation in palmitate-treated cells but leads to enhanced X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1) splicing and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) expression. These molecular effects are induced simultaneously to caspase-3 cleavage, suggesting that RSV promotes palmitate lipoapoptosis primarily through an ER stress-dependent mechanism. Moreover, the lipotoxicity reversion induced by eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or by a liver X receptor (LXR) agonist reinforces the hypothesis that RSV-mediated inhibition of palmitate channeling into triglyceride pools could be a key factor in the aggravation of palmitate-induced cytotoxicity.\nAnswer: Our results suggest that RSV exerts its cytotoxic role in cancer cells exposed to a saturated FA context primarily by triglyceride accumulation inhibition, probably leading to an intracellular palmitate accumulation that triggers a lipid-mediated cell death.
