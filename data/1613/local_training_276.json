However, neither the extent to which synovitis contributes to the cartilage breakdown in OA nor the effects of chronic administration of NSAIDs on the natural history of OA in humans is known. Recent studies indicate that several NSAIDs, including salicylates, suppress proteoglycan synthesis in articular cartilage in vitro. The effect on OA cartilage is more marked than that on normal cartilage. Other studies show that salicylate feeding may suppress proteoglycan metabolism in degenerating cartilage in vivo, aggravating the decrease in proteoglycan content caused by the disease itself. However, no effect of salicylates on normal articular cartilage has been observed in vivo. In damaged cartilage the magnitude of NSAID-induced suppression of proteoglycan metabolism appears to be related inversely to the proteoglycan content of the tissue. In addition, the NSAIDs used in treatment of arthritis today may differ with respect to their in vivo effects on articular cartilage metabolism due, in part, to differences between the molar concentrations of these drugs in synovial fluid.", "output": "Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in treatment of osteoarthritis.", "category": "Title Generation 1246.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper.", "input": "Abstract: To calibrate an anesthetic mass spectrometer without the use of premixed gases and vapors in cylinders, we devised a gas mixer using fixed resistances of capillary needle tubings and adjustable needle valves to dilute test gases and vapors with oxygen.

Sixty patients had atriopulmonary connection and 24 patients had atrioventricular connections. Preoperative characteristics of the two patient groups were similar, but there was a greater frequency of Waterston shunts in the atriopulmonary group (38% versus 17%) and greater frequency of Glenn shunts in the atrioventricular group (46% versus 15%). Mean pulmonary arteriolar resistance was 1.9 +/- 0.7 units in the atriopulmonary group and 1.1 +/- 0.8 units in the atrioventricular group (p less than 0.01). Early postoperatively, mean right atrial pressure was slightly higher in the atriopulmonary group than in the atrioventricular group (18 +/- 3 versus 16 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.01), but this difference was not reflected in the early or late results.

Tethered cord syndrome occurs when the elongated spinal cord is anchored by a thick filum terminale or other pathological structures. The underlying mechanism is impairment of oxidative metabolism in the lumbosacral cord. The authors studied the extensibility of various parts of lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal segments in experimental animals and correlated this with the oxidative metabolism in these segments. The filum terminale possesses far greater extensibility than any spinal cord segments and functions as a buffer in preventing the cord from overstretching. The lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal segments elongate under traction only below the attachment of the lowest pair of dentate ligaments. The lower the cord segment, the greater the percentage of elongation in spite of limited elasticity of the cord tissue; this greater percentage of elongation of the spinal cord correlates with increasing impairment of the oxidative metabolism and more severe neurological deficit. These findings explain such symptoms and signs as motor and sensory deficits in the legs associated with the human tethered cord syndrome, and correspond with the high clinical incidence of incontinence. The lower spinal cord segments elongated promptly within 3 seconds after the start of traction. This implies that repeated acute hyperextension and hyperflexion, as occurs in humans, may accentuate oxidative metabolic changes that have already been caused by chronic cord tethering.

We recorded pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), left atrial pressure (LAP), and SVP in chronic unanesthetized sheep. Occlusion balloons were placed in the left atrium and superior vena cava to control their respective pressures.

From the records obtained it is possible to determine that, early in contraction, shortening is brought about by relatively rapidly cycling [0.35 optimal muscle length units +/- 0.033/s (SE)] cross bridges. We also report that in the sensitized TSM it is the early bridges that increase their velocity by 26.6% (P less than 0.05) compared with similar bridges in muscles from control animals. Since 70% of the maximum shortening of the muscle occurs when early bridges are operative, it is likely that these bridges are responsible for the major part of the shortening.

Flow cytometry (FCM) and cytology were concordant in 57 of 103 examinations; both FCM and cytology were positive in 38 instances, and carcinoma was confirmed by biopsy in 35 (92.1%). In 16 instances FCM and cytology were negative, but carcinoma was present on biopsy in 5 (31.3%). Three examinations were suspicious by both techniques. The 46 determinations with discordant FCM and cytology were subdivided into pathologically confirmed recurrences (25 instances) and no evidence of pathologic and/or cystoscopic disease (21 instances). In the 25 instances of recurrences, FCM was positive in 18 (72.0%), suspicious in 3 (12.0%), and negative in 4 (16.0%), while cytology was positive in 3 (12.0%), suspicious in 9 (36.0%), and negative in 13 (52.0%). Most patients had a severe BCG-induced inflammatory response that caused an elevation of the hyperdiploid population, believed secondary to epithelial regeneration and proliferation. In the 21 instances without detectable recurrence, hyperploidy led to a relatively high proportion of positive (15) and suspicious (4) results by FCM, but only eight had distinct aneuploid populations. It is possible that this latter group, at least, is harboring occult carcinoma. Conventional cytology in the nonrecurrent group was positive in 1 (4.8%), suspicious in 7 (33.3%), and negative in 13 (61.9%). In those instances when tumor was confirmed by biopsy, the false-negative rate for FCM was 19.7%; the false-negative rate for cytology was 40.9%. Thus, FCM appears to be more sensitive but less specific than conventional cytology, having a lower false-negative but a higher false-positive rate. Although serial FCM provides an objective quantitative measure of aneuploid stemlines and hyperdiploid populations in bladder irrigation specimens and can be helpful in following intravesical BCG therapy for superficial bladder carcinoma, it should still be used with conventional cytology. The greatest difficulty with FCM at present, as with conventional cytology, is in cases of marked inflammation.

In parallel experiments, High Salt-detergent buffer was also found to release cross-linked CR1 from neutrophils. Second, depolymerization of F-actin by DNAse I released half of the cytoskeletal-associated cross-linked CR1. Third, immunoadsorbed neutrophil CR1, but not MHC Class I or erythrocyte CR1, specifically bound soluble 125I-actin.

Responses of rat trachea to immunologic stimulation are shown to be dependent on the presence of the epithelium, which prolongs the relaxation stage without affecting the contractions. This prolongation is abolished by neonatal capsaicin pretreatment, whereas substance P induces a significantly greater relaxation of serotonin-precontracted intact than deepithelialized trachea. Serotonin concentration-response curves are shifted to the right in intact preparations, which is partly reversed by neonatal capsaicin pretreatment, but a hyporeactivity of the tissue exists. A relaxing factor released by the epithelium is hypothesized, possibly dependent on substance P-ergic innervation. Muscarinic cholinergic innervation slightly modulates the contractions but not the relaxations in antigen-induced responses, independently on the presence of the epithelial layer. 4-Aminopyridine induces epithelium-dependent potentiations of contractions to antigen and to serotonin, which involves acetylcholine at one step of the reaction cascade.

Immunoprecipitation of surface iodinated Meth-A cell extract with HepSS-1, as well as Sepharose 4B gel chromatography of Meth-A cell extract and detection of antigens recognized by HepSS-1 by a sandwich-type radioimmunoassay revealed that the HepSS-1 antigens were composed of several molecular species, with one as large as approximately 10(6) daltons. The following evidence indicates that HepSS-1 specifically recognizes an epitope present in heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (HS-GAG). First, treatment of Meth-A cells with heparitinase or heparinase, but not with chondroitinase ABC or hyaluronidase, resulted in the loss of HepSS-1 binding. Second, HS-GAG but not seven other types of GAG (hyaluronic acid, heparin, chondroitin, chondroitin 4-sulfate, chondroitin 6-sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and keratan sulfate) inhibited HepSS-1 binding to Meth-A cells. Third, HepSS-1 bound with HS-GAG but not with the seven other types of GAG.

The results of this study demonstrate that postsurgical suppression of NKCC begins as early as 2 hr after murine hind limb amputation, reaches nadir at 4 days, and does not recover to control level until postoperative day 12. Anesthetic treatment alone does not cause comparable NKCC suppression. The suppression of NKCC accompanied changes in both splenic size and morphology. The immune suppression was observed in multiple compartments including peripheral blood, bone marrow, and spleen. Mixing experiments demonstrated that surgical stress per se generated a suppressor cell population affecting NKCC. The observed suppression apparently required cell-to-cell contact, because supernatants from 4 and 18 hr cultures of suppressor cells did not cause suppression. The observed suppression was prevented by perioperative treatment with the pyrimidinone analog 2-amino-5-bromo-6-phenyl-4-pyrimidinol.

By using these methods, we clarified that the function of the HLA-DR molecule in the CPAg-driven IgE response is similar to that of I-A or I-E molecule in mice, namely the product of immune response genes (Ir-genes), because anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody blocked the response, and the interaction between monocyte and monocyte-depleted peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) to respond to CPAg was restricted by HLA-DR. Furthermore, PBL from nonresponders revealed a specific IgE response to CPAg when the Leu-2+3- T cell fraction was depleted, thereby suggesting that even nonresponders have Leu-2-3+ T cell and B cell clones specific for CPAg, and they apparently show no response due to the presence of CPAg-specific Leu-2+3- suppressor T cells. This suppressor T cell fraction abolished the IgE response of the autologous B + monocyte + Leu-2-3+ T cell in a CPAg-specific manner. The current cellular analysis together with our previous genetic analysis strongly suggest that the HLA-linked IgE nonresponse to CPAg is mediated by CPAg-specific suppressor T cells.

In ten normal subjects, furosemide resulted in a fall in urine pH below 5.5 and an increase in net acid and K+ excretion.

In 13 patients with DRTA, defined by failure to lower urine pH below 5.5 during acidemia, three distinctive responses to furosemide were found. In six patients with the hyperkalemic variety, furosemide failed to lower urine pH below 5.5 and resulted in a blunted increase in K+ excretion, thereby suggesting that a normal transtubular voltage in the CCT could not be generated in such patients. In five patients with classic RTA, furosemide failed to lower urine pH below 5.5, but K+ excretion increased normally.

Further analysis shows that multimodal treatment with surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy, especially in patients older than 1 year of age with Stage II disease, has influenced the survival significantly. The fact that age at diagnosis and the administration of chemotherapy have independent prognostic significance can be explained by the theory that all neuroblastomas are virtually congenital; therefore, the difference in age at diagnosis largely reflects the difference in growth rates of the tumor. Thus, according to this theory, age may be a measure of the probability of micrometastases in addition to the clinical extent or stage of the disease, as it represents the duration of the disease. Additional chemotherapy may thus have eradicated these micrometastases in the older children, since the age influence on Stage II disease disappeared when multimodal treatment was given in this study.

Although these recombinants were reciprocal in haplotype orientation to the three recombinants we reported recently, these too crossed over within the same 7 kb stretch of DNA in the E beta gene. This 7 kb stretch of DNA included the 3' half of the first intron, the beta 1 exon, the second intron, and the beta 2 exon. A comparison of the cDNA sequences of the two parental E beta alleles revealed that although the beta 2 exons were identical, there were several nucleotide differences between the two beta 1 exons. This allowed us to determine the parental origin of the beta 1 exon in the recombinants at the level of transcription by using S1 nuclease mapping. Thus we were able to show that in each case the 3' portion of the first intron and the beta 1 exon were upstream from the site of crossover. All eight recombinants involving the k and s haplotypes now can be mapped within a 4.5 kb stretch of DNA, which includes only the beta 1-beta 2 intron and the beta 2 exon of the E beta gene.

In this study we have confirmed at the genotype level that LRC-L119 is L. major by analyzing and comparing the organization of cloned DNA sequences in the genome of different strains of L. major. Here we show that LRC-L119 promastigotes are phagocytosed rapidly by macrophages in vitro, but in contrast to virulent strains of L. major, they are then killed over a period of 18 hr.
