For those people, her life and her success are a good example. She has struggled with many of the challenges that we all face, and she has changed her life. Her message is powerful: I did it, and so can you. Oprah Winfrey is a black woman whose becoming famous is an encouraging story. She was born on January 29, 1954 in a small village in America. Her patents were very poor. For her family, life seemed to hold no promise. But there was nothing that could stop Oprah. She was an extremely bright girl at school. She asked her kindergarten teacher to let her go to school sooner and she also skipped  the second grade of primary school . Her life from the age of six till about fourteen was very hard. For many women such difficulty would be too heavy to bear . But not for Oprah. When she was fourteen, Oprah went to live with her father. Her father showed her how hard work and discipline  could lead to self-improvement. Oprah listened to her father, and a few years later she won a college scholarship that allowed her to go to university. Two years later, after graduation, she started working for television. For more than ten years she worked for different TV stations across the country. In 1984, she moved to Chicago, where she became the host of a talk show called \"AM Chicago\". When Oprah started, \"AM Chicago\" had few listeners. By September of the next year, the show was so successful that it was given a new name: 'The Oprah Winfrey Show\". Oprah Winfrey's story encourages many people to believe that success and happiness in life are within reach for everyone. \n Answer: I managed to over come  the challenges.", "output": "What does Oprah Winfrey mean by saying \"I did it\"?", "category": "Question Generation 939.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article and an answer.

A fingerprint scanning system, approved this month for testing at the Desert Sands district, northeast of San Diego. Students will be scanned as they get on and off the bus. \"Kids get lost. It happens in every school district, every year,\" says John DeVries, president of Global Biometrics Security, which developed the Biometric Observation Security System (BOSS) that's being tested. It happened Oct. 13 when a Prince George's County (Md.) school employee took a 5-year-old student to the wrong bus and the student got off several blocks from home.  With BOSS, students' fingerprints are scanned and sent to a database. When they get off, they provide a \"check out\" print. An alarm sounds if the child tries to get off at the wrong place. The fingerprints are not stored, DeVries says. They are converted into a series of numbers that cannot be used to re-create the print, he says. Margaret Gomez of Palm Springs, Calif., whose daughter, then 6, was let off a bus about a mile from her home three years ago, supports the idea. \"Anything is better than what they have in place now.\"  Other tracking systems include the ZPass from Seattle-based Zonar Systems, which uses a programmed card carried by students or tied to a backpack. It is in about 30 districts, including North Kansas City Schools and Illinois School District 128 in Palos Heights, company executive Chris Oliver says.

The world is very different now, for man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life. And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forbears fought are still at issue around the globe, the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of God. We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution. Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe (enemy) alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage and unwilling to disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage and unwilling to disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around the world. Let every nation know whether it wishes us well or ill that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the survival and the success of liberty.

Movies, television and video games are full of gunplay and bloodshed, and one might reasonably ask what's wrong with a society that presents videos of violence as entertainment. Viewing large amounts of violent television and video games may well contribute to violent behavior in certain individuals. The trouble comes when researchers downplay uncertainties in their studies or overstate the case for causality . Skeptics were dismayed several years ago when a group of societies including the American Medical Association tried to end the debate by issuing a joint statement: \"At this time, well over 1,000 studies... point to a causal connection between media violence and aggressive behavior in some children.\" Freedom-of-speech advocates accused the societies of catering to politicians, and even disputed the number of studies (most were review articles and essays, they said). When Jonathan Freedman, a social psychologist at the University of Toronto, reviewed the literature, he found only 200 or so studies of television-watching and aggression. And when he weeded out \"the most doubtful measures of aggression\", only 28% supported a connection. The critical point here is causality. The alarmists say they have proved that violent media cause aggression. But the assumptions behind their observations need to be examined. When labeling games as violent or non-violent, should a hero eating a ghost really be counted as a violent event? And when experimenters record the time it takes game players to read \"aggressive\" or \"non-aggressive\" words from a list, can we be sure what they are actually measuring? The intention of the new Harvard Center on Media and Child Health to collect and standardize studies of media violence in order to compare their methodologies, assumptions and conclusions is an important step in the right direction. Another appropriate step would be to tone down the criticism until we know more. Several researchers write, speak and testify quite a lot on the threat posed by violence in the media. That is, of course, their privilege. But when doing so, they often come out with statements that the matter has now been settled, drawing criticism from colleagues. In response, the alarmists accuse critics and news reporters of being deceived by the entertainment industry.

To make the most of this advantage, India's children need to be educated. On paper, India is doing well here. The country has a nationwide network of state primary schools funded by a specially designed tax. 96% of children aged 6-14 go to school, even in rural areas. That's well above the average for the developing world and their attendance is good. But the attainment is poor: three quarters of third graders can't read a gradeone text and 53% of grade five kids can't read at the standard they should have achieved at grade two. Levels of achievement are almost as bad in math.  \"The main problem in India is not school entry or whether there is a local school; it's the delivery of education, the way teaching is done or not done,\" says Vinati Sukhdev, the executive director of Pratham, a charity that campaigns for better education in India. And according to Ms. Sukhdev, the country's teachers are the thirdbestpaid in the world but they're poorly trained and are often absent. Teacher attendance at the primary level is only 85%, according to Pratham's research and there's little punishment for those who don't turn up.  The government knows that state schooling needs to improve. In 2009 it passed the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act (RTE), a law for the national provision of free, childfriendly education. It says that there should be two teachers for every 60 students and that they should go to work regularly, get there on time, follow the curriculum, assess how well the children are learning and meet regularly with parents.  \"What we need to do next is improve accountability ,\" says Ms. Sukhdev. Schools have management committees that are supposed to include parent and local government representatives. \"But they don't work or people don't know they exist.\" Pratham tries to help local communities and parents drive improvement. \"You should see the kind of reaction we get when they realize the teacher is paid but isn't turning up!\"says Ms.  Sukhdev. \"We can't be everywhere, so we limit ourselves to working in a few districts, where we can create model schools. Then we try to work together with local government to make sure every school in the district or state is raised to that level.\" The Read India programme is an example of what targeted help can achieve. Pratham has created an easytouse teaching and assessment pack called Learn to Read. It has trained teachers in how to use the pack at school and showed community health workers, volunteers and parents how it could support learning outside school. The programme has now run across 19 states, involving 450,000 volunteers and training 600,000 teachers and government workers.

No one disagree with the powerful effect music has on individuals. Whether this effect is positive or negative, however, often depends on the type of music listened to. And researches have shown that certain types of music own the ability to relieve one's anxiety, improve brain development in children, uplift one's memory and help patients to recover...just to name a few.      It should come as no surprise then, that researchers from the Tufts University have found that background music has the ability to directly affect one's eating habits as well. They counted the bites of food individuals took at meals while listening to different types of music. The diners \"ate at an average  rate of 3.9 bites per minute\", with about a third of the diners requesting more food after clearing their plates. On the other hand, with \"spirited tunes, \"the diners \"sped up to an average of 5.1 bites per minute! \"Not surprising however, when \"calming flute instrumental\" were played, the eating speed of the diners slowed \"to 3.2 bites per minute--and the bites became smaller\". They didn't request second helpings and praised that the food tasted better.    Studies have clearly stated that one safe way of losing weight includes eating slowly. Since it takes about 20 minutes for your stomach to tell the brain that it's full, eating slowly will help you to eat to satisfaction--without overdoing it. With this important piece of information then, it leads one to believe that with the use of calming background instrumental music, one can slow their food digestion, \"retraining\" both the stomach and the brain to take in less food which could lead to weight lost.        Is there any truth to this theory? One will never know unless they try it themselves.

An X-ray of a painting is one of the best ways to tell if it was created by a famous painter or if it is a forgery .If there is a question as to whether an old master has painted a certain painting or not, X-rays are made and compared to those of paintings that are known to be original.If the brushstrokes   , for example, are shown to be totally different than in other work done by a certain artist, then the painting is proved to be a fake copy. Since modern paints are usually made from different materials than paints of hundreds of years ago, the image they leave on an X-ray film looks different.This is another way X-rays can be used to spot a forgery.A modem artist will try to make a forgery look hundreds of years old by painting dirty varnish on it or by using artificial means to get the varnish to look cracked.To the naked eye the forgery may look old, but when a careful study of the X-ray image is made, the _ is obvious.

The driver returned the next spring to see what had become of his cargo. Instead of the skeletons he had expected to find, he saw his oxen, living, fat, and healthy. How had they survived?     The answer lay in a resource that unknowing Americans had trampled   underfoot in their haste to cross the \"Great American Desert\" to reach lands that sometimes proved barren. In the eastern parts of the United States, the preferred grass for forage   was a cultivated plant. It grew well with enough rain, then when cut and stored it would cure and become nourishing hay for winter feed. But in the dry grazing lands of the west, that familiar blue joint grass was often killed by drought. To raise cattle out there seemed risky or even hopeless.      Who could imagine a fairy-tale grass that required no rain and somehow made it possible for cattle to feed themselves all winter? But the surprising western wild grasses did just that. They had wonderfully convenient features that made them superior to the cultivated eastern grasses. Variously known as buffalo grass, not only were they immune to drought, but they were actually preserved by the lack of summer and autumn rains. They were not juicy like the cultivated eastern grasses, but had short, hard stems. And they did not need to be cured in a barn, but dried right where they grew on the ground. When they dried in this way, they remained naturally sweet and nourishing through the winter. Cattle left outdoors to fend for themselves thrived on this hay. And the cattle themselves helped plant the fresh grass year after year, for they trampled the natural seeds firmly into the soil to be watered by the melting snows of winter and the occasional rains of spring.

Here are some of the good habits you can develop when it comes to healthy eating. Drink plenty of water. You must drink at least 8 glasses of water a day. You may need even more water if you are in a hot environment or if you are exercising. Eat breakfast. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. A recent study has shown that those who eat breakfast will consume an average of 100 calories less during the day than their colleagues who skipped breakfast. They will also be able to concentrate better. Don't skip lunch. If you do so, your blood sugar level will drop and your metabolism   will slow down. When you get home you are starving and eat everything you can find. We all need to snack from time to time, but please choose your snacks carefully. In fact, it's a good idea to eat two healthy snacks besides your three main meals. Choose healthy snacks like fruits and vegetables, low fat yogurt, cottage cheese with apple sauce, and so on. Eat your fruit and vegetables. We should eat at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables a day. Take a piece of fruit for a snack, add some banana and _ to your favourite breakfast cereal, have a salad with lunch, and eat at least one vegetable at dinner each night. Do not eat your dinner too late. Try to eat dinner at least 3 hours before you go to bed. This will give your body a chance to digest most of the food before you rest for the next 8 hours. Plan dinner for the week ahead of time and make sure you have everything you need in the house so other family members can get a head start on dinner if you have a late meeting at the office. \n Answer: 5.", "output": "How many good eating habits are mentioned in the passage?", "category": "Question Generation 939.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article and an answer.

He spent most of his childhood with his grandmother inLawrence,Kansas. She told him stories about their family and their fight to end slavery. Her storytelling filled him with pride in himself and his race. He first began to write poetry when he was living with her. In 1919, he moved to Cleveland,Ohio, to stay with his mother. He attended Central High School inCleveland. Langston was named Class Poet one year. He published his first short stories while still in high school. Langston Hughes struggled with a feeling of loneliness caused by his parents' divorce. He developed a love for reading books as a way to deal with the lack of time his parents spent with him. His love for reading grew into a desire to write. He wanted to reproduce the powerful effect other writers, like Walt Whitman, had made upon him. After graduating from high school in 1920, Langston moved to Mexico Cityto live with his father for one year. His father did not offer much warmth to him. Yet, Langston turned the pain caused by his family problems into one of his most famous poems,\" The Negro Speaks of Rivers.\" In this poem, he speaks of the strength and pride of black people in ancient African civilizations and inAmerica. Langston arrived in New Yorkat 19. Later, he left school, broke with his father, and began traveling. Traveling was a lifelong love that would take him throughout the world before he died. In 1922, Hughes took a job on a ship and sailed to Africa. He wrote poems and short stories during his travels. His experiences while traveling greatly influenced his work. He sent a few of his writings back home. They were published, and readers found a totally new and fresh style in his poems. \n Answer: His grandma's storytelling", "output": "What was the main reason for Langston's first attempt at writing poems?", "category": "Question Generation 939.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article and an answer.

It was at this time that Paul invited me to his house for a \"chill out ( ).\" Although tired, I was all excited to chat up with Paul and share and learn through his rich experience in marketing. As we entered through the main door to his house, Paul started singing a song : I have a dream, to help me through in everything...and so on.

Studies have shown. for instance. that eating in front of the TV (or a similar distraction) can increase both hunger and the amount of food consumed. Even simple visual cues( ). like plate size and lighting, have been shown to affect portion size and consumption.       A new study suggested that our shot-term memory also may play a role in appetite.  Several hours after a meal, people's hunger levels were predicted not by how much they'd eaten but rather by how much food they'd seen in front of them --- in other words, how much they remembered eating.       This difference suggests the memory of our previous meal may have a bigger influence on our appetite than the actual size of the meal. says Jeffrey M . Brunstrom , a professor of experimental psychology at the University of Bristol.     \"Hunger isn't. controlled solely by the physical characteristics of a recent meal. We have identified an independent role for memory for that meal.\" Brunstrom says. \"This shows that the relationship between hunger and food intake is more complex than we thought.\"      These findings echo earlier research that suggests our perception of food can sometimes trick our body's response to the food itself. In a 2011 study, for instance, people who drank the same 380-calorie milkshake on two separate occasions produced different levels of hunger-related hormones, depending on whether the shake's label said it contained 620 0r 140 calories. Moreover, the participants reported feeling more full when they thought they'd consumed a higher-calorie shake.      What does this means for our eating habits? Although it hardly seems practical to trick ourselves in to eating less, the new findings do highlight the benefits of focusing on our food avoiding TV and multitasking while eating.      The so-called mindful-eating strategies can fight distractions and help us control our appetite, Brunstrom says. \n Answer: How we perceive the food we eat.", "output": "What is said to be a factor affecting our appetite and food intake?", "category": "Question Generation 939.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article and an answer.

All but two pieces sold, fetching more than PS70m, a record for a sale by a single artist. It was a last victory. As the auctioneer called out bids, in New York one of the oldest banks on Wall Street, Lehman Brothers, filed for bankruptcy, starting the most severe financial crisis since the 1920s. The world art market had already been losing momentum  for a while after rising confusingly since 2003. At its peak in 2007 it was worth some $65 billion, thinks Clare McAndrew, founder of Arts Economics, a research firm -- double the figure five years earlier. Since then it may have come down to $50 billion. But the market generates interest far beyond its size because it brings together great wealth, enormous egos , greed, passion and controversy in a way matched by few other industries. In the weeks and months that followed Mr. Hirst's sale, spending of any sort became deeply unfashionable. In the art world that meant collectors stayed away from galleries and salerooms. Sales of contemporary art fell by two-thirds, and in the most overheated sector, they were down by nearly 90% in the year to November 2008. Within weeks the world's two biggest auction houses, Sotheby's and Christie's, had to pay out nearly $200m in guarantees to clients who had placed works for sale with them. The current downturn in the art market is the worst since the Japanese stopped buying Impressionists at the end of 1989. This time experts suppose that prices are about 40% down on their peak on average, though some have been far more volatile  . But Edward Dolman, Christie's chief executive, says, \"I'm pretty confident we're at the bottom.\" What makes this fall different from the last, he says, is that there are still buyers in the market, while in the early 1990s, when interest rates were high, there was no demand even though many collectors wanted to sell. Christie's earnings in the first half of 2009 were still higher than in the first half of 2006. Almost everyone who was interviewed for this special report said that the biggest problem at the moment is not a lack of demand but a lack of good work to sell. The three Ds -- death, debt and divorce -- still deliver works of art to the market.

The best speeches often take on a combination of all three of these components . However, before you can go about the writing of a great speech, it is important to set goals. Goals keep you,your speech and your audience focused. What a goal is In the context of a speech, a goal is the purpose of the speech, and what it hopes to accomplish. For example, the goal of a eulogy  might be to celebrate the life of a loved one. The goal of a speech at a political gathering would be to inform the crowd about the political position of a candidate and persuade them to vote and campaign for the candidatein question . Why a goal is important Without a goal, a speech is without direction. The goal informs the structure and content of the speech. For example, if a speech's goal is to convince people that smoking is bad for them, the speech will be structured with persuasive arguments to back up the goal. A speech with a goal of informing the audience will keep the information fair and factual. A goal is incredibly important to the speech's ability to connect with an audience. If the speaker is unaware of the goal of the speech, the audience will likely be unaware as well. This severely reduces the effectiveness of the message. Aside from informing the audience of the content and structure, a speech's goal drives the speaker to greater heights. If a speaker is asked to speak on a specific subject, but never establishes the goal, they won't know where to start in the research, organizing and writing of the speech.  _  If you have been charged with  delivering a speech, establishing a goal can seem difficult at first. There are several things to take into consideration. First, think about who you will be speaking to. The demographic  of your audience will likely determine whether you will be able to persuade them, or whether they will be able to sit through(......). Second, think about the topic itself. If the topic is something controversial , it may worth your while to consider an informative approach to present both sides of the issue. Finally, consider your resources.

Large numbers of 16- to 18-year-olds are going to study subjects such as agriculture, food and gamekeeping despite having no background in farming. Jeanette Dawson, principal of Bishop Burton College, said women were also taking up courses at an increasing rate. She said it was related to a series of food scandals  such as the discovery of horsemeat in frozen meals stocked by major supermarkets. But the movement was also promoted by an increased awareness of the importance of local food and produce, she said. The number of students taking courses in \"land-based subjects\" has increased by a quarter in the last 12 months alone - from 5,138 to 6,482. Mrs. Dawson said there were a lot of young people who weren't from farming backgrounds. But there had been a growth in the number of them accessing agriculture programes with a view to a career in the industry.

Beatrix was born into a rich London-based family where she was tutored by very strict private teachers and so spent her youth isolated from other youngsters. During her youth she had a lot of pets and spent vacations in Scotland and also the Lake District. It was at the Lake District that she developed a love of wildlife. She studied the area's natural wonders carefully and painted them continuously. But her old-fashioned, Manchester-born parents discouraged her intellectual improvement, thinking it inappropriate for a young lady. However, her study and watercolour paintings of wild mushrooms made her widely respected within the field of biology. In her 30's, Beatrix Potter wrote the remarkably successful kid's book, The Tale of Pew Rabbit. Close to that time she became secretly engaged to her publisher Norman Warne. This caused a great disagreement with her parents, who did not approve of Beatrix getting married to somebody of lower social status. Sadly, Warne died before the marriage ceremony. Ultimately Beatrix Potter began writing and also illustrating   kid's books full-time. Using profits from her books, Beatrix grew to become economically independent of her parents and was eventually in a position to buy Hill Top Farm in the Lake District. She extended the property with additional purchases of neighbouring land over time. In her 40's, Bestrix married William Heelis, a local lawyer. She ended up becoming a sheep breeder and farmer while continuing to publish as well as illustrate books for children. In all she authored 23 publications. Beatrix died on December 22, 1943, and left the majority of her property to the National Trust. Her books carry on selling well globally, in many different languages. Her stories have been retold in numerous formats including a ballet, movies, and cartoons.

But after seven months he was bored. Soon after that, Forbes moved to London. He took four different jobs at three companies over the next five years. Forbes wanted a better job and higher pay---he was never quite satisfied. Welcome to the world of a job hopper. Forbes's story isn't unusual these days and such frequent movement from one job to the next will become more common. The main reason: the nature of employment is changing. There are a lot more contracts and part-time jobs or flexible employment. That leads to people having a greater number of jobs. What's more, layoffs  and pay freezes , among other things, have pushed people from one job to another. In some cases, a bad worldwide job market has limited opportunities for star employees, promoting them to seek new challenges at other companies. However, employers often think that if a person jumped from his last employer after a short period, he will likely do the same again --- there is a significant financial risk in hiring someone who leaves in short order. What's more, moving from company to company frequently doesn't mean workers are climbing the corporate ladder  faster. In 2005, Monika Hamori, a professor at Spain's IE Business School, looked at CEOs at about 55 to see if those who moved around more frequently climbed the ladder faster. She found that executives who stayed with one company became CEOs after 23 years, while executives who changed companies many times became CEOs after 26 years. One reason: workers within the same organization tend to be promoted more frequently and be offered better jobs. \n Answer: It was dangerous.", "output": "How did Forbes feel about his first job at first?", "category": "Question Generation 939.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article and an answer.

Dinosaur Farm Museum was established in 1993. Since then, the museum has introduced the study of old bones to many more people. What we offer Visitors can enjoy our displays, or watch us cleaning dinosaur bones and other fossils found on the island's beaches. The museum has a variety of different fossils, many of them never displayed to the public before. As more are discovered all the time, you can be sure of seeing something new each time you visit. We have a free Fossil Identification Service, so you can bring in any fossils you have and find out what they are. In addition, we have a reasonably-priced Museum Shop, where you can buy a souvenir of your visit. You could also bring a picnic and relax in our special picnic area. Activities Fossil hunts are organized from the museum and run all year round. Groups of up to 25 are guided on a local beach where they can search for fossils. All these hunts are fully licensed and insured, and guides can help to identify any fossils found and point out things of interest. Due to the popularity of these hunts, all trips must be booked by a personal visit to Dinosaur Farm Museum. Did you know...? The BBC programme \"Live from Dinosaur Island\" was filmed along the coast here, and Dinosaur Farm Museum was the base for the television crew.

You can buy these right away.     If the item is being auctioned,you offer the highest price you are prepared to pay and eBay bids for you. The bid will be increased little by little until it goes beyond your highest bid,then you are emailed and asked if you would like to bid again. Auctions last up to 10 days and when they finish you get an email telling you whether you have won the item.     How to pay: Sellers decide how they would like to be paid and you need to check this before placing a bid as you might not want to post a cheque or postal orders. The easiest way is through PayPal,an online payment system that takes the money away from your credit card  .

There's a new type of business franchise that is appearing in shopping malls and neighborhood across America offering pay-per-use  indoor playgrounds, which feature toys, games, guided fun and a workout that doesn't break the family bank. As public playgrounds grow increasingly worn and dirty, the for-profit centers offer clean, safe guided activity as well as a variety of challenging exercises to develop kids' physical fitness, usually for a fee of around $ 5 an hour. \"Playgrounds are dirty, not guided,\" says Dick Guggenheimer, owner of the two-month-old Discovery Zone in Yonkers, N.

Your task is to generate the question for the answer based on the given article.", "input": "Article: Climatic conditions are delicately adjusted to composition of the Earth's atmosphere. If there were a change in the atmosphere -- for example, in the   amounts of atmospheric gases -- the climate would probably change also. A slight increase in water vapor   , for example, would increase the heat-keeping capacity of the atmosphere and would lead to a rise in global temperatures. The level of carbon dioxide, CO2, in the atmosphere has an important effect on climatic change. Most of the Earth's incoming energy is short-wavelength radiation   , which tends to pass through atmospheric CO2easily. The Earth, however, reradiates much of the received energy as long-wavelength radiation  , which CO2absorbs and then goes toward the Earth. This phenomenon, known as the greenhouse effect, can result in an increase in the surface temperature of a planet. An extreme example of the effect is shown by Venus, a planet covered by heavy clouds composed mostly of CO2, whose surface temperatures have been measured at 430~C.If the CO2 content of the atmosphere is reduced, the temperature falls. According to one respectable theory, if the atmospheric CO2concentration were halved, the Earth would become completely covered with ice.  Another equally respectable theory, however, states that a halving of the CO2concentration would lead only to a reduction in global temperatures of 3degC. If, because of an increase in forest fires or volcanic activity, the CO2content of the atmosphere increased, a warmer climate would be produced. Plant growth, which relied on both the warmth and the availability of CO2, would probably increase. As a consequence, plant would use more and more CO2.  Eventually CO2levels would decrease and the climate, in turn, would become cooler. With reduced temperatures many plants would die; CO2would thus be returned to the atmosphere and gradually the temperature would rise again. Thus, if this process occurred, there might be a long-term oscillation   in the amount of CO2present in the atmosphere, with regular temperature increase and decrease. Some climatologists argue that the burning of fossil fuels has raised the level of CO2in the atmosphere and has caused a global temperature increase of at least 1degC. But a supposed global temperature rise of 1 degC may in reality be only several regional temperature increases, restricted to areas where there are many meteorological   stations. Other areas, for example, the Southern Hemisphere oceanic zone, may be experiencing an equal temperature decrease that is unrecognized because of the shortage of meteorological recording stations. \n Answer: Why are there fewer meteorological recording stations in the Southern Hemisphere oceanic zone than atmosphere?", "output": "Which of the following questions does the information supplied in this passage try to answer?", "category": "Question Generation 939.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article and an answer.

Researchers from Brock University in Ontario found that those who spend more than three hours each day in front of the screen are particularly unlikely to have developed the ability to empathise .     The Canadian researchers surveyed 109 boys and girls,aged 13 and 14,about whether they played video games,which games they liked,and how long they spent playing them.Their findings found that 88 percent of teens said they played games,and more than half admitted to playing games everyday.Violent games were among the most popular.     The teenagers also filled in a questionnaire designed to measure their moral development.For example,they were asked how important it is to save the life of a friend.     Previous studies have suggested that a person's moral judgement goes through four phases as they grow from children and enter adulthood.By the age of 13 or 14,scientists claim young people should be entering the third stage,and be able to empathise with others and take their viewpoints into account.The research found that this stage appeared to be delayed in teenagers who regularly played violent video games.     It is also thought that teenagers who play games regularly did not spend enough time in the real world to learn to take other's thoughts into consideration.Researcher Mirjana Bajovic said:\"The present results indicate that some teenagers;who spent three or more hours a day playing violent video games,are deprived of such opportnnities.\"Writing in the journal Educational Media International.the researchers added:\"Touch to violence in video games may influence the development of moral reasoning because violence is not only presented as acceptable but is also justified and rewarded.\"     They concluded that rather than trying to enforce an'unrealistic'ban on the games, parents and teachers should encourage teenagers to do charity work and take up after-school activities. \n Answer: Getting teens hard to take others into consideration.", "output": "What would be the result of playing violent video games?", "category": "Question Generation 939.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article and an answer.

Anyone can take the test for free. The new exam is called the EFSET, which is short for Education First Standardized English Test. The company, Education First, is known by the letters EF. It is estimated that there are two billion English language learners worldwide. Many of them are interested in attending an American college or university. To do so, foreign students need to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language -- better known as TOEFL. However, many foreigners are not wealthy enough to take the TOEFL. In addition, test-takers often have to travel overnight to reach an official testing site. The World Bank says an average Cambodian worker earns only about $1,000 per year. Approximately the cost of taking the TOEFL is 17.5 percent of the average worker's yearly wage. It is not just individuals who find the test pricey. Some governments also find it prohibitive. What's more, not everyone needs official results from the TOEFL or IELTS -- the International English Language Testing System. In the future, it's likely that the government may use the EFSET to test millions of employees and students. Experts believe that the EFSET meets the highest value in language testing. It uses special computer software that makes the questions easier or harder, depending on one's performance. The EFSET measures all the English learners' levels while the IELTS and TOEFL only measure learners' levels from moderate   to advanced. The EFSET is unique in the sense that it gives free online access to anyone interested in measuring their English level. There is a 50-minute and a two-hour version of the test, which its developers are calling the EFSET Plus. Both versions test only reading and listening skills. It's hopeful that speaking and writing skills will be tested in the future. The IELTS and the TOEFL still use humans to rate the speaking and writing sections.

A complete DNA read - out for every newborn will be technically possible and affordable in less than five years, promising a revolution in healthcare, says Jay Flatley, the chief executive of Illumina. Only social and legal problems are likely to delay the age of \"genome sequences,\" or genetic profiles. By 2019 it will have become routine to map infants' genes when they are born, Dr Flatly told The Times. This will open a new approach to medicine, by which conditions such as high blood pressure and heart disease can be predicted and prevented and drugs used more safely and effectively. A baby's genome can be discovered at birth by a blood test. By examining a person's genome, it is possible to identify raised risks of developing diseases such as cancers. Those at high risk can then be screened more regularly, or given drugs or dietary advice to lower their chances of becoming ill.  Personal genomes could also be used to ensure that patients get the medicine that is most likely to work for them and least likely to have side-effects. The development, however, will raise legal concerns about privacy and access to individuals' genetic records. \"Bad things can be done with the genome. It could predict something about someone - and you could possibly hand the information to their employer or their insurance company.\" said Dr Flatley. \"People have to recognize that  _ , and that your genome probably can't be protected, because everywhere you go you leave your genome behind.

It ran into an oncoming vehicle, leaving the occupants trapped inside as both vehicles burst into flames. Bonge was the first on the scene and heard children screaming. He broke through a back window and pulled Mallory Smith, 10, and her sister, Megan Smith,9,from the wreckage. The girls' mother, Beckie Smith, was not with them at the time of the wreck, as they were traveling with their baby sitter, Lisa Bow bin. Beckie Smith still remembers the sickening feeling she had up on receiving the call informing her of the wreck and the despair as she drove to the scene. Bozeman and Clemmons arrived shortly after Bonge and helped rescue the other victims and attempted to put out the fires. \"I was nervous,\" Bozeman said.\" I don't feel like I'm a hero. I was just doing what anyone should do in that situation.

The moneylender, who was old and ugly, fancied the businessman's beautiful daughter. So he proposed a bargain. The moneylender told them that he would put a black pebble and a white pebble into an empty bag. The girl would then have to pick one pebble from the bag. If she picked the black pebble, she would become the moneylender's wife and he would _ her father's debt. If she picked the white pebble, she need not marry him and her father's debt would still be forgiven. But if she refused to pick a pebble, her father would be thrown into jail. They were standing on a pebble-strewn path. As they talked, the moneylender bent over to pick up two pebbles. The sharp-eyed girl noticed that he had picked up two black pebbles and put them into the bag. He then asked the girl to pick a pebble from the bag. No doubt she was caught in a dilemma. What would you have done if you were the girl? Careful analysis would produce three possibilities: 1.The girl should refuse to take a pebble. 2.The girl should know that there were two black pebbles in the bag and expose the money-lender as a cheat. 3.The girl should pick a black pebble and sacrifice herself in order to save her father from his debt and imprisonment. The above story is used with the hope that it will make us appreciate the difference between lateral  and logical thinking. Read on... The girl put her hand into the moneybag and drew out a pebble.

But there are slight differences between British and American English in vocabulary, pronunciation, spelling and grammar. The first difference between British and American English is in vocabulary. Almost all of the words used in British English and American English are exactly the same. Only a very small number of words are used _ . For example, Americans would say \"apartment\", but the British would say \"flat\" to talk about the place where they live. In addition to some common words, many idiomatic expressions are different. In England people might say \"I'll ring you up tonight\", but in the US, people might say \"I'll call you up tonight\". The second difference between British and American English is in Pronunciation. The main difference in pronunciation concerns the vowels . Some American dialects and some British dialects use vowels in different ways. Sometimes, Americans and the British don't understand each other's pronunciation. But most of the time, the British and Americans do understand each other's pronunciation because most of the sounds of the two dialects are the same. The third difference is very small. This is the difference in spelling. A few types of words are spelled differently in British and American English. The most common example is in a word like \"center\". In British English, this word would be spelled C-E-N-T-R-E, while in American English the same word would be spelled C-E-N-T-E-R. Another example is \"or\" vs \"our\". The word \"color\"is spelled C-O-L-O-U-R in Britain but C-O-L-O-R in the US. There are a few differences in grammar, too. The British may say \"Have you got..?\" while Americans prefer \"Do you have..?\" An American might say \"my friend just arrived\", but a British would say \"my friend has just arrived\".

What should our attitude to beggars be? There can be no question that the world is full of terribly sad stories. It must be terrible to have no idea where our next meal is going to come from. It seems cruel not to give some money to beggars. Certainly, most of the world's great religions order us to be open-hearted and share what we have with those less fortunate than ourselves. _ ? Maybe what was    morally right in the old days, when one knew exactly who in the village had suffered  misfortune and needed help, is no longer the best idea. Quite a few people will not give to beggars.     Let us look at their arguments. First, some believe that many city beggars dress up on purpose to look pitiable and actually make a good living from begging. Giving to beggars only encourages this sort of evil . Secondly, there is the worry that the money you give will be spent on beer, wine or drugs. Thirdly, there is the opinion that there is no real excuse for begging. One might be poor, but that is no reason for losing one's sense of pride and self-dependence. There is an opinion that the problem should be dealt with by the government rather than ordinary people. Some people think the local government department should help the beggars It is hard to come to any final conclusion: there are various cases and we must deal with them differently.

No experiment in 106 years had broken that speed limit.Physicists expect strict study to follow, which OPERA and CERN scientists welcomed. Fermilab operates a similar experiment, called MINOS, that shoots neutrinos from Illinois to an underground detector in Minnesota.In 2007, MINOS discovered a just detectable amount of faster than-light neutrinos, but the permissible difference of error was too big to \"mention\" , Plunkett said.

This month ,the Nature's 100 Best List will be revealed at the World Conservation Congress  in Barcelona ,Spain. Benyus co-authored the list of nature inspired designs with economist Gunter Pauli.
