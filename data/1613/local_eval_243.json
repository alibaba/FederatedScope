They had a clean, refreshing, decidedly strong rush of pure mint flavor. For years I enjoyed the intense, clean sweet flavor, as I bit into them. Unfortunately, Wrigleys (the new owners) have altered the flavor (more artificial ingredients?) and added blue artificial color to them. The mints now taste like cheap toothpaste, that leaves an unpleasant chemical aftertaste in your mouth. These once delightful mints are now ghastly! Let's hope the Wrigley's people with the uneducated palates don't mess with the Peppermint Altoids!  I will not buy these wintergreen mints again, unless they change back to the old style, which was full of natural mint flavor, and artifical color free.  If you are lucky enough to find a tin that does not list \"color (blue 1)\" in the ingredients list, you've found some of the old style wintergreen mints (the good ones).  The full ingredients list on the original good wintergreen altoids was (sugar, natural and artificial flavors, gum arabic, gelatin).  Since I wrote this review I've been fortunate to find about a dozen boxes of the good, old mints.  These were at small out of the way grocery/drug stores that tend to charge a little more for their products.  July, 2012: Well, it's been a year since I've been able to find a box of the good, old mints.  I broke down and bought a box of the new version today.  Wrigley's has added some of the natural flavor back to these mints, and they do taste slightly better.  However, they have left in the artificial color \"blue 1\", which negatively affects the flavor, and leaves  a bit of bitter aftertaste.  I won't buy them again.

With mine, I got as much air out of the bag as I could, by closing the bag as much as possible around a straw. I then sucked the air out until I could get no more air out, then slipped the straw out, whilst closing the bag in one swift motion.

As far as flavor goes...it's exactly as expected. A fair amount of corn-ness, not sweet. I added an egg (there's no obvious binder in the ingredient list) and about a tablespoon of sugar to two packages, and cut back on the milk by roughly half. They rose and browned nicely, and had great texture.  While these were fine from a flavor and convenience perspective, I would not buy again, unless the price was drastically lower.

This is a newer brand of beverage and it follows a trend toward healthier alternatives for every day foods and drinks- a trend that has been gaining steam as more and more individuals look for ways to improve their health.  This beverage offers a taste that is refreshing, but slightly different than what I expected. Yes, you get to experience the taste of juicy oranges and tangerines, but there are other flavors present as well and I couldn't quite put my finger on these other flavors until I read the ingredients and discovered that The Switch Orange Tangerine is also made with apple and grape juices. The grape is barely noticeable, but the apple can be detected and it, along with added soy, is responsible for the interesting taste sensation that you experience in the aftertaste.  The Switch Orange Tangerine is billed as a health drink and it does, indeed, have many positive selling points in terms of composition and nutrition. There is no added sugar, no artificial colors, no corn syrup, and no preservatives. The beverage is also gluten- free and provides one- hundred percent of the USRDA for Vitamin C and twenty percent of the USRDA for Vitamin A. There is no fat and no protein, either. But there are thirty- four grams of sugars and a fairly high level of calories. Granted, these are natural sugars but thirty- four grams is still a large amount and it won't be acceptable to those on low carb diets.  And with almost seventeen calories per ounce, the caloric content is higher than that of most soft drinks.  So, are there enough reasons to make the switch to The Switch Orange Tangerine? My answer is yes, due to both its good, refreshing taste and its better than average nutritional content. It isn't the greatest tasting orange beverage I have ever tried and it is more expensive than most other drinks, including regular orange juice. But it does have enough positive points to earn it a recommendation.", "output": "Make the Switch to a Healthier Beverage", "category": "Summarization 1216.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a review from Amazon's food products.

I purchased the 12 oz. bottle at a local store, and I must say it's one of the most addicting sauces I have ever had! I'm a pretty picky eater, and a vegetarian at that, so sauces play a key role in making an average meal a great one. This sauce is ALMOST perfect. It's very sweet, and has a strong garlic taste at first. It isn't as thick as the Red Hot brand, which I didn't like much at all (thick, not as flavorful, way too chunky). This sauce would be appropriate for children who like a little kick for their chicken nuggets and what not. My son loves spicy food just like his mommy. Another plus is there are only 70 calories in 2 tablespoons, and that much sauce goes a long way. 1 gram of fiber, too! The only thing I have a hard time with, and this is just a personal issue, is the texture of the red chilli. They tastes great, but they have a very thin, clear \"skin\" that has this horrible crunchy texture on some of the pieces. Not all, just some. I get it stuck in my mouth and on my teeth and it hits a nerve that makes me feel a bit queasy. Still, I eat it anyway lol and will continue to do so because this is one of the best sauces I have EVER tasted! I would recommend anyone to try this sauce first, and then try others if you are not fully satisfied. This sauce is amazing. It was about $1.50 at the store for 12 oz. but if you like the easiness of ordering online or can't find it near you, know that I would pay Amazon's price for it any day! Buy this sauce.
