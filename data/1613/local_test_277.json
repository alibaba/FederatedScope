Maternal smoking caused a significant rise in both IgE (p less than 0.05) and IgD (p less than 0.05), a finding that was most apparent in newborn infants with a negative biparental history of allergy (p less than 0.025 and p = 0.005, respectively). Furthermore, newborn infants of nonallergic parents had a more than threefold (p less than 0.01) higher incidence of elevated cord IgE (greater than or equal to 1.20 IU/ml) and a fourfold (p = 0.005) higher risk of developing definite or probable atopic disease before 18 months of age if the mother smoked than if she did not. Paternal smoking did not influence, in whatever the subgroup, cord IgE or subsequent infant allergy but increased cord IgD (p less than 0.001) among newborn infants with a negative family history even after controlling for maternal smoking (p less than 0.04). These results suggest that parental smoking in some way affects the fetal immune system, probably via substances in tobacco smoke. Maternal smoking in particular appears to exert a pronounced effect on the IgE system already in fetal life, predisposing even \"low-risk\" infants to subsequent sensitization, probably in synergy with a later acquired mucosal damage that would facilitate penetration of foreign matter. Pregnant women and mothers should be encouraged to try and give up smoking that might help to prevent allergic disease in their infants.", "output": "Female, Fetal Blood, Human, Hypersensitivity, IgD, IgE, Pregnancy, Retrospective Studies, Smoking, Support, Non-U.S. Gov't.", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1247.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, generate a keyword (a noun phrase) that best describes the focus or contribution of the paper.

The procedure is compared to the standard dissection tracheostomy method of Chevalier Jackson. This procedure has several advantages over the standard dissection method, the most significant of which appears to be the speed with which it can be performed. It can be done in 30 seconds, as opposed to the dissection procedure which requires 3 minutes or more for a surgeon to complete it. Autopsies on 14 of these patients are discussed. Long-term followup, that is for 1 year and more, is reported in 19 cases.

In the system model, arterial load is described by a modified windkessel load. The ejection pattern for a given cardiac output with fixed stroke volume and duration of ejection is predicted by minimizing a criterion that describes the total ventricular O2 consumption. The ejection patterns of the model closely resemble the observed ejection patterns. Also, the model predictions for changes in the values of the system parameters are qualitatively correct. The results strongly suggest that the control of ejection pattern satisfies the principle of energy cost minimization.", "output": "Animal, Cardiac Output, Comparative Study, Energy Metabolism, Heart Ventricle, Human, Models, Biological, Oxygen Consumption, Stroke Volume, Support, Non-U.S. Gov't.", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1247.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, generate a keyword (a noun phrase) that best describes the focus or contribution of the paper.

Fifty patients showed evidence of current flow through their bodies. These 50 victims were classified into two groups, the first consisting of 9 victims who showed rupture of their clothes or linear superficial dermal burns along their whole bodies from head to feet, indicating the occurrence of surface flashovers. The remaining 41 patients showed no evidence of this flash effect. It is noteworthy that in the first group 5 of the 9 survived, whereas in the second group only 6 among 41 survived. The result indicates that when a flashover occurs along the whole body, the probability of survival is higher than 50 per cent. The conditions which determine death or survival were investigated experimentally, imposing artificial lightning voltage impulses on rats and developing flashovers on them. The rats survived when the voltage drop caused by flashover occurred immediately after the peak point, and the current waveform exhibited a sharp peak. In contrast, the rats were killed when the voltage drop caused by flashover was delayed by more than 20 microseconds, and the current waveform showed a blunt cone shape. It has been concluded that a fast flashover appreciably diminishes the energy dissipation within the body and consequently results in survival.", "output": "Animal, Electric Injuries, Human, Lightning, Mice, Rats, Rats, Inbred Strains, Support, Non-U.S. Gov't.", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1247.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, generate a keyword (a noun phrase) that best describes the focus or contribution of the paper.

These models have used the serum creatinine level as either a reciprocal or logarithmic plot against time. The accuracy of such predictions are characterized by either a correlation coefficient (r value) or prediction error (time at which dialysis was predicted minus time at which dialysis actually occurred). Retrospectively, we analyzed 37 children who progressed to end-stage renal disease, grouped them by their respective primary diseases, and calculated both r values and prediction error for each individual and group. Although r values for each group (with the exception of patients less than 1 year of age) were comparable, prediction errors were widely disparate among the various groupings. Individuals within each of the groups had disparate values even though identical r values were present. These observations indicate that predictive models using serum creatinine levels are of limited clinical use and are least useful for patients younger than 1 year of age.", "output": "Creatinine, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Hemodialysis, Human, Infant, Kidney Failure, Chronic, Male, Mathematics, Models, Biological, Probability.", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1247.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, generate a keyword (a noun phrase) that best describes the focus or contribution of the paper.

Organization of prehospital providers of health care has improved the outcome of many patients, particularly the trauma patient and the acute cardiac patient. In Seattle as many as 40% of outside-the-hospital cardiac arrest victims with ventricular fibrillation have been saved when there is rapid delivery of basic life support by first responders followed by advanced life support by paramedics. Although these systems are growing and improving health care, many lack adequate medical control or physician involvement. Emergency medical service systems must have physicians involved in their management to meet their full capabilities. It has become apparent that four factors are critical in determining the ability to resuscitate an individual once a cardiac arrest has occurred: time to starting any of the rescue procedures, use of electrical defibrillation when indicated, use of epinephrine, and adequacy of the technique of basic life support, particularly the ventilation component. To provide defibrillation at the earliest possible time, defibrillation by first responders such as emergency medical technicians appears to be of benefit. With the advent of automatic and semiautomatic defibrillators, first responders and family members may also be able to defibrillate victims. The use of defibrillation by people with less training than paramedics, however, must be approached with caution to ensure that there is adequate medical control and that the individuals who use these devices are properly trained.", "output": "Electric Countershock, Emergency Medical Services, Human, Life Support Care, Resuscitation, Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, United States.", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1247.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, generate a keyword (a noun phrase) that best describes the focus or contribution of the paper.

One population is normal; the second population appears to have a deletion of about 10 amino acid residues from the middle of the triple helical domain. The mutation in pro alpha 2(I) causes increased posttranslational modification in the amino-terminal half of some pro alpha 1(I) chains, lowers the melting temperature of type I collagen molecules that incorporate a mutant pro alpha 2(I) chain, and prevents or delays the secretion of those molecules from fibroblasts in cell culture. On the basis of this study and linkage studies in additional families, it appears that the OI type IV phenotype is often the result of heterozygosity for mutations in pro alpha 2(I) that alter the triple helical structure of type I collagen.", "output": "Adolescence, Adult, Aged, Child, Child, Preschool, Chromosome Deletion, Female, Fibroblasts, Human, Linkage (Genetics), Male, Middle Age, Mutation, Osteogenesis Imperfecta, Procollagen, Protein Conformation, Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S..", "category": "Keyword Tagging 1247.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an abstract, generate a keyword (a noun phrase) that best describes the focus or contribution of the paper.

The etiology of transient global amnesia is poorly understood, although involvement of the medial temporal lobe is most likely. The literature suggests that once an underlying structural lesion has been ruled out, cases can be divided into three groups: patients with a past history of migraine headaches, those who have no obvious underlying precipitating factors, and those with associated neurologic deficits during a spell and risk factors for cerebrovascular disease. Patients in the first group tend to have attacks at an earlier age and to have an increased recurrence rate but, like those in the second group, have a good prognosis. Patients in the third group often have onset later in life, and as many as 10% may have a stroke or dementia. Whether or not this is a higher incidence than should be expected in persons of this age group has not been determined.
