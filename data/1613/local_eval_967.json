Your task is to summarize them.", "input": "Recommended Adult Immunization Schedule: United States, 2012* \n  \n Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices \u2020 From the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia. \n  \n The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) annually reviews the recommended Adult Immunization Schedule (Figures 1 and 2) to ensure that the schedule reflects current recommendations for licensed vaccines. In October 2011, ACIP approved the Adult Immunization Schedule for 2012, which includes several changes from 2011. A footnote directing readers to links for the full ACIP vaccine recommendations and where to find additional information on specific vaccine recommendations for travelers is now included. In addition, a table summarizing precautions and contraindications was added (Table). This table is based on the corresponding table in the 12th edition of Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases (1) and is included to provide ready access to key safety information for adult vaccine providers. \n  \n View larger version: Download as PowerPoint Slide Figure 1. Recommended Adult Immunization Schedule, by vaccine and age group. Footnotes are available on page 215. \n  \n View larger version: Download as PowerPoint Slide Figure 2. Vaccines that might be indicated for adults based on medical and other indications. Footnotes are available on page 215. \n  \n View this table: Table. Contraindications and Precautions to Commonly Used Vaccines in Adults \n  \n Changes to the footnote for the tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis (Tdap) and tetanus, diphtheria (Td) vaccines were made to update recommendations. Tdap vaccine is recommended specifically for persons who are close contacts of infants younger than 12 months of age (for example, parents, grandparents, and child care providers) and who have not received Tdap previously. Before 2011, vaccination postpartum was preferred for women who had not had a previous adult Tdap dose. However, in 2011, ACIP recommended that pregnant women preferentially receive Tdap vaccination during later pregnancy (>20 weeks' gestation). Other adults who are close contacts of children younger than 12 months of age continue to be recommended to receive a one-time dose of Tdap vaccine. \n  \n Updates to the footnotes and figures were also made for the human papillomavirus (HPV) and hepatitis B vaccines based on recommendations made at the October 2011 ACIP meeting. The HPV vaccine recommendation has been updated to include routine vaccination of males aged 11 to 12 years, with catch-up vaccination recommended for males aged 13 to 21 years. HPV vaccine also is recommended for previously unvaccinated males aged 22 to 26 years who are immunocompromised, who test positive for HIV infection, or who have sex with men. \n  \n ACIP also voted in October 2011 to recommend hepatitis B vaccine for adults younger than age 60 years who have diabetes, as soon as possible after diabetes is diagnosed. In addition, hepatitis B vaccination is recommended at the discretion of the treating clinician for adults with diabetes aged 60 years or older based on a patient's likely need for assisted blood glucose monitoring, likelihood of acquiring hepatitis B, and likelihood of immune response to vaccination. \n  \n A notation was included for the zoster vaccine to acknowledge that the vaccine was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for administration to persons 50 years of age and older; however, ACIP continues to recommend that vaccination begin at age 60 years. The influenza vaccine footnote was revised to specify age indications for the different licensed formulations of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV). The footnote for the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine was simplified to focus only on routine use of this vaccine in adults; information on use of the vaccine for outbreak control was removed. Readers are referred to the ACIP MMR recommendations and to the ACIP recommendations for the immunization of health-care personnel (HCP) regarding the use of MMR vaccine in outbreak settings. Additional information on the use of quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4) and meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4) for specific age and risk groups was added. Minor clarifications also were made to the footnotes for HPV vaccine, varicella vaccine, and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV). \n  \n Additional information is available as follows: 1) immunization schedule (in English and Spanish) at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/schedules/adult-schedule.htm; 2) information regarding adult vaccination at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/default.htm; 3) ACIP statements for specific vaccines at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/ACIP-list.htm#vacc; and 4) reporting of adverse events at www.vaers.hhs.gov or by telephone, 800-822-7967. The recommended Adult Immunization Schedule has been approved by the ACIP, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American College of Physicians, and the American College of Nurse-Midwives. \n  \n Next Section Changes to the Schedule for 2012 A new footnote, Additional information (footnote 1), has been added to the beginning of the footnotes. This footnote provides links to the full ACIP vaccine recommendations and information on travel requirements that may have been referred to previously in subsequent footnotes. The influenza vaccination footnote (footnote 2) was revised to clarify that all persons aged 6 months or older can receive TIV and that HCP who care for persons requiring a protected environment should receive TIV. Health-care personnel younger than 50 years who do not have a contraindication may receive either the live attenuated influenza vaccine or TIV. In addition, age indications for 2 recently licensed formulations of TIV were included. The link to additional information regarding influenza vaccination has been removed because a link now is provided in footnote 1. The HPV vaccination footnote (footnote 5) now clarifies that although HPV vaccination is not specifically recommended for HCP, they should receive the vaccine if they are in the recommended age group. This footnote was also changed to reflect the recommendation of the quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV4) vaccine for males aged 11 or 12 years and catch-up vaccination for males 13 to 21 years of age. Males aged 22 to 26 years may be vaccinated with HPV4 vaccine. The zoster vaccination footnote (footnote 6) now indicates that although zoster vaccination is not specifically recommended for HCP, they should receive the vaccine if they are in the recommended age group. This footnote also acknowledges that the vaccine is FDA-approved for use in persons aged 50 years or older; however, ACIP continues to recommend that vaccination begin at age 60 years. The link in the MMR vaccination footnote (footnote 7) that directs the reader to more information about evidence of immunity has been removed. In addition, the information about the use of the MMR vaccine in outbreak settings has been removed. Readers are referred to the ACIP MMR recommendations and to the ACIP recommendations for the immunization of HCP regarding the use of MMR vaccine in outbreak settings. The PPSV vaccination footnote (footnote 8) has been revised to include additional examples of functional and anatomic asplenia. Language is included for persons with asymptomatic or symptomatic HIV infection and persons undergoing cancer chemotherapy or who are on other immunosuppressive therapy. The revaccination with PPSV footnote (footnote 9) has been revised to clarify guidance for those persons aged 65 years or older who had been vaccinated with PPSV23 before age 65 years and for whom at least 5 years has passed since their previous dose. The meningococcal vaccination footnote (footnote 10) has been revised to include military recruits in the group recommended to receive a single dose of meningococcal vaccine. The language about college students has been clarified to indicate that first-year college students up through age 21 years who are living in residence halls should be vaccinated if they have not received a dose on or after their 16th birthday. Language regarding travel to sub-Saharan Africa and travel to Mecca has been removed, and readers are referred to the footnote on information about vaccines for travelers (1). The hepatitis B vaccination footnote (footnote 12) has been revised to include persons with diabetes younger than age 60 years and persons aged 60 years or older based on need for assisted blood glucose monitoring. Finally, all footnotes were changed from paragraph form to a bulleted format to provide for greater ease in use of the recommendations. \n  \n Previous Section Next Section Changes to the Figures For Figure 1, the bar for Tdap/Td for persons aged 65 years or older has been changed to a yellow and purple hashed bar to indicate that persons in this age group should receive 1 dose of Tdap if they are a close contact of an infant younger than 12 months of age. However, other persons aged 65 years or older who are not close contacts of infants may receive either Tdap or Td. The age group of 19 to 26 years was divided into 19 to 21 years and 22 to 26 years. The HPV vaccine bar was split into separate bars for females and males. The recommendation for all males aged 19 to 21 years to receive HPV is indicated with a yellow bar, and a purple bar is used for males aged 22 to 26 years to indicate that the vaccine is only for certain high-risk groups. For Figure 2, a new column was added for men who have sex with men (MSM) to note in the figure that MSM is an indication for HPV, hepatitis A, and hepatitis B vaccines. In addition, the diabetes indication was moved to the same column as chronic kidney disease in order to accommodate the new recommendation for hepatitis B vaccination of persons with diabetes. Because pregnant women not previously vaccinated with Tdap are now preferentially recommended for vaccination with Tdap during later pregnancy (>20 weeks' gestation), the yellow bar has been extended across all risk groups. The HPV vaccine bar was separated into a bar for females and one for males. The bar for females is unchanged from the prior year except that it was extended to include HCP to clarify that HCP who are in the recommended age group for receipt of HPV vaccine are recommended for vaccination. Lastly, the HPV vaccine bar for males was added and indicates that all males through age 26 years should be vaccinated if they are immunocompromised, have HIV, or are MSM. However, the age indication is through age 21 years for males with or without these risk factors. \n  \n Previous Section Next Section Footnotes Recommended Adult Immunization Schedule\u2014United States, 2012 1. Additional information Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) vaccine recommendations and additional information are available at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/acip-list.htm. Information on travel vaccine requirements and recommendations (e.g., for hepatitis A and B, meningococcal, and other vaccines) available at wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/vaccinations.htm. 2. Influenza vaccination Annual vaccination against influenza is recommended for all persons 6 months of age and older. Persons 6 months of age and older, including pregnant women, can receive the trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV). Healthy, nonpregnant adults younger than age 50 years without high-risk medical conditions can receive either intranasally administered live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) (FluMist), or TIV. Health-care personnel who care for severely immunocompromised persons (i.e., those who require care in a protected environment) should receive TIV rather than LAIV. Other persons should receive TIV. The intramuscular or intradermal administered TIV are options for adults aged 18\u201364 years. Adults aged 65 years and older can receive the standard dose TIV or the high-dose TIV (Fluzone High-Dose). 3. Tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Td/Tdap) vaccination Administer a one-time dose of Tdap to adults younger than age 65 years who have not received Tdap previously or for whom vaccine status is unknown to replace one of the 10-year Td boosters. Tdap is specifically recommended for the following persons: \u2014 pregnant women at more than 20 weeks' gestation; \u2014 adults, regardless of age, who are close contacts of infants younger than age 12 months (e.g., parents, grandparents, or child-care providers); and \u2014 HCP. Tdap can be administered regardless of interval since the most recent tetanus or diphtheria-containing vaccine. Pregnant women not vaccinated during pregnancy should receive Tdap immediately postpartum. Adults aged 65 years and older may receive Tdap. Adults with unknown or incomplete history of completing a 3-dose primary vaccination series with Td-containing vaccines should begin or complete a primary vaccination series. Tdap should be substituted for a single dose of Td in the vaccination series with Tdap preferred as the first dose. For unvaccinated adults, administer the first 2 doses at least 4 weeks apart and the third dose 6\u201312 months after the second. If incompletely vaccinated (i.e., less than 3 doses), administer remaining doses. Refer to the ACIP statement for recommendations for administering Td/Tdap as prophylaxis in wound management. (See footnote 1.) 4. Varicella vaccination All adults without evidence of immunity to varicella (as defined below) should receive 2 doses of single-antigen varicella vaccine or a second dose if they have received only 1 dose. Special consideration for vaccination should be given to those who: \u2014 have close contact with persons at high risk for severe disease (e.g., HCP and family contacts of persons with immunocompromising conditions); or \u2014 are at high risk for exposure or transmission (e.g., teachers; child-care employees; residents and staff members of institutional settings, including correctional institutions; college students; military personnel; adolescents and adults living in households with children; nonpregnant women of childbearing age; and international travelers). Pregnant women should be assessed for evidence of varicella immunity. Women who do not have evidence of immunity should receive the first dose of varicella vaccine upon completion or termination of pregnancy and before discharge from the health-care facility. The second dose should be administered 4\u20138 weeks after the first dose. Evidence of immunity to varicella in adults includes any of the following: \u2014 documentation of 2 doses of varicella vaccine at least 4 weeks apart; \u2014 U.S.-born before 1980 (although for HCP and pregnant women, birth before 1980 should not be considered evidence of immunity); \u2014 history of varicella based on diagnosis or verification of varicella by a health-care provider (for a patient reporting a history of or having an atypical case, a mild case, or both, health-care providers should seek either an epidemiologic link to a typical varicella case or to a laboratory-confirmed case or evidence of laboratory confirmation, if it was performed at the time of acute disease); \u2014 history of herpes zoster based on diagnosis or verification of herpes zoster by a health-care provider; or \u2014 laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease. 5. Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination Two vaccines are licensed for use in females, bivalent HPV vaccine (HPV2) and quadrivalent HPV vaccine (HPV4), and one HPV vaccine for use in males (HPV4). For females, either HPV4 or HPV2 is recommended in a 3-dose series for routine vaccination at 11 or 12 years of age, and for those aged 13\u201326 years, if not previously vaccinated. For males, HPV4 is recommended in a 3-dose series for routine vaccination at age 11 or 12 years and for those aged 13\u201321 years, if not previously vaccinated. Males aged 22\u201326 years may be vaccinated. HPV vaccines are not live vaccines and can be administered to persons who are immunocompromised as a result of infection (including HIV infection), disease, or medications. Vaccine is recommended for immunocompromised persons through age 26 years who did not receive any or all doses when they were younger. The immune response and vaccine efficacy might be less than that in immunocompetent persons. Men who have sex with men (MSM) may especially benefit from vaccination to prevent condyloma and anal cancer. HPV4 is recommended for MSM through age 26 years who did not get any or all doses when they were younger. Ideally, vaccine should be administered before potential exposure to HPV through sexual activity; however, persons who are sexually active should still be vaccinated consistent with age-based recommendations. HPV vaccine can be administered to persons with a history of genital warts, abnormal Papanicolaou test results, or positive HPV DNA test results. A complete series for either HPV4 or HPV2 consists of 3 doses. The second dose should be administered 1\u20132 months after the first dose; the third dose should be administered 6 months after the first dose (at least 24 weeks after the first dose). Although HPV vaccination is not specifically recommended for HCP based on their occupation, they should receive the HPV vaccine if they are in the recommended age group. 6. Zoster vaccination A single dose of zoster vaccine is recommended for adults aged 60 years and older regardless of whether they report a prior episode of herpes zoster. Although the vaccine is licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use among and can be administered to persons aged 50 years and older, ACIP recommends that vaccination begins at age 60 years. Persons with chronic medical conditions may be vaccinated unless their condition constitutes a contraindication, such as pregnancy or severe immunodeficiency. Although zoster vaccination is not specifically recommended for HCP, they should receive the vaccine if they are in the recommended age group. 7. Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccination Adults born before 1957 generally are considered immune to measles and mumps. All adults born in 1957 or later should have documentation of 1 or more doses of MMR vaccine unless they have a medical contraindication to the vaccine, laboratory evidence of immunity to each of the 3 diseases, or documentation of provider-diagnosed measles or mumps disease. For rubella, documentation of provider-diagnosed disease is not considered acceptable evidence of immunity. Measles component: A routine second dose of MMR vaccine, administered a minimum of 28 days after the first dose, is recommended for adults who: \u2014 are students in postsecondary educational institutions; \u2014 work in a health-care facility; or \u2014 plan to travel internationally. Persons who received inactivated (killed) measles vaccine or measles vaccine of unknown type from 1963 to 1967 should be revaccinated with 2 doses of MMR vaccine. Mumps component: A routine second dose of MMR vaccine, administered a minimum of 28 days after the first dose, is recommended for adults who: \u2014 are students in postsecondary educational institutions; \u2014 work in a health-care facility; or \u2014 plan to travel internationally. Persons vaccinated before 1979 with either killed mumps vaccine or mumps vaccine of unknown type who are at high risk for mumps infection (e.g., persons who are working in a health-care facility) should be considered for revaccination with 2 doses of MMR vaccine. Rubella component: For women of childbearing age, regardless of birth year, rubella immunity should be determined. If there is no evidence of immunity, women who are not pregnant should be vaccinated. Pregnant women who do not have evidence of immunity should receive MMR vaccine upon completion or termination of pregnancy and before discharge from the health-care facility. HCP born before 1957: For unvaccinated HCP born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of measles, mumps, and/or rubella immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease, health-care facilities should consider routinely vaccinating personnel with 2 doses of MMR vaccine at the appropriate interval for measles and mumps or 1 dose of MMR vaccine for rubella. 8. Pneumococcal polysaccharide (PPSV) vaccination Vaccinate all persons with the following indications: \u2014 aged 65 years and older without a history of PPSV vaccination; \u2014 adults younger than age 65 years with chronic lung disease (including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, and asthma); chronic cardiovascular diseases; diabetes mellitus; chronic liver disease (including cirrhosis); alcoholism; cochlear implants; cerebrospinal fluid leaks; immunocompromising conditions; and functional or anatomic asplenia (e.g., sickle cell disease and other hemoglobinopathies, congenital or acquired asplenia, splenic dysfunction, or splenectomy [if elective splenectomy is planned, vaccinate at least 2 weeks before surgery]); \u2014 residents of nursing homes or long-term care facilities; and \u2014 adults who smoke cigarettes. Persons with asymptomatic or symptomatic HIV infection should be vaccinated as soon as possible after their diagnosis. When cancer chemotherapy or other immunosuppressive therapy is being considered, the interval between vaccination and initiation of immunosuppressive therapy should be at least 2 weeks. Vaccination during chemotherapy or radiation therapy should be avoided. Routine use of PPSV is not recommended for American Indians/Alaska Natives or other persons younger than 65 years of age unless they have underlying medical conditions that are PPSV indications. However, public health authorities may consider recommending PPSV for American Indians or Alaska Natives who are living in areas where the risk for invasive pneumococcal disease is increased. 9. Revaccination with PPSV One-time revaccination 5 years after the first dose is recommended for persons aged 19\u201364 years of age with chronic renal failure or nephrotic syndrome; functional or anatomic asplenia (e.g., sickle cell disease or splenectomy); and immunocompromising conditions. Persons who received PPSV before age 65 years for any indication should receive another dose of the vaccine at age 65 years or later if at least 5 years have passed since their previous dose. No further doses are needed for persons vaccinated with PPSV at or after age 65 years. 10. Meningococcal vaccination Administer 2 doses of meningococcal conjugate vaccine quadrivalent (MCV4) at least 2 months apart to adults with functional asplenia or persistent complement component deficiencies. HIV-infected persons who are vaccinated should also receive 2 doses. Administer a single dose of meningococcal vaccine to microbiologists routinely exposed to isolates of Neisseria meningitidis, military recruits, and persons who travel to or live in countries in which meningococcal disease is hyperendemic or epidemic. First-year college students up through age 21 years who are living in residence halls should be vaccinated if they have not received a dose on or after their 16th birthday. MCV4 is preferred for adults with any of the preceding indications who are aged 55 years and younger; meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4) is preferred for adults aged 56 years and older. Revaccination with MCV4 every 5 years is recommended for adults previously vaccinated with MCV4 or MPSV4 who remain at increased risk for infection (e.g., adults with anatomic or functional asplenia or persistent complement component deficiencies). 11. Hepatitis A vaccination Vaccinate any person seeking protection from hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection and persons with any of the following indications: \u2014 MSM and persons who use injection drugs; \u2014 persons working with HAV-infected primates or with HAV in a research laboratory setting; \u2014 persons with chronic liver disease and persons who receive clotting factor concentrates; \u2014 persons traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A; and \u2014 unvaccinated persons who anticipate close personal contact (e.g., household or regular babysitting) with an international adoptee during the first 60 days after arrival in the United States from a country with high or intermediate endemicity. (See footnote 1 for more information on travel recommendations.) The first dose of the 2-dose hepatitis A vaccine series should be administered as soon as adoption is planned, ideally 2 or more weeks before the arrival of the adoptee. Single-antigen vaccine formulations should be administered in a 2-dose schedule at either 0 and 6\u201312 months (Havrix), or 0 and 6\u201318 months (Vaqta). If the combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine (Twinrix) is used, administer 3 doses at 0, 1, and 6 months; alternatively, a 4-dose schedule may be used, administered on days 0, 7, and 21\u201330 followed by a booster dose at month 12. 12. Hepatitis B vaccination Vaccinate persons with any of the following indications and any person seeking protection from hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. \u2014 sexually active persons who are not in a long-term, mutually monogamous relationship (e.g., persons with more than 1 sex partner during the previous 6 months); persons seeking evaluation or treatment for a sexually transmitted disease (STD); current or recent injection-drug users; and MSM; \u2014 HCP and public-safety workers who are exposed to blood or other potentially infectious body fluids; \u2014 persons with diabetes younger than 60 years as soon as feasible after diagnosis; persons with diabetes who are aged 60 years or older at the discretion of the treating clinician based on increased need for assisted blood glucose monitoring in long-term care facilities, likelihood of acquiring hepatitis B infection, its complications, or chronic sequelae, and likelihood of immune response to vaccination; \u2014 persons with end-stage renal disease, including patients receiving hemodialysis; persons with HIV infection; and persons with chronic liver disease; \u2014 household contacts and sex partners of persons with chronic HBV infection; clients and staff members of institutions for persons with developmental disabilities; and international travelers to countries with high or intermediate prevalence of chronic HBV infection; and \u2014 all adults in the following settings: STD treatment facilities; HIV testing and treatment facilities; facilities providing drug-abuse treatment and prevention services; health-care settings targeting services to injection-drug users or MSM; correctional facilities; end-stage renal disease programs and facilities for chronic hemodialysis patients; and institutions and nonresidential day-care facilities for persons with developmental disabilities. Administer missing doses to complete a 3-dose series of hepatitis B vaccine to those persons not vaccinated or not completely vaccinated. The second dose should be administered 1 month after the first dose; the third dose should be given at least 2 months after the second dose (and at least 4 months after the first dose). If the combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine (Twinrix) is used, give 3 doses at 0, 1, and 6 months; alternatively, a 4-dose Twinrix schedule, administered on days 0, 7, and 21\u201330 followed by a booster dose at month 12 may be used. Adult patients receiving hemodialysis or with other immunocompromising conditions should receive 1 dose of 40 mcg/mL (Recombivax HB) administered on a 3-dose schedule or 2 doses of 20 mcg/mL (Engerix-B) administered simultaneously on a 4-dose schedule at 0, 1, 2, and 6 months. 13. Selected conditions for which Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) vaccine may be used One dose of Hib vaccine should be considered for persons who have sickle cell disease, leukemia, or HIV infection, or who have anatomic or functional asplenia if they have not previously received Hib vaccine. 14. Immunocompromising conditions Inactivated vaccines generally are acceptable (e.g., pneumococcal, meningococcal, and influenza [inactivated influenza vaccine]) and live vaccines generally are avoided in persons with immune deficiencies or immunocompromising conditions. Information on specific conditions is available at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/acip-list.htm. \n  \n Previous Section Next Section Appendix: Members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices Carol J.

After a Dallas hospital confirmed the body through dental records, it was reburied, but not in the original casket, which was too water-damaged. \n  \n Oswald's family says it thought the original casket had been thrown away, but the funeral home actually kept it in storage before selling it at auction \u2014 along with Lee Harvey Oswald's death certificate and the embalming tools and table used in his burial \u2014 to an anonymous buyer. \n  \n Oswald's brother, Robert, sued Baumgardner Funeral Home after it sold the coffin through an auction house in Santa Monica, California. The auction house still has the coffin, because the lawsuit had put the sale of the coffin on hold. The sale was never completed, the judgment says. \n  \n In addition to returning the casket to Robert Oswald, the funeral home must pay him $87,468 in damages, a Tarrant County judge ruled, saying its conduct was \"wrongful, wanton and malicious.\" \n  \n It also must pay the auction house more than $10,000 in storage fees. \n  \n The funeral home also must cover the expense of transporting the coffin from California to Texas, where the family plans to destroy it, according to Oswald's attorney, Gant Grimes. \n  \n Lee Harvey Oswald, accused of assassinating President John F.

White Nationalist leader. Spewer of hate. Federal informant. \n  \n \"I joined the family in Sioux City, Iowa,\" Miller wrote later in his self-published autobiography. \"I enrolled in truck driving school\u2026and I've been trucking ever since. And I love it. After prison, the freedom of the open road is gloriously exhilarating.\" \n  \n THE KKK'S 1994 FIGHT TO GET ON CABLE TV \n  \n Less than three years earlier Miller had been a fugitive from justice, the subject of a nationwide manhunt after he had declared war on blacks and Jews, exhorting his thousands of followers to violently overthrow the very government that would soon become his protector. \n  \n \"Let the blood of our enemies flood the streets, rivers and fields of the nation,\" Miller wrote. \"[R]ise up and throw off the chains which bind us to the satanic, Jewish controlled and ruled federal government. Let the battle axes swing smoothly and the bullets wiss [sic] true.\" \n  \n DECLARATION OF WAR \n  \n In the early morning hours of April 30, 1987, more than three dozen federal and state law enforcement agents surrounded a mobile home in Ozark, Missouri. A van recently purchased by Miller in Louisiana had been spotted outside by an agent the day before. \n  \n A volley of tear gas was fired and then, just after 7 a.m, four men emerged and gave themselves up. \n  \n Among them was Miller, the founder of Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and the paramilitary White Patriot Party in North Carolina. The United States Marshals Service had issued a nationwide bulletin seeking Miller's arrest after he disappeared while appealing his conviction for criminal contempt. \n  \n KKK MEMBER CONVICTED IN 1963 MURDERS OF 4 GIRLS \n  \n A 1987 United States Marshals Service \"wanted\" poster shows Frazier Glenn Miller. (United States Marshals Service) \n  \n Agents recovered hand grenades, automatic rifles, pistols and flak jackets inside the trailer, according to FBI statements at the time. Explosives experts from nearby Fort Leonard Wood were called in to detonate a box containing about twenty pipe bombs. \n  \n The authorities also found a Xerox machine and about a thousand copies of Miller's \"Declaration of War.\" During his 10 days on the run, Miller had mailed his typewritten call to arms to thousands of white nationalists, as well as members of Congress and dozens of media outlets. \n  \n \"I realize fully that I will be caught quickly,\" Miller had written in his letter. \"[B]ut I will die with contempt on my lips and with sword in my hand. My fate will either be assassination or the death penalty.\" \n  \n But faced with an array of charges that could have put him behind bars for 20 years or more, Miller's bombast was quickly reduced to a squeal. Within days of his arrest, he was signalling his willingness to make a deal. \n  \n \"He stated that it was 'all a bluff that got out of hand,'\" according to an FBI agent's notes, obtained by ABC News, of an interview with Miller a few weeks after his arrest. \"[H]aving spent eight days in jail and having the opportunity to dry out from excessive alcohol consumption, he has learned to develop tolerance. He stated emphatically that he would never hurt anybody,\" the agent wrote in recounting Miller's statements. \n  \n Among those present for the initial interviews with Miller was then-federal prosecutor J. Douglas McCullough, now a judge on the North Carolina state court of appeals. \n  \n Steve Daniels, an anchor for ABC affiliate WTVD, interviewed McCullough this week in Raleigh. \n  \n \"He tried to be a little bit self-serving,\" McCullough said of Miller during the interview. \"Every defendant in those situations usually is at first. But he did open up about a lot of things about the White Patriot Party. He detailed a number of people that were involved in illegal activities that were his associates. And that's what we were looking for. \" \n  \n In a series of ensuing interviews with federal and North Carolina investigators, Miller never denied his racist and anti-Semitic views, but claimed he had always denounced violence and illegal activity. \n  \n \"Miller wanted nothing more to do with the movement,\" according to an FBI account of an interview in June of 1987. He was \"willing to turn his back on it in order to return to his family. His problem in the past had been intolerance linked with excessive drinking.\" \n  \n A month later, in an interview with the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation, during which he accused two of his former comrades of murder, he described his time on the run from the law as little more than a lark. \n  \n \"I was on vacation, flirting with girls and drinking beer and going red-necking,\" Miller told the agents. \"I love to go out and drink a beer with rednecks\u2026do the Texas Two-Step. I'm a pretty good dancer by the way,\" he said. \n  \n SHOCKING ALLEGATIONS \n  \n In the course of their investigation, authorities also learned the stunning details of Miller's arrest a year earlier. Raleigh police officers had caught Miller in the back seat of a vehicle, in mid-act with a black male prostitute masquerading as a woman. \n  \n \"It was pretty shocking,\" says McCullough, \"because of his personal stances that he had taken and what he was now accused on engaging in.\" \n  \n McCullough says he has read the police report of the incident but declined to comment on the specifics. \"I would rather not go into the details,\" he said. \"They're rather salacious. I think the facts speak for themselves and people can draw their own conclusions about how incongruous that is.\" \n  \n Miller was not charged in connection with the prostitution arrest and no public record of the incident could be located. But in a recorded phone call with the Southern Poverty Law Center last fall, Miller claimed that he had lured the prostitute to the meeting with the intention of beating him. \n  \n Eventually, McCullough, the federal prosecutor, would approve a plea deal with Miller recommending a five-year prison sentence in exchange for his cooperation and testimony against his former compatriots. He would serve less than three years of that sentence at a prison in western New York. \n  \n \"I am not certain that we got 100 percent of what we wanted,\" McCullough told WTVD. \"He did testify in a couple of cases here in the eastern part of the state, or agreed to testify where the people plead guilty knowing he was going to testify.\" \n  \n In 1998, Miller was a key witness in a high-profile federal trial that charged more than a dozen white nationalists in an alleged conspiracy to levy war against the United States government. The Department of Justice had called it Operation Clean Sweep. Miller testified that he had received two payments totaling $200,000 from a leader of the alleged conspiracy, but in the end all of those accused were acquitted and, incredibly, one of the jurors later married one of the defendants. \n  \n \"His testimony was extremely weak,\" says Leonard Zeskind, who tracked Miller's activities in the 1980's as research director for the Center for the Democratic Renewal, a civil rights group fighting Klan activities. \n  \n \"I believe that Miller was essentially playing a game with the feds. And I don't think he had any intention of becoming a good witness. T he guy was a stone-to-the-bone Nazi,\" Zeskind says. \"He never gave that up. I am on the record as saying the man should have died in prison.\" \n  \n But McCullough says that nothing would have changed what happened last week in Kansas. Even if he had refused to deal with Miller back in 1987, he would have spent no more than fifteen years in prison. \n  \n \"We made the deal that we could make at the time and whether it's right or wrong, it's really kind of immaterial at this point,\" McCullough says. \"Human beings are unpredictable. I don't think there is anybody who could know what he was capable of doing,\" he said of the shootings in Kansas. \"I certainly never saw that in his personality. He was a blowhard who liked to be in front of a crowd. He liked to whip the crowd up and get the emotions running high.\" \n  \n Very little is known of the years Miller spent in Iowa and Nebraska living as Frazier Glenn Cross. \n  \n \"He asked for protection from both the White Patriot Party people and blacks in prison because he had alienated both groups,\" says McCullough. \"Obviously once he served his sentence he couldn't go back to where his old compatriots were because he would be at risk. So we had to put him somewhere safe.\" \n  \n It's clear that Cross eventually discarded his assumed identity provided by the federal government and resumed his life as the belligerent, unapologetic white supremacist, Frazier Glenn Miller. \n  \n And no one, it seems, could predict the tragic consequences that would follow. ||||| Frazier Glenn Miller, the ex-klansman and lifelong bigot who faces trial for killing three people at two Kansas Jewish centers earlier this month, ran up quite a rap sheet\u2014including the time cops caught him in a car having sex with a black male prostitute dressed as a woman. \n  \n That revelation was part of a long, deep investigation into Miller's chilling background as a self-styled soldier for the white nationalist cause. \n  \n In the late '80s, Miller\u2014who founded the Carolina Dragons of the Ku Klux Klan and the White Patriot Party\u2014struck a plea deal with federal prosecutors to roll over on his white brothers in the cause and avoid a long prison stretch. After leaving prison, the feds changed his name to Frazier Glenn Cross and tried to start his life anew, albeit with just as much racism and more violence. \n  \n But now we can understand why Miller was so quick to accede to a quickie name makeover.

But in a recorded phone call with the Southern Poverty Law Center last fall, Miller claimed that he had lured the prostitute to the meeting with the intention of beating him. \n  \n It's hard to know how to process this. Especially breathtaking is Miller's assumption that the criminal (and, to his mind, moral) offense of fucking a black male hooker was mitigated by the fact that, hey, he was totally planning to beat up that hooker. \n  \n As we all now know, Miller was capable of much, much worse. Yet his old prosecutors point out that even if he'd never cooperated with them, he still would have been a free man by now, and he still probably would have been able to pull off his anti-semitic massacre in Kansas. \n  \n \"The guy was a stone-to-the-bone Nazi,\" one anti-racist researcher told ABC. \"He never gave that up.

ZHANG BINGQING/CHINA DAILY \n  \n A 33-year-old worker at a logistics company's packaging shop in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, made headlines when he shared his calculations about number patterns with mathematics PhD candidates at Zhejiang University recently. \n  \n The worker, Yu Jianchun, is from mountainous Xinxian county in Henan province. He graduated from a technology training school in Zhengzhou, Henan province. \n  \n Although he had little higher education and was a migrant worker after graduation, Yu maintains his interest in mathematics and spends almost all of his spare time studying it. \n  \n Over time, he developed an interest in Carmichael numbers, a kind of pseudo-prime numbers that occur as positive integers about 255 times per 100 million. Yu came up with five formulas that Cai Tianxin, a math professor at Zhejiang University, found inspiring. \n  \n \"I made my discoveries through intuition,\" Yu said. \"I would write down what I thought when inspirations struck about the Carmichael. I have hard work and make a hard living, but I insist on my studies.\" \n  \n Yu was a migrant worker in many places, and everywhere he went, he would visit the math professors at the local university, hoping to get confirmation of his formulas. \n  \n Yu said he spent eight years developing the Carmichael formulas. He has reached out to academics through emails. Cai was the first to respond. \n  \n Cai found a formula proposed by Yu to be a more efficient way of identifying Carmichael numbers and invited him to share his thinking at the university with faculty members and doctoral and postdoctoral students in a class on June 13. \n  \n Six professors and advanced students in Zhejiang University's math department listened to Yu's lecture. Some of the experts considered Yu's idea to be a \"novelty\", while some said \"his results have a certain depth\". \n  \n Cai decided to include Yu's formula with his latest work in English, and he gave Yu a book to help the logistics worker in further study. \n  \n  \n  \n  ||||| In number theory, a Carmichael number is a composite number n {\\displaystyle n} which satisfies the modular arithmetic congruence relation: \n  \n b n \u2212 1 \u2261 1 ( mod n ) {\\displaystyle b^{n-1}\\equiv 1{\\pmod {n}}} \n  \n for all integers b {\\displaystyle b} which are relatively prime to n {\\displaystyle n} . [1] They are named for Robert Carmichael. The Carmichael numbers are the subset K 1 of the Kn\u00f6del numbers. \n  \n Equivalently, a Carmichael number is a composite number n {\\displaystyle n} for which \n  \n b n \u2261 b ( mod n ) {\\displaystyle b^{n}\\equiv b{\\pmod {n}}} \n  \n for all integers b {\\displaystyle b} . [2] \n  \n Overview [ edit ] \n  \n Fermat's little theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer b, the number b p \u2212 b is an integer multiple of p. Carmichael numbers are composite numbers which have this property. Carmichael numbers are also called Fermat pseudoprimes or absolute Fermat pseudoprimes. A Carmichael number will pass a Fermat primality test to every base b relatively prime to the number, even though it is not actually prime. This makes tests based on Fermat's Little Theorem less effective than strong probable prime tests such as the Baillie-PSW primality test and the Miller\u2013Rabin primality test. \n  \n However, no Carmichael number is either an Euler-Jacobi pseudoprime or a strong pseudoprime to every base relatively prime to it [3] so, in theory, either an Euler or a strong probable prime test could prove that a Carmichael number is, in fact, composite. \n  \n As numbers become larger, Carmichael numbers become increasingly rare. For example, there are 20,138,200 Carmichael numbers between 1 and 1021 (approximately one in 50 trillion (5\u00b71013) numbers).[4] \n  \n Korselt's criterion [ edit ] \n  \n An alternative and equivalent definition of Carmichael numbers is given by Korselt's criterion. \n  \n Theorem (A. Korselt 1899): A positive composite integer n {\\displaystyle n} n {\\displaystyle n} square-free, and for all prime divisors p {\\displaystyle p} n {\\displaystyle n} p \u2212 1 \u2223 n \u2212 1 {\\displaystyle p-1\\mid n-1} \n  \n It follows from this theorem that all Carmichael numbers are odd, since any even composite number that is square-free (and hence has only one prime factor of two) will have at least one odd prime factor, and thus p \u2212 1 \u2223 n \u2212 1 {\\displaystyle p-1\\mid n-1} results in an even dividing an odd, a contradiction. (The oddness of Carmichael numbers also follows from the fact that \u2212 1 {\\displaystyle -1} is a Fermat witness for any even composite number.) From the criterion it also follows that Carmichael numbers are cyclic.[5][6] Additionally, it follows that there are no Carmichael numbers with exactly two prime factors. \n  \n Discovery [ edit ] \n  \n Korselt was the first who observed the basic properties of Carmichael numbers, but he did not give any examples. In 1910, Carmichael[7] found the first and smallest such number, 561, which explains the name \"Carmichael number\". \n  \n That 561 is a Carmichael number can be seen with Korselt's criterion. Indeed, 561 = 3 \u22c5 11 \u22c5 17 {\\displaystyle 561=3\\cdot 11\\cdot 17} is square-free and 2 \u2223 560 {\\displaystyle 2\\mid 560} , 10 \u2223 560 {\\displaystyle 10\\mid 560} and 16 \u2223 560 {\\displaystyle 16\\mid 560} . \n  \n The next six Carmichael numbers are (sequence A002997 in the OEIS): \n  \n 1105 = 5 \u22c5 13 \u22c5 17 ( 4 \u2223 1104 ; 12 \u2223 1104 ; 16 \u2223 1104 ) {\\displaystyle 1105=5\\cdot 13\\cdot 17\\qquad (4\\mid 1104;\\quad 12\\mid 1104;\\quad 16\\mid 1104)} 1729 = 7 \u22c5 13 \u22c5 19 ( 6 \u2223 1728 ; 12 \u2223 1728 ; 18 \u2223 1728 ) {\\displaystyle 1729=7\\cdot 13\\cdot 19\\qquad (6\\mid 1728;\\quad 12\\mid 1728;\\quad 18\\mid 1728)} 2465 = 5 \u22c5 17 \u22c5 29 ( 4 \u2223 2464 ; 16 \u2223 2464 ; 28 \u2223 2464 ) {\\displaystyle 2465=5\\cdot 17\\cdot 29\\qquad (4\\mid 2464;\\quad 16\\mid 2464;\\quad 28\\mid 2464)} 2821 = 7 \u22c5 13 \u22c5 31 ( 6 \u2223 2820 ; 12 \u2223 2820 ; 30 \u2223 2820 ) {\\displaystyle 2821=7\\cdot 13\\cdot 31\\qquad (6\\mid 2820;\\quad 12\\mid 2820;\\quad 30\\mid 2820)} 6601 = 7 \u22c5 23 \u22c5 41 ( 6 \u2223 6600 ; 22 \u2223 6600 ; 40 \u2223 6600 ) {\\displaystyle 6601=7\\cdot 23\\cdot 41\\qquad (6\\mid 6600;\\quad 22\\mid 6600;\\quad 40\\mid 6600)} 8911 = 7 \u22c5 19 \u22c5 67 ( 6 \u2223 8910 ; 18 \u2223 8910 ; 66 \u2223 8910 ) . {\\displaystyle 8911=7\\cdot 19\\cdot 67\\qquad (6\\mid 8910;\\quad 18\\mid 8910;\\quad 66\\mid 8910).} \n  \n These first seven Carmichael numbers, from 561 to 8911, were all found by the Czech mathematician V\u00e1clav \u0160imerka in 1885[8] (thus preceding not just Carmichael but also Korselt, although \u0160imerka did not find anything like Korselt's criterion).[9] His work, however, remained unnoticed. \n  \n J. Chernick[10] proved a theorem in 1939 which can be used to construct a subset of Carmichael numbers. The number ( 6 k + 1 ) ( 12 k + 1 ) ( 18 k + 1 ) {\\displaystyle (6k+1)(12k+1)(18k+1)} is a Carmichael number if its three factors are all prime. Whether this formula produces an infinite quantity of Carmichael numbers is an open question (though it is implied by Dickson's conjecture). \n  \n Paul Erd\u0151s heuristically argued there should be infinitely many Carmichael numbers. In 1994 W. R. (Red) Alford, Andrew Granville and Carl Pomerance used a bound on Olson's constant to show that there really do exist infinitely many Carmichael numbers. Specifically, they showed that for sufficiently large n {\\displaystyle n} , there are at least n 2 / 7 {\\displaystyle n^{2/7}} Carmichael numbers between 1 and n {\\displaystyle n} .[11] \n  \n L\u00f6h and Niebuhr in 1992 found some very large Carmichael numbers, including one with 1,101,518 factors and over 16 million digits. \n  \n Properties [ edit ] \n  \n Factorizations [ edit ] \n  \n Carmichael numbers have at least three positive prime factors. For some fixed R, there are infinitely many Carmichael numbers with exactly R factors; in fact, there are infinitely many such R.[12] \n  \n The first Carmichael numbers with k = 3 , 4 , 5 , \u2026 {\\displaystyle k=3,4,5,\\ldots } prime factors are (sequence A006931 in the OEIS): \n  \n k 3 561 = 3 \u22c5 11 \u22c5 17 {\\displaystyle 561=3\\cdot 11\\cdot 17\\,} 4 41041 = 7 \u22c5 11 \u22c5 13 \u22c5 41 {\\displaystyle 41041=7\\cdot 11\\cdot 13\\cdot 41\\,} 5 825265 = 5 \u22c5 7 \u22c5 17 \u22c5 19 \u22c5 73 {\\displaystyle 825265=5\\cdot 7\\cdot 17\\cdot 19\\cdot 73\\,} 6 321197185 = 5 \u22c5 19 \u22c5 23 \u22c5 29 \u22c5 37 \u22c5 137 {\\displaystyle 321197185=5\\cdot 19\\cdot 23\\cdot 29\\cdot 37\\cdot 137\\,} 7 5394826801 = 7 \u22c5 13 \u22c5 17 \u22c5 23 \u22c5 31 \u22c5 67 \u22c5 73 {\\displaystyle 5394826801=7\\cdot 13\\cdot 17\\cdot 23\\cdot 31\\cdot 67\\cdot 73\\,} 8 232250619601 = 7 \u22c5 11 \u22c5 13 \u22c5 17 \u22c5 31 \u22c5 37 \u22c5 73 \u22c5 163 {\\displaystyle 232250619601=7\\cdot 11\\cdot 13\\cdot 17\\cdot 31\\cdot 37\\cdot 73\\cdot 163\\,} 9 9746347772161 = 7 \u22c5 11 \u22c5 13 \u22c5 17 \u22c5 19 \u22c5 31 \u22c5 37 \u22c5 41 \u22c5 641 {\\displaystyle 9746347772161=7\\cdot 11\\cdot 13\\cdot 17\\cdot 19\\cdot 31\\cdot 37\\cdot 41\\cdot 641\\,} \n  \n The first Carmichael numbers with 4 prime factors are (sequence A074379 in the OEIS): \n  \n i 1 41041 = 7 \u22c5 11 \u22c5 13 \u22c5 41 {\\displaystyle 41041=7\\cdot 11\\cdot 13\\cdot 41\\,} 2 62745 = 3 \u22c5 5 \u22c5 47 \u22c5 89 {\\displaystyle 62745=3\\cdot 5\\cdot 47\\cdot 89\\,} 3 63973 = 7 \u22c5 13 \u22c5 19 \u22c5 37 {\\displaystyle 63973=7\\cdot 13\\cdot 19\\cdot 37\\,} 4 75361 = 11 \u22c5 13 \u22c5 17 \u22c5 31 {\\displaystyle 75361=11\\cdot 13\\cdot 17\\cdot 31\\,} 5 101101 = 7 \u22c5 11 \u22c5 13 \u22c5 101 {\\displaystyle 101101=7\\cdot 11\\cdot 13\\cdot 101\\,} 6 126217 = 7 \u22c5 13 \u22c5 19 \u22c5 73 {\\displaystyle 126217=7\\cdot 13\\cdot 19\\cdot 73\\,} 7 172081 = 7 \u22c5 13 \u22c5 31 \u22c5 61 {\\displaystyle 172081=7\\cdot 13\\cdot 31\\cdot 61\\,} 8 188461 = 7 \u22c5 13 \u22c5 19 \u22c5 109 {\\displaystyle 188461=7\\cdot 13\\cdot 19\\cdot 109\\,} 9 278545 = 5 \u22c5 17 \u22c5 29 \u22c5 113 {\\displaystyle 278545=5\\cdot 17\\cdot 29\\cdot 113\\,} 10 340561 = 13 \u22c5 17 \u22c5 23 \u22c5 67 {\\displaystyle 340561=13\\cdot 17\\cdot 23\\cdot 67\\,} \n  \n The second Carmichael number (1105) can be expressed as the sum of two squares in more ways than any smaller number. The third Carmichael number (1729) is the Hardy-Ramanujan Number: the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes (of positive numbers) in two different ways. \n  \n Distribution [ edit ] \n  \n Let C ( X ) {\\displaystyle C(X)} denote the number of Carmichael numbers less than or equal to X {\\displaystyle X} . The distribution of Carmichael numbers by powers of 10 (sequence A055553 in the OEIS):[4] \n  \n n {\\displaystyle n} 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 C ( 10 n ) {\\displaystyle C(10^{n})} 0 0 1 7 16 43 105 255 646 1547 3605 8241 19279 44706 105212 246683 585355 1401644 3381806 8220777 20138200 \n  \n In 1953, Kn\u00f6del proved the upper bound: \n  \n C ( X ) < X exp \u2061 ( \u2212 k 1 ( log \u2061 X log \u2061 log \u2061 X ) 1 2 ) {\\displaystyle C(X)<X\\exp \\left({-k_{1}\\left(\\log X\\log \\log X\\right)^{\\frac {1}{2}}}\\right)} \n  \n for some constant k 1 {\\displaystyle k_{1}} . \n  \n In 1956, Erd\u0151s improved the bound to[13] \n  \n C ( X ) < X exp \u2061 ( \u2212 k 2 log \u2061 X log \u2061 log \u2061 log \u2061 X log \u2061 log \u2061 X ) {\\displaystyle C(X)<X\\exp \\left({\\frac {-k_{2}\\log X\\log \\log \\log X}{\\log \\log X}}\\right)} \n  \n for some constant k 2 {\\displaystyle k_{2}} . He further gave a heuristic argument suggesting that this upper bound should be close to the true growth rate of C ( X ) {\\displaystyle C(X)} . The table below gives approximate minimal values for the constant k in the Erd\u0151s bound for X = 10 n {\\displaystyle X=10^{n}} as n grows: \n  \n n {\\displaystyle n} 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 21 k 2.19547 1.97946 1.90495 1.86870 1.86377 1.86293 1.86406 1.86522 1.86598 1.86619 \n  \n In the other direction, Alford, Granville and Pomerance proved in 1994[11] that for sufficiently large X, \n  \n C ( X ) > X 2 7 . {\\displaystyle C(X)>X^{\\frac {2}{7}}.} \n  \n In 2005, this bound was further improved by Harman[14] to \n  \n C ( X ) > X 0.332 {\\displaystyle C(X)>X^{0.332}} \n  \n who subsequently improved the exponent to 0.7039 \u22c5 0.4736 = 0.33336704 > 1 / 3 {\\displaystyle 0.7039\\cdot 0.4736=0.33336704>1/3} . [15] \n  \n Regarding the asymptotic distribution of Carmichael numbers, there have been several conjectures. In 1956, Erd\u0151s[13] conjectured that there were X 1 \u2212 o ( 1 ) {\\displaystyle X^{1-o(1)}} Carmichael numbers for X sufficiently large. In 1981, Pomerance[16] sharpened Erd\u0151s' heuristic arguments to conjecture that there are \n  \n X 1 \u2212 { 1 + o ( 1 ) } log \u2061 log \u2061 log \u2061 X log \u2061 log \u2061 X {\\displaystyle X^{1-{\\frac {\\{1+o(1)\\}\\log \\log \\log X}{\\log \\log X}}}} \n  \n Carmichael numbers up to X. However, inside current computational ranges (such as the counts of Carmichael numbers performed by Pinch[4] up to 1021), these conjectures are not yet borne out by the data. \n  \n Generalizations [ edit ] \n  \n The notion of Carmichael number generalizes to a Carmichael ideal in any number field K. For any nonzero prime ideal p {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {p}}} in O K {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {O}}_{K}} , we have \u03b1 N ( p ) \u2261 \u03b1 mod p {\\displaystyle \\alpha ^{{\\rm {N}}({\\mathfrak {p}})}\\equiv \\alpha {\\bmod {\\mathfrak {p}}}} for all \u03b1 {\\displaystyle \\alpha } in O K {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {O}}_{K}} , where N ( p ) {\\displaystyle {\\rm {N}}({\\mathfrak {p}})} is the norm of the ideal p {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {p}}} . (This generalizes Fermat's little theorem, that m p \u2261 m mod p {\\displaystyle m^{p}\\equiv m{\\bmod {p}}} for all integers m when p is prime.) Call a nonzero ideal a {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {a}}} in O K {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {O}}_{K}} Carmichael if it is not a prime ideal and \u03b1 N ( a ) \u2261 \u03b1 mod a {\\displaystyle \\alpha ^{{\\rm {N}}({\\mathfrak {a}})}\\equiv \\alpha {\\bmod {\\mathfrak {a}}}} for all \u03b1 \u2208 O K {\\displaystyle \\alpha \\in {\\mathcal {O}}_{K}} , where N ( a ) {\\displaystyle {\\rm {N}}({\\mathfrak {a}})} is the norm of the ideal a {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {a}}} . When K is Q {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {Q} } , the ideal a {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {a}}} is principal, and if we let a be its positive generator then the ideal a = ( a ) {\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {a}}=(a)} is Carmichael exactly when a is a Carmichael number in the usual sense. \n  \n When K is larger than the rationals it is easy to write down Carmichael ideals in O K {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {O}}_{K}} : for any prime number p that splits completely in K, the principal ideal p O K {\\displaystyle p{\\mathcal {O}}_{K}} is a Carmichael ideal. Since infinitely many prime numbers split completely in any number field, there are infinitely many Carmichael ideals in O K {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {O}}_{K}} . For example, if p is any prime number that is 1 mod 4, the ideal (p) in the Gaussian integers Z[i] is a Carmichael ideal. \n  \n Both prime and Carmichael numbers satisfy the following equality: \n  \n gcd ( \u2211 x = 1 n \u2212 1 x n \u2212 1 , n ) = 1 {\\displaystyle \\gcd \\left(\\sum _{x=1}^{n-1}x^{n-1},n\\right)=1} \n  \n Higher-order Carmichael numbers [ edit ] \n  \n Carmichael numbers can be generalized using concepts of abstract algebra. \n  \n The above definition states that a composite integer n is Carmichael precisely when the nth-power-raising function p n from the ring Z n of integers modulo n to itself is the identity function. The identity is the only Z n -algebra endomorphism on Z n so we can restate the definition as asking that p n be an algebra endomorphism of Z n . As above, p n satisfies the same property whenever n is prime. \n  \n The nth-power-raising function p n is also defined on any Z n -algebra A. A theorem states that n is prime if and only if all such functions p n are algebra endomorphisms. \n  \n In-between these two conditions lies the definition of Carmichael number of order m for any positive integer m as any composite number n such that p n is an endomorphism on every Z n -algebra that can be generated as Z n -module by m elements. Carmichael numbers of order 1 are just the ordinary Carmichael numbers. \n  \n An order 2 Carmichael number [ edit ] \n  \n According to Howe, 17 \u00b7 31 \u00b7 41 \u00b7 43 \u00b7 89 \u00b7 97 \u00b7 167 \u00b7 331 is an order 2 Carmichael number. This product is equal to 443,372,888,629,441.[17] \n  \n Properties [ edit ] \n  \n Korselt's criterion can be generalized to higher-order Carmichael numbers, as shown by Howe. \n  \n A heuristic argument, given in the same paper, appears to suggest that there are infinitely many Carmichael numbers of order m, for any m. However, not a single Carmichael number of order 3 or above is known. \n  \n Notes [ edit ] ||||| Yu Jianchun, who works for a parcel delivery company and has no college degree, has created an alternative method\u2026 https://t.co/Xjvzi1fx1I \u2014 I Do Maths (@idomaths) July 19, 2016 \n  \n In the 1997 drama \u201cGood Will Hunting,\u201d Matt Damon\u2019s character, Will Hunting, is a janitor who solves a complex math problem, finds a British love interest and conquers his existential demons during the course of 126 Oscar-winning minutes. Roger Ebert called it \u201cfairly predictable.\u201d \n  \n Perhaps Ebert would have found reality a little more surprising. A similar narrative, seems to be playing out in China, as CNN reported late Sunday. Yu Jianchun, a 33-year-old package delivery man from China\u2019s Henan province, appears to have untangled a mathematics problem with an efficiency that stunned Chinese experts. \n  \n While the claim has yet to be independently verified, Yu has been heralded as the real-life Will Hunting. Just don\u2019t ask him about the film \u2014 he says he\u2019s never seen it. Nor is the comparison between Damon\u2019s character and Yu perfectly apples-to-apples: Where Hunting was a south Boston roughneck, Yu is reportedly shy and self-effacing, calling himself \u201cslow-witted\u201d in interviews. \n  \n Training at a vocational school before joining the logistics company, Yu has not spent much time in ivory towers. He was a migrant worker, delivering items and stopping at the local university to learn about math when he could. \n  \n \u201cHe has never received any systematic training in number theory nor taken advanced math classes,\u201d Zhejiang University mathematics professor Cai Tianxin told CNN. \u201cAll he has is an instinct and an extreme sensitivity to numbers.\u201d \n  \n To the website Chinatopix, Cai described Yu\u2019s method as \u201ca very imaginative solution.\u201d \n  \n [The newest prime number is more than 22 million digits long] \n  \n Yu\u2019s work involves Carmichael numbers, a set of odd numbers also known as \u201cpseudoprimes.\u201d There are certain mathematical tests, like Fermat\u2019s little theorem, that show if a number is prime. Pseudoprimes, like Carmichael numbers, may at first blush appear to pass some of these tests. But repeated examinations show that Carmichael numbers are not actually prime (the numbers are divisible by other factors than 1 or themselves). \n  \n There are technically an infinite amount of Carmichael numbers, though they occur very infrequently. In 1910, R. D. Carmichael found just 15 of these pseudoprimes, the first five of which are 561, 1105, 1729, 2465 and 2821. Figuring out which numbers are prime and which are Carmichael numbers can be tricky work. In the search for increasingly large prime numbers, it is important to identify which ones are the so-called liar numbers. If this seems like a lot of computational effort to find something you might have learned about in fourth grade, consider that prime numbers are more than a mathematical curiosity \u2014 they power encryption systems like the RSA algorithm used in online shopping. \n  \n \u201cI made my discoveries through intuition,\u201d Yu said to China Daily, a state-backed Chinese newspaper. \u201cI would write down what I thought when inspiration struck about the Carmichael.\u201d \n  \n Pending independent verification of his technique, Yu may have found a way to more easily weed out the Carmichael numbers from the true primes. According to China Daily, Yu worked on his proof for eight years. He reached out to several professors, but Cai was the first to respond to a letter from Yu. \n  \n [There\u2019s a mathematical reason you\u2019re less popular than your friends] \n  \n In June, Cai invited Yu to give a demonstration of his proof at Zhejiang University.

Two of their dogs had been playing with a plastic bag, they told the LAPD. Inside was a human head. \n  \n At some point before the police arrived, a woman posed for pictures with the head. In at least one photo, she is smiling. \n  \n At least, that's what a prominent Hollywood photo agency says. They are trying to sell those pictures. They don't have a buyer, yet, but the asking price is $5000. \n  \n The discovery of the head launched a massive search for the rest of the body or clues about its origins, the Los Angeles Times reported. For two days, LAPD helicopters circled Bronson Canyon Park, hilly home to the city's iconic HOLLYWOOD sign. Crime scene investigators combed the brush; police on horseback fanned out across the terrain. Professional \"cadaver dogs\" took over the task two amateur dogs had started, snuffling through the brush for human remains. \n  \n They found a hand first. \n  \n Then another hand. \n  \n Then two feet. \n  \n According to the Times, the new body parts were not in bags. The LAPD opened a homicide case and theorized that the man had been killed elsewhere, then cut into pieces and dumped in the park. In conversations with the press, police authorities speculated that wild animals could have devoured or moved other remains. \n  \n After the discovery of the victim's feet, I received an email from a representative from a Hollywood photo agency that usually sells paparazzi shots of starlets climbing out of limos. On this day they were peddling pictures of the severed head. Eight pictures, to be exact, \"including a pic of the lady whose dog found the head (and she's smiling),\" the agency said. [Update: Dogwalker denies posing.] For a $5000 fee, Gawker could have a 24-hour web exclusive on the photos. After a day had passed, the agency would be allowed to sell them to other news outlets. \"There's been a lot of interest,\" the representative noted. \n  \n According to the agency, the images originated on the cellphone of \"a guy on the trail who had a phone\u2014the lady didn't have a phone so she asked him to borrow his.\" \n  \n I asked the photo agency how they got into business with this morbid citizen journalist\u2014had he reached out to them?\u2014but the agency refused to give details unless we were willing to pay for those, too. \n  \n We offered $42. They declined. \n  \n And so, with the LAPD still hunting for the deceased man's torso and killer, we joined the hunt for a news outlet willing to pay for the grisly photos. \n  \n \"[W]ouldn't run it. Don't want it,\" said David Perel, executive vice president of RadarOnline. \n  \n New York Post features editor Stephen Lynch bluntly said in an email that their paper would pay \"nothing\" for it. \"Try Brian Williams,\" his message said. \n  \n \"Let me ask. Good quality?\" said New York Daily News gossip columnist Frank DiGiacomo. They were cellphone pictures from the scene of discovery, I told him. He directed me to NYDN's photo editor, who has yet to respond. \n  \n \"We don't buy/use stuff like that,\" said William Bastone, editor of The Smoking Gun, an outlet that published Michael Jackson's autopsy photos. \"I'd be more interested in doing something on the ghoul who tried to get Harvey Levin to (once again) open TMZ's bulging wallet.\" \n  \n TMZ didn't respond to our request for comment. Neither did editors at the National Enquirer, The Daily Mail, or The New York Daily News. \n  \n One person, however, was willing to name a price. \n  \n \"For exclusive images? $3k or more,\" said Fred Mwangaguhunga, founder and editor of Media Takeout. \n  \n We reached out to the LAPD for more information about the case and cellphone photos, but they have not returned our call. We wonder if the LAPD plans to offer a cash reward for clues about the case. By our estimation, $5,001 should do it. \n  \n UPDATE, 4PM EST: The dogwalker has been found. Her name is Lauren Kornberg, and at first she thought the head was a Hollywood prop, and that she didn't pose with the head. \n  \n UPDATE, Jan 20: Kornberg says she didn't pose with the head, but perhaps the hikers who called 911 for her did. \n  \n [Image by Jim Cooke] |||||", "output": "A photo agency that usually sells paparazzi shots is trying to sell photos of the severed head found near the Hollywood sign earlier this week.

Perelson bludgeoned his wife to death with a hammer and attacked his 18-year-old daughter before killing himself \"in a frenzy that he himself likened to a nightmare,\" the Los Angeles Times wrote on Dec. 7, 1959. \n  \n Nancy Sanborn, the realtor of the property, said Tuesday that a couple purchased the home for nearly $2.3 million in a probate sale last month. She did not name the couple, only saying that they really wanted to buy the house. \n  \n As far as the local lore that comes attached to the place, she said, \"It's not a haunted house. It's urban legend that people have been having fun with for years.\" \n  \n \"It's kinda like the alligators in the sewers of New York,\" she said. \n  \n Jeff Maysh, an LA-based journalist who wrote a history of the house on Medium.com and sold the story to an LA production company that plans to make a horror film, was incredulous. \n  \n \"This really demonstrates how nuts the Los Angeles real estate market is right now,\" he said in an email. \"Someone has paid over two million dollars for the city's most notorious private residence, a home that took the crown after the Manson 'murder house' was demolished on Cielo Drive.\" \n  \n The ad on realtor.com listed the 5,050-square-foot Spanish Revival nestled on a hill. It has a grand entrance, step-down living room, ballroom, library and serene views. \n  \n The \"murder house\" has become the center of morbid fascination, sparking ghost hunters to ruminate about it online. \n  \n \"People into weird, creepy stuff would know about it,\" LA history blogger Kim Cooper said. \"There's no justice.

She survived. Two other children, Debbie, 11 and Joel, 13, were not hurt. \n  \n When Debbie woke to the sounds and confronted her father, Perelson told her, \"Go back to bed; this is a nightmare,\" The Times wrote, citing police. \n  \n Nobody knows what set Perelson off, but detectives at the time said they found paperwork suggesting he was having financial problems. \n  \n The dark history of the house took on a life of its own. \n  \n After the Perelsons, another family bought the home in probate in the early 1960s. When they died, the son inherited it from his parents but he didn't live there. The last owner died last year and the home went to probate again. The house went up for sale last week, said Sanborn. \n  \n Some claim they've seen the ghost of Dr. Perelson. \n  \n \"The house is a sinister character in my story,\" said Maysh. \"It's a building that has secrets which kind of gives it a personality. LA is a town based on secrets. Everyone wants to know what's behind closed doors.\" ||||| (Page 2 of 2) \n  \n COLUMN ONE On a Los Feliz hill, murder -- then mystery \n  \n The criminal part of the 1959 case was solved quickly: Dr. Harold Perelson bludgeoned his wife with a ball-peen hammer, then killed himself. The question ever since: Why has the mansion sat empty? \n  \n A year after the murders, in 1960, the mansion was sold in a probate action to a Lincoln Heights couple, Emily and Julian Enriquez. Neighbors remember that the pair visited the house and brought property there to store but didn't move in. \n  \n \"Two nights later the alarm kept going off at my house on my back door. But there was no one there. It was like the ghost was following us.\" \n  \n \"She'd been bitten by a black widow. There was a red vein going up her arm. She had to go to the doctor,\" said Waterson, a clothing company executive. \n  \n The woman pushed open a rear door and walked in, but she didn't get far before a burglar alarm went off. She turned around and left, joking later about \"ghosts\" when she returned to Waterson's home. Soon, her hand was throbbing painfully. \n  \n In time, the place gradually fell into disrepair. Antique light fixtures dating from the 1920s disappeared from the outside. \n  \n Over the years, neighbors say they have helped maintain the property by painting a street-side garage and tidying up the frontyard. They placed a chain across a driveway that leads to the rear of the mansion, giving each nearby resident a key to its lock. \n  \n Several years ago the city required current owner Rudy Enriquez to replace stucco that had peeled from the sides of the house and front walkway walls and to repaint the place, neighbors say. \n  \n \"We had major problems.,\" explained Jude Margolis, a former neighborhood resident who now lives in Hancock Park. \n  \n \"Hookers were coming in. Everybody was bringing guests up there. One night I was sitting outside and I noticed that people were over there having a picnic in the backyard,\" said Margolis, an artist. (The burglar alarm was installed after that.) \n  \n Enriquez inherited the mansion when his mother died in 1994. Since then, he has been approached many times by potential buyers but has steadfastly refused to sell. He tells everyone he hasn't decided what he wants to do with the property. \n  \n \"I asked him why not lease it, at least. You can't have a house sit empty for 50 years and not expect it to fall apart. It's a tear-down now. It's a shame,\" Margolis said. \n  \n Enriquez never invited her into the mansion when he visited it. Another neighbor, Steven Hurley, has never been inside, either. \n  \n \"There are all kinds of stories about the house. Rudy's a very nice man. He's just not interested in doing anything with that house. He's never going to sell it,\" said Hurley, a lighting company sales manager. \n  \n Enriquez, a 77-year-old retired music store manager who lives in the Mount Washington area, said he remains uncertain about his plans. \"I don't know that I want to live there or even stay here,\" he said. He might relocate to Hawaii or Arizona, he added. \n  \n But it has nothing to do with the mansion's violent past. \n  \n \"I've never looked at it as being haunted,\" he said. \"For a time I had two cats inside there and I had to go often to feed them. I still go there often -- I was there last night, in fact. I think now I'll be going more often. \n  \n \"The only spooky thing there is me. Tell people to say their prayers every morning and evening and they'll be OK.\" \n  \n -- \n  \n bob.pool@latimes.com \n  \n -- \n  \n Times researcher Robin Mayper contributed to this story. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Nor had he taken into account the fact that the McItaly was made from products with a protected designation of origin. \n  \n \"With regret,\" wrote Zaia, \"we are forced to deliver bad news to this kind of left: Stalin is dead. And we can safely bet he never set foot in a McDonald's.\" \n  \n He went on: \"On the contrary, this is something that thousands of European youngsters do every day. At the same time, thousands of European farmers are facing the consequences of the worst economic crisis since '29. McItaly will bring to the Italian farmers \u20ac3,448,000 of additional income a month. It will also enable McDonald's clients to eat a healthy burger made with \u2026 Made in Italy products.\" \n  \n Warming to his theme, the minister concluded: \"We hope this will convince them to forget about junk food and choose a healthier and better quality food. We are sure it will work. Then, we will become modern Jesuits and try to 'convert the infidels' of the left, who have never dirtied their hands by working in the fields.\" \n  \n Fort took his depiction as a non-believing, lunatic vestige of \u00adtotalitarianism in good part. \n  \n \"I haven't been so flattered for years,\" he said, pointing out that his original article had prompted Carlo Petrini, the president of the Slow Food movement, to write a similarly despairing piece for La Repubblica. \n  \n \"Clearly this has had international repercussions,\" said Fort, whose last book \u2013 about Sicily, its people and its food \u2013 won the Premio Sicilia Madre Mediterranea, a prize handed out by the Sicilian department of agriculture to honour those who celebrate and support the island's food and traditions. \n  \n \"It's a good knockabout,\" said the writer, \"but I think Zaia rather misses the point and that his attack on pinkoes, fellow travellers and old \u00adStalinists is a distraction from the main issue: the failure of the government to look after Italy's unique legacy of artisanal produce.\" \n  \n It was, he said, \"a depressing reflection of the gap that exists between Italian political life and the lives of Italian citizens\". ||||| If ever there was a sign of the moral bankruptcy of Silvio Berlusconi's government, it is the sight of a McDonald's apron wrapped around the svelte frame of the Minister of Agriculture, Luca Zaia as he helped launch the new McItaly range of burgers. The President of the Council cavorting with young women, the allegations of shady connections, slippery financial arrangements, dubious political allegiances, and all-round dodgy dealings are as nothing when compared to this monstrous act of national betrayal. \n  \n  \n  \n Signor Zaia may make cooing noises \u2013 \"we want to give an imprint of Italian flavours to our youngsters,\" he said as he whipped up one of McDonald's new line of McItaly burgers, a devilish concoction of artichoke spread, Asiago cheese and lettuce, all produced in Italy including the hamburger meat and the bread - but the silence of the lambs would be more appropriate. 'An imprint of Italian flavours'! Did you ever hear such humbug? It is quite clear that Signor Zaia wouldn't let such offensive products near his own mouth unless there was a photo opportunity attached to it. \n  \n  \n  \n An Italian once said to me, \"the trouble for you foreigners is that Italians speak in dialect and eat in dialect.\" It is a problem. Even Italians from different parts of the country can have difficulties understanding each other. But it is also a delight. Italy has enjoyed a food culture of unparalleled richness and diversity. \n  \n For many Italians, their very sense of identity lies in the food, not just of the region in which they were born, but of the town, village, hamlet, even house. And they hold to the superiority of their local produce and dishes with passion. That is why eating your way round Italy is such a continual delight. Pleasure lies in diversity, not homogeneity. Who wants to eat the same stuff the whole world over? It's boring. It's the kind of global mind-numbing sameness and taste bud-mugging mediocrity that McDonald's embodies. No-one in their right mind can see McDonald's as either a force for good in the world or as representing the sunny uplands of gastronomy. \n  \n  \n  \n But there was something more than just political opportunism and commercial public relations in the place where this sad act of betrayal took place, the flagship branch of McDonald's near the Spanish Steps in Rome. It has a symbolic significance. It was the opening of this very branch, let us remind ourselves, that spurred Carlo Petrini and other far-sighted friends, to set up Slow Food to resist the forces of gastro-globalisation and homogenisation, and to celebrate diversity, difference, individuality and quality. It does not bode well for the healthy survival of Italy's extraordinarily diverse food culture that the government should be seen to be embracing its very antithesis with such unbridled enthusiasm. \n  \n  \n  \n But then, perhaps we should not be surprised. The Italian political classes do not have a good record for acting in the best interests of the people. As a Sicilian friend once observed, \"there isn't the same contract between our politicians and the Italian people as exists in the UK\". It could be argued that that doesn't exist now either, but that's another issue. \n  \n  \n  \n 'McDonald's speaks Italian', declares the advertising slogan. It may well do, but it is the corporate Italian of Signor Berlusconi and his ghastly crew of cronies rather than the vast range of regional dialects that most Italians slip into to declare their personal allegiances. We can only hope that the Italians show stiffer resolve than other countries around the world (full statistics are here) which continue to embrace McDonald's in ever more depressing ways. \n  \n \"We will ... try to 'convert the infidels' of the left\".

Enjoy the video first and then go behind-the-scenes with the photos and report below. \n  \n  \n  \n Agents Hines, Purnell, Lathan, and Scordelis \n  \n The New York Public Library approached us about a month ago and asked if we would want to stage an Improv Everywhere mission on their property. The library is facing serious budget cuts, and they thought having us do something awesome there might serve to remind people of how great the NYPL is. We couldn\u2019t say no to the opportunity to do something in their gorgeous, 100 year-old Rose Main Reading Room. \n  \n It actually wasn\u2019t the first time we staged something on the NYPL grounds. Back in 2002, we held a ridiculous protest claiming to be a group called Writers Against Piracy . That mission was, of course, unauthorized. It was nice to get invited by the library this time around and to have their permission to set up our cameras. When brainstorming ideas for the mission, I immediately thought of Ghostbusters. The NYPL is heavily featured in the beginning of the movie, opening with a crane shot of the lion statue outside and cutting to the reading room. The thought of bringing the Ghostbusters back to the library 25 years later cracked me up. \n  \n  \n  \n Agent Lathan and his binocular glasses \n  \n  \n  \n Agent Purnell puts on his fake mustache \n  \n  \n  \n Showing the ghosts a map of the reading room \n  \n We met on the steps out front and got organized. Agent Adams came up with a plan to spread our team of six camera people discreetly around the room. Most of our operators used DSLR cameras, which allowed them to blend in perfectly with the constant stream of tourists taking photos of the historic room. I went over all of the blocking and timing with the actors. They then headed inside to a staging area and got into costume. \n  \n Agent Rodgers was the first ghost to enter. He grabbed a book off of a shelf on the way in and started heading for a seat.

Notice the girl in pink\u2019s reaction (behind the girl in white) \n  \n The first ghost got some nice reactions from the folks he sat by, but they eventually went back to working when it became clear the ghost was just going to sit and read a book. That is, until ghost number two entered. \n  \n  \n  \n Agent Walker enters as the second ghost \n  \n (note the same guard reacting in the background) \n  \n  \n  \n Ghost working in the middle of the crowd \n  \n  \n  \n Closeup of the ghost\u2019s computer screen \n  \n After about five minutes, the final ghost made his entrance.

As The Daily Dot reported, previously witches and other purveyors of the supernatural got away with selling such services as long as they didn\u2019t guarantee results and also offered the buyer a tangible product. You could sell a spell offering (but not guaranteeing) better sex, for instance, if you included actual photos of the spell being cast as part of the purchase. Evidently that\u2019s no longer the case. \n  \n Etsy Where will shoppers turn for their next priapic wand? \n  \n \u201cAny metaphysical service that promises or suggests it will effect a physical change (e.g., weight loss) or other outcome (e.g., love, revenge) is not allowed, even if it delivers a tangible item,\u201d Etsy\u2019s policy reads. \n  \n In response, a small group of witches\u2014no, not a coven\u2014has taken up an online petition to stop what it views as a new ban on its merchants. \n  \n Etsy tells Quartz its policy has always prohibited selling services and that it didn\u2019t change the rules; it just clarified them. \n  \n While the public may chuckle, there is actually a very small, but apparently growing, Pagan and Wiccan population in the US that may or may not identify as witches. In the absence of a local witch outfitter, Etsy offers this group a way to buy and sell their wares to each other and the general public. \n  \n The Etsy petition claims the ban is religious discrimination. \n  \n \u201cThis is discrimination against Pagan and Wiccan faiths, as this ban will target certain sellers and items,\u201d it states. \u201cMany stores have already been closed!\u201d \n  \n Comments left on the petition echoed the sentiment. \u201cI think it\u2019s awful that you are discriminating against the Wiccan, Pagan, and all Metaphysical communities,\u201d wrote one petitioner from California. \u201cAre you going to ban Kabbalah items next?\u201d \n  \n A spokesperson for Etsy, which went public in April, says the reasons for the \u201cclarification\u201d of its policy are twofold: It wants to reiterate that it doesn\u2019t allow services, and it\u2019s trying to \u201dprotect our community from business practices that prey upon vulnerable and desperate shoppers\u2014such as those seeking a treatment for cancer or infertility, or those with self-esteem issues who are seeking a spell for weight loss or beauty enhancement (think penis or breast enlargement).\u201d \n  \n \u201cAt Etsy, we believe in freedom of thought, expression and religion,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWhen we make policy decisions, we strive to strike the right balance between creative freedom, Etsy\u2019s values, and establishing a safe marketplace for members.\u201d \n  \n Etsy isn\u2019t the only marketplace to ban metaphysical goods and services. \n  \n Previously many witches congregated on eBay, until it banned spells, potions, and other products back in 2012. \n  \n But whither to witches, and seekers of their remedies if they can\u2019t sell on Etsy? \n  \n Amazon has been so eager to snap up Etsy merchants that it has dispatched emails inviting them to sell on its new \u201cHandmade\u201d marketplace. In the very least, it would offer more convenience: Your next love potion could delivered to you by drone in thirty minutes or less. ||||| Etsy, the online marketplace for handcrafted goods, has long hosted a thriving community of witches, tarot readers, and other spiritual and supernatural vendors. After eBay banned the sale of spells and the like in 2012, it became one of the most popular places for these types of vendors to make a living. \n  \n But many who sell supernatural goods on the site are claiming Etsy has been on something of a witch hunt (sorry), changing its rules about the sale of metaphysical services and shutting down stores without warning. \n  \n \u201cSwathes of us have now had our sales and shop views tank, and there is great distress in the metaphysical community,\u201d one vendor, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Daily Dot in an email. \n  \n The witch explained that under Etsy\u2019s previous rules, spells and hexes were allowed to be sold, as long as they fit two criteria: They didn\u2019t guarantee results, and they produced something tangible. So you could sell a tarot reading as long as it came with, say, a digital download, or a candle that could be used for casting spells, as long as you didn't guarantee that the spell would actually work. Earlier this year, for instance, I bought a sex spell off Etsy , which came with both photographs of the spell being cast, and a disclaimer that no spell is guaranteed to work. \n  \n Recently, however, Etsy quietly adopted new guidelines that prohibit the sale of spells and hexes. According to its new rules, \u201cany metaphysical service that promises or suggests it will effect a physical change (e.g., weight loss) or other outcome (e.g., love, revenge) is not allowed, even if it delivers a tangible item.\u201d \n  \n Etsy didn't include a date with its new guidelines, so it's unclear when, exactly, the policy change took place. Yet the Daily Dot's source says that Etsy was still enforcing the old rules at the beginning of the month. \u201cUp until June, many sellers had been contacted by Etsy warning them their listings would be deleted and/or shop suspended unless they updated these kinds of things to include something tangible,\" she wrote. \n  \n Even if the witches had a disclaimer saying these services were \u201cfor entertainment purposes only,\u201d or that a spell was not guaranteed to work, listing something as a \u201clove spell\u201d vaguely suggests that you could find love by casting it. \n  \n But instead of warning vendors about the upcoming change, Etsy seems to have pulled the plug overnight. Many vendors say stores began to be shut down last week, and on June 9 our source was sent an email by \u201cEtsy Marketplace Integrity\u201d implying a change had been made. \n  \n \u201cWe\u2019ve recently clarified our spells-related policies in a way that impacts your shop,\u201d the email read. \u201cBecause of this, your shop has been suspended.\u201d \n  \n When asked for comment, Etsy spokesperson Sara Cohen said in an email that the website \u201crecently\u201d updated its policies, though she declined to give an exact date. \n  \n \u201cWhen we make policy decisions, we strive to strike the right balance between creative freedom, Etsy's values, and establishing a safe marketplace for members,\" she wrote. \n  \n Cohen also insisted that Etsy has been contacting affected sellers \u201cto help them make sure items they sell comply with our guidelines.\" She said the website is shutting down only the shops that violate these new policies. \n  \n An Etsy forum on the subject has over 850 responses. Some witches are annoyed that Etsy had given no warning that the site's policies on witchcraft were about to change. Others were frustrated at Etsy for ditching the community that had previously been welcomed on the site with open arms. \n  \n \u201cEtsy has definitely made a lot of money off the sale of these \u2018spelled\u2019 items, so they have had to know they were being sold. They even had a category for Spell listings which would prove that point,\u201d wrote one vendor. \n  \n Screengrab via Jaya Saxena \n  \n Screengrab via Jaya Saxena \n  \n Within Etsy\u2019s witch and metaphysical community, there are a few theories as to why Etsy would have adopted the change. One has to do with Etsy having gone public in April. Additionally, while the site focuses on selling handmade, unique goods, it has always been an easy place for resellers and counterfeiters to set up. Etsy is now facing a lawsuit from investors over items that possibly violate trademarks, and it\u2019s possibly that the website has become more strict about just what can be sold. \n  \n While these theories are all sound, many metaphysical sellers believe that Etsy has a cultural bias against their goods. One forum user compared the sale of crystals that could be used in meditative rituals to the sale of a rosary or a cross. Both items represent spirituality, but neither make the claim that they will heal your ills or help you speak to God. \n  \n \u201cEtsy seems to be only targeting those items of a pagan/occult nature while allowing items of certain faiths traditionally used for protection like St. Christopher medals, to still be marketed,\u201d said another vendor in an email. \u201cPersonally I think it's probably unintended ignorance and failure to consider and think through what banning all spiritual, energetic and magickal claims will really mean.\u201d \n  \n \u201cEtsy seems to be only targeting those items of a pagan/occult nature while allowing items of certain faiths traditionally used for protection, like St. Christopher medals, to still be marketed.\u201d \n  \n Admins in the forums insist that the sales of things like oils, incense, crystals and candles for use in spells are still okay, as long as they don\u2019t claim any magical properties. For many witches, however, that\u2019s not good enough. \n  \n \u201cThe entire point of buying stones/herbs/oils is for their metaphysical effects in my community!,\u201d wrote one vendor. \u201cIf I can't list these correspondences, then why would any witch/pagan buy them from my shop? Witches and Pagans want to buy stones from people with knowledge about their magickal properties.\u201d \n  \n There is already a petition to get Etsy to reopen these shops, with many sellers accusing the website of religious discrimination. \n  \n \u201cI give the example of the seller who just this week was told to change the title of her listing from 'Archangel Protection Spell Kit' to \u2018Archangel Protection PRAYER Kit\u2019 by an Etsy rep,\u201d claimed one vendor. \u201cA spell and a prayer are basically the same thing, putting an intention out into the Universe.\u201d \n  \n Discrimination or not, if you\u2019re looking to hex your ex-girlfriend, you\u2019ll have to start looking elsewhere.

But now that's not even enough, according to the new guidelines: \"Any metaphysical service that promises or suggests it will effect a physical change (e.g., weight loss) or other outcome (e.g., love, revenge) is not allowed, even if it delivers a tangible item.\" The pagan and Wiccan community is claiming cultural and even religious bias, pointing to the continued sale of more-traditional prayer items such as rosaries and crosses on Etsy. \"I give the example of the seller who just this week was told to change the title of her listing from 'Archangel Protection Spell Kit' to 'Archangel Protection PRAYER Kit' by an Etsy rep,\" one vendor says. \"A spell and a prayer are basically the same thing, putting an intention out into the Universe.\" Etsy, meanwhile, responds that it simply wishes to clarify that it's not in the business of selling services, and wants to \"protect our community from business practices that prey upon vulnerable and desperate shoppers\u2014such as those seeking a treatment for cancer or infertility.\" Amazon, meanwhile, is more than happy to take the new merchants, reports Quartz.

Medics verified that the passenger did not have a fever \u2013 a key early symptom of Ebola. \n  \n While airport officials would not identify the passenger, a video taken from the plane and posted online shows emergency personnel escorting an African-American man off the flight as the rest of the plane watches. \n  \n In the video, he is heard saying, \u201cI ain\u2019t from Africa.\u201d \n  \n Reports from local press said the man appeared to be \u201cunbalanced,\u201d although officials would not elaborate on what that meant. \n  \n Paola Rainieri, vice president of marketing and communications for Grupo Punta Cana, which owns the airport, told FNL that the airplane was held on the tarmac for nearly two hours until medical and airline officials determined there was no risk to the 200-plus passengers. \n  \n Reached for comment, a US Airways representative confirmed the incident, saying in a statement that the flight was cleared by local authorities. \n  \n \"We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused, but the safety of our customers and crews is our main priority,\" the statement said. \n  \n Rainieri described the incident as a \u201cjoke of poor taste\u201d by the passenger, who had not traveled to Africa recently. According to Rainieri, the man's passport showed that the last trip he had taken anywhere close to Africa was a 2012 trip to Europe. \n  \n \u201cWe don\u2019t know why he did it, but he thought it would be a cute joke that would not be so serious,\u201d she said. \u201cThankfully it was only a scare.\u201d \n  \n Rainieri said that while the incident did not end up as being serious as it might have been, airport officials took all precautions. She said they have medic teams on hand for such situations, and this incident proved to them that they are prepared. \n  \n She added that several days ago, with the increased threat of Ebola spreading internationally, airport and immigration officials added precautionary steps for travelers \u2013 including a questionnaire asking if they have traveled to Africa recently, and if they have any of the symptoms of the disease. \n  \n \u201cWe have to be responsible,\u201d Rainieri said. \u201cAs an airport, we are ready for anything.\u201d \n  \n She said the passenger had filled out the questionnaire and noted that he had not been to Africa lately. \n  \n \u201cIncidents like these affect the country, it affects people on the island,\u201d Rainieri said when asked about the event's potential affect on tourism. \u201cIt scares passengers and would make them not travel to the Dominican Republic.\u201d \n  \n Arturo Villanueva, vice president of the Hotel and Tourism Association of the Dominican Republic (ASONAHORES), agreed with Rainieri. \n  \n \u201cWe have to think about the country and about the population,\u201d he told FNL. \u201cEbola has become an international problem.

Charles Manson (born November 12, 1934) was an American criminal who spearheaded a murderous campaign with his followers, the Manson Family cult, that would make him one of the most infamous figures in criminal history. Notoriously connected to the brutal slayings of actress Sharon Tate and other Hollywood residents, Manson received the death penalty in 1971, a sentence that was commuted to life in prison the following year. Is Charles Manson Dead or Alive? Charles Manson died on November 19, 2017, of natural causes. Days earlier, he had been admitted to a hospital in Bakersfield, California; however, no details about his medical condition or his location were disclosed, due to privacy and security reasons. The longtime prisoner had also been hospitalized earlier in the year. ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website He had been serving time in Corcoran State Prison in California since 1971. In 2012 Manson was denied parole for the 12th time. \n  \n The Manson Family Cult \"The Family,\" as they became known, was a group of around 100 followers of Charles Manson who shared his passion for an unconventional lifestyle and habitual use of hallucinogenic drugs, such as LSD and magic mushrooms. After Manson was released from prison for petty crimes in 1967, the Manson Family moved to San Francisco and later to a deserted ranch in the San Fernando Valley. Manson\u2019s followers also included a small, hard-core unit of impressionable young girls. They began to believe, without question, Manson's claims that he was Jesus and his prophecies of a race war. ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website Manson Murders The Manson Family \u2014 including Charles Manson and his young, loyal disciples \u2014 is thought to have carried out some 35 killings. Most of their cases were never tried, either for lack of evidence or because the perpetrators were already sentenced to life for the Tate/La Bianca killings. The first of Manson\u2019s victims was murdered on August 9, 1969, at the home Roman Polanski had rented, located at 10050 Cielo Drive in Benedict Canyon, an area just north of Beverly Hills. While Manson himself took no part in the actual killings, he directed four of his most obedient followers \u2014 Charles \"Tex\" Watson, Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Linda Kasabian \u2014 to the address and directed them to kill everyone. According to one of the Family member's statements, the Polanski household had been targeted because it represented the showbiz world that had rejected Manson. The four victims found inside the Polanski residence had just returned home from dinner at the time of the murder: Polanski\u2019s wife, actress Sharon Tate; writer Wojciech Frykowski and his partner; the coffee bean heiress Abigail Folger; and celebrity hairstylist Jay Sebring. Polanski himself was away in London shooting a film. Steven Parent, an 18-year-old who took care of and lived in a guest home on the Cielo Drive property that Polanski and Tate rented, had been visiting his friend William Garretson when he became the Manson Family\u2019s first victim. As he drove away from the house in the dark early morning hours, he was spotted by the intruders and shot dead. Kasabian was horrified by the shooting of the boy, and she remained outside to keep watch. Kasabian acted as the getaway driver and was to become the star witness during the trial. When the other three broke into the house, they herded the occupants into the living room and tied them up. Jay Sebring was shot and brutally kicked as he tried to defend Ms. Tate. During the terrifying murder spree, both Frykowski and Folger managed to escape from the house but were chased and stabbed to death. At the trial, Kasabian described how she saw Frykowski staggering out of the house covered in blood and was horrified at the sight. She told him she was \"sorry,\" but despite her pleas to his attacker to stop, the victim was bludgeoned repeatedly. Folger escaped from the house with terrible injuries but was caught on the front lawn and stabbed 28 times. Eight-months-pregnant Sharon Tate, who, despite pleading for the life of her unborn child, was mercilessly stabbed in the stomach by Susan Atkins. Kasabian told of Atkins's chilling words to Tate before she stabbed her: \"Look, bitch, I have no mercy for you. You're going to die, and you'd better get used to it.\" Atkins then used Tate's blood to write the word \"pig\" on the front door. However, instead of this brutal massacre sating the pathological Manson, he criticized the murderers for being sloppy. READ ARTICLE: \"Sharon Tate's Sister Remembers Her Beautiful Life (PHOTOS)\" The following night, on August 10, 1969, Manson took Family members Watson, Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten to the Los Feliz address of wealthy supermarket executive Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary, and the couple was murdered in a similarly horrifying fashion. Charles Manson Movie In early 2018, it was announced that a movie about the infamous Manson murders was in the works, with The Crown's Matt Smith tapped to star as the cult leader. Titled Charlie Says, the film will reportedly focus on the women who fell under the sway of Manson until being forced to account for their actions while incarcerated, drawing from the books The Family (1971) and The Long Prison Journey of Leslie Van Houten (2001) as source material. Charles Manson\u2019s Wives and Children In 1955, between prison sentences, Charles Manson married a 17-year-old hospital waitress, Rosalie Jean Willis. The couple moved to California and had a son, Charles Manson Jr., who committed suicide in the 1990s. By 1956, Willis had left with their child to be with her new lover, and she later divorced Manson. In 1959, Manson married a prostitute, Leona Rae \u201cCandy\u201d Stevens, with whom he had a second son, Charles Luther Manson; Stevens divorced Manson in 1963. In a 2013 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, a woman named Afton Burton, who called herself Star, claimed that she and Manson were in a relationship, telling the reporter: \"I'll tell you straight up, Charlie and I are going to get married. When that will be, we don't know. But I take it very seriously. Charlie is my husband. Charlie told me to tell you this.\" At the age of 19, Star had moved from Illinois to Corcoran, California, to be near the prison where Manson was incarcerated, and she also ran multiple websites aimed at securing his release. In November 2014, the 26-year-old Star and 80-year-old Manson obtained a marriage license. However, their marriage license expired in 2015, and allegations were made in February of that year by writer Daniel Simone that Star primarily intended to marry Manson so she could publicly display his corpse for profit after his death. Star later told Inside Edition the nuptials were still on, while her mother disputed Simone's claims in a Rolling Stone story. Posthumous Legal Battles For around four months after Manson's death, the Kern County Superior Court of California sought to determine who had the right to claim the notorious cult leader's body. Four people expressed interest, including two who claimed to be his son, one who demonstrated he was a grandson and a fourth who said he was a longtime pen pal. The matter was further complicated by the submission of competing wills. In March 2018, the court awarded Manson's body to his grandson, Jason Freeman, the only child of Charles Manson Jr. A resident of Bradenton, Florida, Freeman told a local news channel he planned to cremate his grandfather's body and scatter the ashes in an undisclosed location. \n  \n Childhood and Early Life Charles Manson was born Charles Milles Maddox on November 12, 1934, in Cincinnati, Ohio, to Kathleen Maddox, a 16-year-old girl who was both an alcoholic and a prostitute. Kathleen later married William Manson, but the marriage ended quickly and Charles was placed in a boys school. Rejected in his attempts to return to his mother, Charles was soon living on the streets and getting by through petty crime. Still just a teenager, in 1951 Manson began spending time in prison. Early on, before he discovered the benefits of being a \"model prisoner,\" he was considered dangerous. He would eventually spend half of the first 32 years of his life behind bars. Manson was described by probation reports as suffering from a \"marked degree of rejection, instability and psychic trauma\" and \"constantly striving for status and securing some kind of love.\" Other descriptions included \"unpredictable\" and \"safe only under supervision.\" From 1958, Manson was in and out of jail for a variety of offenses, including pimping and passing stolen checks, and he was sent to McNeil Island prison in Washington State for 10 years. It was while he was incarcerated that Manson learned how to read music and play the guitar. 'Helter Skelter' Manson was also influenced not only by drugs, such as LSD, but by art works and music of the time, most notably The Beatles song \"Helter Skelter,\" from their White Album. He had a strong belief and interest in the notion of Armageddon from the Book of Revelations, and also explored the teachings of Scientology and more obscure cult churches, such as the Church of the Final Judgment. In many ways, Manson reflected personality traits and obsessions that were associated with gurus of cult-quasi-religious groups that began to emerge in the 1960s. He was pathologically deluded into believing that he was the harbinger of doom regarding the planet's future. Manson was released from prison on March 21, 1967. In August 1969, Manson gathered a group of his most loyal Family followers to carry out his massacre among Hollywood's elite and \"beautiful people.\" Manson\u2019s Arrest and Trial Ironically, Manson and his Family were arrested not on suspicion of the Tate/LaBianca murders, but simply on the belief that they had vandalized a portion of the Death Valley National Park while they were hiding out in the Mojave Desert. In 1969, the county sheriff had taken them into custody, not realizing that they were involved in the heinous murders. But it was through the confession of Susan Atkins, while held in detention on suspicion of murdering Gary Hinman during an unrelated incident, that led detectives to realize that Manson and his followers were involved in the killings. Various motivations were examined during the course of the trial. The most feasible was that Manson's pathological ego, insanity and belief in Armageddon were influences that led him to leave behind a trail of destruction. Manson believed that he was the new Messiah, and that after a \"nuclear attack\" he and his followers would be saved by hiding in a secret world under the desert. His prophetic visions included a belief that the race war would result in a black victory, and Manson along with his Family members would have to mentor the black community, as they would lack experience to run the planet. As Manson and the Family were to be the beneficiaries of the race war, he told his followers that they had to help initiate it. According to defense witness and killer Van Houten, this was the primary reason why they murdered the LaBiancas. Manson had taken the wallet of murdered Rosemary LaBianca with the intention that he would deposit it in a section of L.A. where an African American might find it, use it and then possibly have the murders pinned on them. Later in court, Van Houten, who was just 19 when she took part in the LaBianca killings, alleged that Manson had taken advantage of her vulnerability and dislike for her mother, although she believed, like the other members, that he was a man of vision. Thirty years later, during a parole board hearing, Van Houten said she was horrified by what she had done that night and desperately wanted to redeem herself. She was denied parole in 2006 and again in 2010. Susan Atkins admitted in initial confessions to fellow prisoners that she had wanted to cut out Tate's unborn baby but didn't have the time. She also revealed that other grisly and macabre acts were to be perpetrated against the victims and that a list of other high-profile Hollywood stars were on a list to be killed and mutilated. These included Elizabeth Taylor and husband Richard Burton, Frank Sinatra, Steve McQueen and Tom Jones. When asked why they wanted to kill celebrities, Atkins replied that the Manson Family wanted to commit murders that would shock the world and make people take notice. The trial began in June 1970, with lawyer Ronald Hughes named the attorney for Manson and Van Houten. Hughes soon dropped Manson as a client, reportedly because he felt he could convince the jury that Van Houten had been unduly influenced the Family leader. The move may have cost him his life: Late in the year, Hughes went camping and disappeared, and his decomposed body turned up several months later. It is thought that he was the victim of a retaliation killing by members of Manson's Family. During the trial, Manson released an album titled Lie in an effort to raise money for his defense. He reveled in the media attention, and during court proceedings he turned up with an X carved into his forehead. Some of his female followers copied the act and shaved their heads, sometimes sitting outside the courthouse. The X was gradually modified until it turned into a swastika. Throughout the trial, the killers often giggled and exchanged grimaces with Manson, showing no remorse for their crimes. On January 25, 1971, Manson was convicted of first-degree murder for directing the deaths of the Tate/LaBianca victims. He was sentenced to death, but this was automatically commuted to life in prison after California's Supreme Court invalidated all death sentences prior to 1972. Kasabian was granted immunity for her part as star witness. Susan Atkins was sentenced to death, but her sentence was later commuted to life in prison. She was incarcerated from 1969 until her death in 2009. The Manson-Beach Boys Connection Before the murderous spree, Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys had allowed Manson and several members of his Family to stay at his home after picking up two female members of the Family who had been hitchhiking. It was through this association that Manson got the opportunity to audition for Terry Melcher, son of and friend/producer of the popular 1960s band the Beach Boys, who was living at Polanski's house at the time. Melcher wasn't interested in signing a contract with Manson. However, Manson allegedly did record some music at Dennis's brother Brian Wilson's home studio. The Beach Boys released a song written by Manson entitled \"Cease to Exist\" (renamed \"Never Learn Not to Love\") on their 1969 album, 20/20, as a single B-side. ||||| Manson and members of his \"family\" of followers were convicted of killing actress Sharon Tate and six other people during a bloody rampage in the Los Angeles area in August 1969. Prosecutors said Manson and his followers were trying to incite a race war he dubbed \"Helter Skelter,\" taken from the Beatles song of the same name. |||||", "output": "All that California corrections officials will confirm is that Charles Manson is alive\u2014but all other details on why the 83-year-old mass murderer is now at a hospital in Bakersfield, Calif., are being kept under wraps, per the Los Angeles Times.

Until then, he will continue to ably lead our coalition forces in Afghanistan. \n  \n General David Petraeus is expected to leave his post as commander of United States troops in Afghanistan, the Times Of London reports early Tuesday evening. \n  \n The Washington Post reported earlier in the day: \n  \n No final decisions have been made, but military officials said that Petraeus, who took command last July, will rotate out of Afghanistan before the end of the year. The general who replaces Petraeus will have to navigate a tricky relationship with Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Pakistani leaders... \n  \n According to the Times, the Pentagon is expected to name a replacement for Petraeus by the end of the year. \n  \n President Barack Obama tapped Petraeus to replace Gen.

(Associated Press) \n  \n People watch as two climbers vying to become the first in the world to use only their hands and feet to scale a sheer slab of granite and make their way to the summit of El Capitan Wednesday, Jan. 14,... (Associated Press) \n  \n Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson became the first to \"free-climb\" the rock formation's Dawn Wall, a feat that many had considered impossible. They used ropes and safety harnesses to catch them in case of a fall, but relied entirely on their own strength and dexterity to ascend by grasping cracks as thin as razor blades and as small as dimes. \n  \n The effort took weeks, as the two dealt with constant falls and injuries. But their success completes a years-long dream that bordered on obsession for the men. \n  \n The trek up the world's largest granite monolith began Dec. 27. Caldwell and Jorgeson lived on the wall itself. They ate and slept in tents fastened to the rock thousands of feet above the ground and battled painful cuts to their fingertips much of the way. \n  \n Free-climbers do not pull themselves up with cables or use chisels to carve out handholds. Instead, they climb inch by inch, wedging their fingertips and feet into tiny crevices or gripping sharp, thin projections of rock. In photographs, the two appeared at times like Spider-Man, with arms and legs splayed across the pale rock that has been described as smooth as a bedroom wall. \n  \n Both men needed to take rest days to wait for their skin to heal. They used tape and even superglue to help with the process. At one point, Caldwell set an alarm to wake him every few hours to apply a special lotion to his throbbing hands. \n  \n They also took physical punishment when their grip would slip, pitching them into long, swinging falls that left them bouncing off the rock face. The tumbles, which they called \"taking a whipper,\" ended in startling jolts from their safety ropes. \n  \n Caldwell and Jorgeson had help from a team of supporters who brought food and supplies and shot video of the adventure. \n  \n The 36-year-old Caldwell and 30-year-old Jorgeson ate canned peaches and occasionally sipped whiskey. They watched their urine evaporate into thin, dry air and handed toilet sacks, called \"wag bags,\" to helpers who disposed of them. \n  \n There are about 100 routes up the rock known among climbers as \"El Cap,\" and many have made it to the top, the first in 1958. Even the Dawn Wall had been scaled. Warren Harding and Dean Caldwell (no relation to Tommy) made it up in 1970, using climbing ropes and countless rivets over 27 days. \n  \n No one, however, had ever made it to the 3,000-foot summit in one continuous free-climb \u2014 until now. \n  \n The pioneering ascent comes as a result of five years of training and failed attempts for both Caldwell and Jorgeson. They only got about a third of the way up in 2010 when they were turned back by storms. A year later, Jorgeson fell and broke an ankle in another attempt. Since then, each has spent time on the big, blank rock practicing and mapping out strategy. \n  \n On this try, as the world watched and followed on Facebook and Twitter, Jorgeson was stalled by a lower section that took 11 attempts over the course of seven days. \n  \n \"As disappointing as this is, I'm learning new levels of patience, perseverance and desire,\" Jorgeson posted online. \"I'm not giving up. I will rest. I will try again. I will succeed.\" \n  \n Caldwell, of Estes Park, Colorado, is no stranger to El Cap. He has free-climbed 11 different routes and was the first to make such ascents of the Dihedral Wall and West Buttress. He was the third to free-climb the Nose on El Cap. He also made his way up a challenging El Capitan route in fewer than 24 hours \u2014 becoming only the second person to do so \u2014 only months after accidentally severing his left index finger with a table saw in 2001. \n  \n In 2000, Caldwell and three other climbers went to the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan to scale the towering rock walls of its southern mountains. Seventeen days in, they were captured by the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. Caldwell shoved a guard over a cliff, and the climbers fled, eventually reaching a Kyrgyz army outpost. The guard survived the fall. \n  \n Jorgeson, of Santa Rosa, California, has an impressive list of climbs in the U.S., Europe and South Africa. He works as a climbing instructor and co-founded an advocacy group for the climbers. \n  \n Still, the difficulty of the climb wasn't a surprise. \n  \n John Long, the first person to climb up El Capitan in one day in 1975, said recently of Caldwell and Jorgeson's free-climb that it was almost \"inconceivable that anyone could do something that continuously difficult.\" ||||| Andrew Bisharat \n  \n for National Geographic \n  \n Published January 15, 2015 \n  \n Updated at 11:20 a.m. EST on January 15 \n  \n Nineteen days after they set out to achieve one of climbing's most difficult challenges, Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson reached the summit of the 3,000-foot rock known as El Capitan in Yosemite National Park on Wednesday, marking the first free ascent of a notoriously difficult section called the Dawn Wall. \n  \n Caldwell and Jorgeson reached the summit just after 6:00 p.m. EST, where a contingent of 40 friends and family members, plus a group of reporters, stood ready to greet them, having arrived via an eight-mile (13-kilometer) hike around the backside of the mountain. \n  \n NG MAPS; CLAY WADMAN; ALDO CHIAPPE \n  \n The crowd had already begun toasting the duo's accomplishment with champagne. (See pictures from the photographer who is documenting Caldwell's and Jorgeson's attempt to make history.) \n  \n The ascent represents the realization of Caldwell's vision to find a way to free climb the Dawn Wall\u2014widely considered too steep and lacking enough cracks or seams in the rock for free climbing\u2014a dream that began seven years ago, when Caldwell began exploring this historic granite face. \n  \n \"This is not an effort to 'conquer,'\" Jorgeson said Tuesday on Twitter, from 2,000 feet (610 meters) up the side of El Capitan. \"It's about realizing a dream.\" (Read why Caldwell and Jorgeson are sanding and Super Gluing their fingers for the climb.) \n  \n Photograph by Bligh Gillies, Big Up Productions \n  \n From the start, two and a half weeks ago, the climbing world has been charting their progress. But as the pair moved up the wall and first Caldwell and then Jorgeson successfully made it past the most difficult sections, a much broader, global audience became captivated by the imagery of two men clinging to the most improbable-looking surface of rock by the very tips of their fingers, thousands of feet above the ground. \n  \n Free climbing means using one's hands and feet to ascend a rock's natural features, employing ropes and other gear only to stop a fall. At roughly 3,000 feet (915 meters) tall, the Dawn Wall comprises 32 \"pitches\"\u2014or 32 rope-lengths\u2014of climbing. \n  \n Caldwell's and Jorgeson's goal was to free climb all 32 pitches\u2014without falling and without returning to the ground in between. If one of them fell while attempting a pitch, he would have to try that individual pitch from its beginning again. (Read about Jorgeson's attempts to catch up to Caldwell.) \n  \n They began their ascent on December 27, and committed to living up on the side of El Cap for as long as it took each of them to free climb every pitch in succession. Their base camp consisted of three portaledges\u2014each one a six-foot by four-foot (2-meter by 1-meter) platform with tent fly, suspended by nylon straps and hanging from bolts in the sheer granite wall. For breakfast they ate whole-wheat bagels topped with cream cheese, red bell pepper, cucumber, and salami or salmon. At night, they sipped whiskey. Every few days, one of the friends waiting on the ground ascended 1,200 feet (366 meters) of rope to bring the team a new cache of supplies and water. \n  \n Over the first six days, they made quick work of the initial 14 pitches\u2014some of the hardest pitches of all. During their five previous attempts at the Dawn Wall, spread out over as many years, they had never even made it past pitch 12. When they both accomplished pitch 14 on January 1, it seemed as though the duo stood a real chance of success. (Read National Geographic's adventure blog, Beyond the Edge.) \n  \n Video courtesy: Adidas Outdoor \n  \n Breaking Through \n  \n After pitch 14, Caldwell, 36, the more experienced climber of the two, kicked into high gear. He continued to complete grueling pitch after grueling pitch over the next seven days. After two weeks on the wall, Caldwell had free climbed the first 20 pitches, beyond which only easier sections remained. \n  \n Jorgeson, 30, meanwhile, stalled out on pitch 15. For ten days in a row, he continued to fall during each of his attempts. Time was a factor\u2014the longer the climbers were on the wall, the greater chance of a weather front moving through and forcing the climbers to descend. The chance for success was literally slipping through Jorgeson's bandaged and bloody fingertips, and he was painfully aware that he was holding his partner back. If he didn't do pitch 15 soon, Caldwell would have to decide whether to move on alone. \n  \n \"More than anything, I want to top out together,\" Caldwell said on day 13. \"We gotta make that happen. It would be such a bummer to finish this thing without Kevin. I can't imagine anything worse, really.\" \n  \n Photograph by Corey Rich, Big Up Productions \n  \n On January 9, Jorgeson finally broke through and completed pitch 15 without falling. The success reenergized the team in a major way, as Jorgeson caught a second wind. He describes experiencing a profound \"resolve\" to match his partner's high point, at the top of pitch 20. He started to climb as if a fire had been lit within. \n  \n \"After 11 attempts spread across 7 days, my battle with Pitch 15 of the Dawn Wall is complete,\" Jorgeson wrote on Instagram. \"Hard to put the feeling into words. There's a lot of hard climbing above, but I'm more resolved than ever to free the remaining pitches.\" \n  \n By Monday, both Caldwell and Jorgeson had reached a ledge dubbed Wino Tower. Below them was 2,000 feet (610 meters) of the hardest free climbing ever completed on El Capitan. Over the the next two days, the climbers continued the remainder of their ascent\u2014a stroll compared to what they had already been through. \n  \n Photograph by Corey Rich, Big Up Productions \n  \n El Cap: America's Biggest Rock \n  \n The Dawn Wall is the steepest, tallest, blankest section of El Cap\u2014and one of the monolith's most storied sectors. \n  \n Warren Harding and Dean Caldwell (no relation to Tommy) aid climbed the \"Wall of the Early Morning Light,\" aka the Dawn Wall, for the first time in 1970. Aid climbing involves standing on nylon ladders that are clipped to pieces of gear attached to the wall. \n  \n Harding's and Caldwell's ascent became the subject of national news when, after 22 days of living on the wall\u2014sleeping in hammocks and drinking numerous bottles of wine\u2014a four-day storm blew in, and the two climbers famously turned down the National Park Service's attempt to rescue them. \n  \n In 1970, simply trying to reach the summit of El Capitan, by any means, was considered a worthy goal. Climbing techniques, equipment, and levels of skill were still quite rudimentary compared to today. In 1970, for example, no one would've ever believed that El Capitan could be free climbed. \n  \n Now, in a strange twist, the Dawn Wall has returned to the spotlight under very different circumstances. For Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson, the adventure lies not in just getting to the top of the great granite monolith. The challenge is seeing if they can do it all free. \n  \n Photograph by Jimmy Chin, National Geographic Creative \n  \n Logistics of Going Free \n  \n In every way the performance of these two climbers has been a giant production. An intricate web of rigged ropes allowed the climbers to move from pitch to pitch, as they worked on free climbing each one in succession. The ropes also provided a way for a small camera crew to document their efforts. A line to the ground allowed friends to provide the climbers with supplies, water, and food. \n  \n Free climbing is much more athletic than aid climbing. Free climbing does not mean climbing with no ropes\u2014that's free soloing, a highly risky style of climbing practiced only on occasion by relatively few in the climbing world. \n  \n Still, it's an arduous process, requiring a climber to use only the natural features of the rock to advance\u2014cracks in which to wedge one's hands and edges to curl one's fingertips over. \n  \n The climbers wear harnesses and are each tied to one end of a 200-foot-long rope (61 meters), which is clipped, via carabiners, to various types of climbing gear, from camming units that fit in cracks to expansion bolts that have been pre-drilled into the rock. They only rely on this equipment to catch them if they fall. \n  \n Free climbs are puzzles. On any given pitch, a climber faces a series of holds that vary in size, shape, and distance from each other. The goal is figuring out how to move between this unique combination of holds. The harder the movements get\u2014twisting, stretching, lunging, swinging, dangling\u2014the more painstaking the process of solving the puzzle becomes. \n  \n Photograph by Brett Lowell, Big Up Productionse \n  \n Ballet on the Rock \n  \n Climbers fall, hang, and rehearse each and every move, over and over. They memorize sequences. They scrub the rock with toothbrushes to remove any dust or dirt and improve the texture and friction on the hold. They place \"tick marks,\" white chalk marks, to indicate the location of hard-to-see hand- and footholds. \n  \n Another important aspect of free climbing is for climbers to manage the lactic acid building up in their forearms\u2014by holding on with no more than the precise minimum amount of energy needed to keep attached to the wall. \n  \n Distributing body weight among hands and feet, and maintaining a perfect balance among these constantly moving appendages, is yet another crucial element. \n  \n Of course, it helps to have fingers as strong as vice grips, iron core muscles, the flexibility of a yoga master, and virtually no body fat. \n  \n When a climber falls, his partner catches the fall using a belay device, which acts like a brake and stops the rope. As long as no one is injured, it's no big deal. The climber simply tries again until successful. \n  \n With the hardest routes in the world, however, that success sometimes takes weeks, months, or even years of practice and training. Even with all that work, skin conditions, humidity, air temperature, a calm and unattached state of mind, and a well-rested body also all need to align. \n  \n About the troublesome pitch 15, for example, Jorgeson said, \"The conditions were just magic. It was the one moment over the last ten days when it was actually cloudy and cold enough to climb during daylight. It all lined up to create this one moment in which my skin was good enough and the conditions were perfect.\" \n  \n What makes the Dawn Wall so significant is that it contains so many hard free-climbing pitches in a row. There are about 13 other free climbs on El Cap, and none of them are even close to being as challenging. Those other routes might have one or two extremely difficult pitches total. The Dawn Wall has about 17. Two of them, pitches 14 and 15, are the most difficult in Yosemite and at the upper limit of what has been achieved in rock climbing anywhere. \n  \n The idea that anyone would be able to free climb at such a high level, day after day, while living out of a tiny portaledge the size of a twin mattress, seemed far-fetched if not downright impossible. Even for Tommy Caldwell. \n  \n Photograph by Jimmy Chin, National Geographic Creative \n  \n \"Clumsy Kid With Bad Hand-Eye Coordination\" \n  \n If anyone was to pull off this unlikely challenge, Tommy Caldwell, of Estes Park, Colorado, was a good bet. \n  \n He started climbing at just three years old and became a national climbing champion at 16 when, on a whim, he entered a sport climbing competition and won, beating some of the nation's top pro climbers. Since then, he has dedicated most of his professional climbing career to exploring the nuances of the many climbing routes crisscrossing El Capitan's towering granite flanks. \n  \n \"I grew up a clumsy kid with bad hand-eye coordination,\" wrote Caldwell in Ascent magazine. \"Yet here on El Cap I felt as though I had stumbled into a world where I thrived. Being up on those steep walls demanded the right amount of climbing skill, pain tolerance, and sheer bull-headedness that came naturally to me.\" \n  \n Caldwell free climbed his first El Cap route in 1999, and he has returned to the monolith every year since to find new challenges. He is routinely described as an \"all-around\" climber due to the fact that he consistently performs at world-class levels in each of climbing's various genres, from bouldering to sport climbing to mountaineering\u2014distinct disciplines that demand very specialized skill sets. To understand the breadth of Caldwell's athleticism, picture an Olympic runner who is as talented in the marathon as he is in the hundred-meter dash. \n  \n Here on El Cap I felt as though I had stumbled into a world where I thrived. \n  \n It's worth noting that Caldwell has managed to achieve all this success despite missing a finger. In 2001 while working with a table saw, he accidentally cut off his left index finger\u2014a debilitating loss when your life's passion involves hanging by your fingertips. \n  \n Doctors were able to reattach the finger, but told Caldwell that with its diminished mobility he'd never climb again. At first he was devastated, but then his determination kicked in, and he had the finger removed so as not to hinder him. Five months later, he free climbed the 3,000-foot (914-meter) Salath\u00e9 Wall, another route on El Capitan, in less than 24 hours. \n  \n He faced another grave moment the following year during an expedition to Kyrgyzstan with fellow climbers John Dickey, Jason Smith, and Beth Rodden, who was then Caldwell's girlfriend and later became his wife. In the Aksu Valley, the four climbers were taken captive by militant rebels of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. Over the next six days, they were held at gunpoint and marched at night through the mountains while their captors traded fire with the Kyrgyz army. \n  \n The defining moment of their kidnapping came when the four climbers found themselves alone with just one rebel fighter, and Caldwell shoved the gunman off a cliff. They escaped, hiking 18 miles (29 kilometers) to freedom. \n  \n Caldwell was distraught over what he thought he'd done. Yet in a bizarre twist, a week later word emerged from Kyrgyzstan that the rebel Caldwell had shoved had actually survived, having only tumbled down a steep hill. \n  \n Photograph by Jimmy Chin, National Geographic Creative \n  \n Beginning the Dawn Wall \n  \n About 100 climbs zig-zag up the face of El Capitan, but only 13 of those routes have been free climbed. In 1988, Todd Skinner and Paul Piana became the first to free climb El Cap via one of its major routes: the Salath\u00e9 Wall. Over the years, it has always taken a significant effort from a world-class climber or pair of climbers to establish a new free climb. \n  \n Few have ever made free climbing El Capitan look easy. \n  \n Tommy Caldwell, however, might be the one exception. He has free climbed 11 of those 13 routes\u2014an unmatched record. For training purposes, Caldwell once free climbed two routes on El Capitan in a 24-hour period. In other words, he free climbed 3,000 feet of difficult rock, hiked five miles (eight kilometers) back down to the base of the wall, and then climbed a different route, all within a single day, and all in the name of training for the Dawn Wall. \n  \n In 2007 Caldwell underwent a painful divorce from Beth Rodden, another well-known professional climber. \"I was amid the darkest period of my life,\" Caldwell wrote in Ascent. \"The Dawn Wall became an excellent distraction.\" \n  \n Despite the fact that free climbing the Dawn Wall appeared to be impossible, Caldwell threw himself into the project. Simply finding the route took him a full year of exploration. This process involved rappelling down the face and swinging around to identify enough consecutive hand- and footholds to allow for continuous upward passage. Also time-consuming was installing the dozens of protection bolts needed to climb these crackless sections of rock. \n  \n To hand drill a single hole three inches deep\u2014the size needed for a standard expansion bolt\u2014takes about 45 minutes. Adhering to the code of free climbing, Caldwell placed the minimum needed to avoid a fatal fall. \n  \n In the spring of 2008, he was joined on the wall by a documentary film crew, all friends who provided some much-needed company and support. The resulting cult classic climbing film, Progression, showed Caldwell working out the movements and wondering if the route would ever be done by him\u2014or anyone. \n  \n \"I thought that the film would at least show the climbing world what this line was all about,\" said Caldwell. \"If I couldn't do it, then maybe someone else could.\" \n  \n Caldwell says he received an e-mail from Jorgeson \"almost immediately\" after Progression was released. Jorgeson said he was inspired by the film and wanted to join Caldwell for the adventure, \"even if it's just a way to learn the ways of big-wall free climbing,\" he wrote. \n  \n In the fall of 2009, Jorgeson, having never climbed El Cap before, joined forces with Caldwell. By all accounts, they made an unlikely team. \n  \n Photograph by Corey Rich, Big Up Productions \n  \n Style Defined by Granite \n  \n Jorgeson grew up in Santa Rosa, California, a few hours west of Yosemite and an hour north of San Francisco. He started climbing in a gym at age 11 and by 16 was competing in indoor climbing competitions. \n  \n He garnered a reputation for being a powerful climber. He specialized in bouldering, which is climbing boulders up to about 20 feet (six meters) tall via the most difficult sequence of moves known. His expertise expanded to include the much riskier \"highball bouldering,\" which means climbing really tall boulders up to 60 feet (18 meters). \n  \n In the Buttermilks, a bouldering area outside of Bishop, California, Jorgeson established the first ascent of a boulder called Ambrosia, which features intricately difficult moves along its entire length. His climb of the 60-foot-tall boulder in 2009 was considered one of the boldest climbing achievements of the year. \n  \n Jorgeson first visited Yosemite for bouldering on his 16th birthday. He's made a tradition of returning to the valley for his birthday every year since. \"The granite here has defined my style and what I like to seek out,\" Jorgeson said. \"It's been hugely influential in leading up to what I'm doing right now on the Dawn Wall.\" \n  \n Photograph by Corey Rich, Big Up Productions \n  \n Highs and Lows \n  \n In the spring of 2008, six months after starting the Dawn Wall project partly to take his mind off his recent divorce, Caldwell met Rebecca Pietsch, a woman who seemed \"way out of my league,\" says Caldwell. \n  \n Pietsch had just started climbing and approached Caldwell, asking if he knew anything about the sport. Within a year after they met, the two were married. Their son, Fitz, is now nearly 21 months old\u2014about a year younger than when Tommy first started climbing. \n  \n \"The Dawn Wall has been the only constant in my life for the past seven years,\u201d he said last week by phone from his portaledge. \u201cEverything else changed, but the Dawn Wall has still been there.\" \n  \n He added jokingly, \"I'm not going to know how to live if we send this thing. I'm totally going to go through a midlife crisis for sure.\" \n  \n Posting on her blog, Rebecca wrote, \"The Dawn Wall started out as a little bit of an escape from a deep pain Tommy felt from the sadness of splitting up with his former wife. He deemed the wall impossible to free climb. He came back to it a year later, and with the excitement of a budding relationship between us decided that the Dawn Wall just might be possible. Our relationship began with this route, and the Dawn Wall has weaved its way through our lives together over the past six years.\" \n  \n The Dawn Wall has also been an opportunity for Caldwell to be a mentor to Jorgeson. \n  \n \"For so many years, I could never do the moves on pitch 16,\" said Jorgeson. \"Then, this week, I never fell on that section. A lot of that comes from spending so much time with Tommy over the last five years. Through him, I've learned how to approach this type of climbing.\" \n  \n The Dawn Wall has been the only constant in my life for the past seven years. Everything else changed, but the Dawn Wall has still been there. \n  \n Caldwell and Jorgeson have made five attempts over the past half decade to free climb the Dawn Wall from bottom to top. Over the years, highs and lows have abounded. In 2011, Jorgeson took a fall on pitch 16 and pulled ligaments in his ankle, sidelining him for the rest of the year. \n  \n In 2013, Caldwell fractured a rib when he dropped a hundred-pound haul bag that was attached to his harness via a hundred-foot rope; the force of the bag hitting the end of the line pulled the rib out of place. Also that year, the government shutdown closed all national parks, including Yosemite, stealing away valuable time for the climbers to spend on the route. \n  \n Over the years, some of the strongest free climbers in the world have joined Caldwell and Jorgeson to work on unlocking the free-climbing \"puzzle\" of the hardest pitches. Some of the biggest names in American rock climbing have tried their hands at the Dawn Wall, including Jonathan Siegrist, Alex Honnold, and Chris Sharma. \n  \n Jorgeson has been Caldwell's most consistent partner, and since 2009 he has joined Caldwell on every attempt. He started out having never free climbed even one route on El Cap. Today, after five years of work, he has finally completed his first, the most difficult of them all. \n  \n \"Tommy and I have very different attitudes and personalities,\" Jorgeson said. \"But I think they balance each other out really well. Tommy's optimism is, in a lot of ways, why this route is coming together. It would be really easy to write off the Dawn Wall as impossible over the last six years.

How ya\u2019 doin\u2019?\u201d Raleigh Ornelas hollers, leaning out the window of his spotless white pickup truck. He\u2019s recognized the man across the street, a developer standing in front of a Tuscan-style mansion under construction. \u201cWhere have you been hiding at? I call you, you don\u2019t call me.\u201d \n  \n Ornelas is an informal broker in Arcadia, Calif., a Los Angeles suburb at the foot of the San Gabriel mountains. He\u2019s been keeping an eye out for the builder, an Asian man with a slight comb-over who goes by Mark. Ornelas has found two older homeowners who\u2019ve finally agreed to sell their properties, and he knows that Mark, like all developers here, needs land on which to build mansions for an influx of rich clients from mainland China. \n  \n Ornelas rattles off addresses on a nearby street. \u201cThree-eleven, that guy, he\u2019s wack,\u201d he says, shaking his head. \u201cHe wants 2.8.\u201d He means million dollars. \u201cAnd then 354, they want $2 million.\u201d \n  \n The lot is 17,000 square feet. \u201cSeventeen for 2 mil?\u201d Mark asks, incredulous. \n  \n \u201cI know,\u201d Ornelas says. \u201cThey\u2019re going crazy.\u201d \n  \n A year ago the property would have gone for $1.3 million, but Arcadia is booming. Residents have become used to postcards offering immediate, all-cash deals for their property and watching as 8,000-square-foot homes go up next door to their modest split levels. For buyers from mainland China, Arcadia offers excellent schools, large lots with lenient building codes, and a place to park their money beyond the reach of the Chinese government. \n  \n The city, population 57,600, projects that about 150 older homes\u201453 percent more than normal\u2014will be torn down this year and replaced with mansions. The deals happen fast and are rarely listed publicly. Often, the first indication that a megahouse is coming next door is when the lawn turns brown. That means the neighbor has stopped watering and green construction netting is about to go up. \n  \n Damon Casarez for Bloomberg BusinessweekOrnelas matches sellers with developers. Deals happen fast; many aren\u2019t listed publicly \n  \n This flood of money, arriving from China despite strict currency controls, has helped the city build a $20 million high school performing arts center and the local Mercedes dealership expand. \u201cThank God for them coming over here,\u201d says Peggy Fong Chen, a broker in Arcadia for many years. \u201cThey saved our recession.\u201d The new residents are from China\u2019s rising millionaire class\u2014entrepreneurs who\u2019ve made fortunes building railroads in Tibet, converting bioenergy in Beijing, and developing real estate in Chongqing. One co-owner of a $6.5 million house is a 19-year-old college student, the daughter of the chief executive of a company the state controls. \n  \n Arcadia is a concentrated version of what\u2019s happening across the U.S. The Hurun Report, a magazine in Shanghai about China\u2019s wealthy elite, estimates that almost two-thirds of the country\u2019s millionaires have already emigrated or plan to do so. They\u2019re scooping up homes from Seattle to New York, buying luxury goods on Fifth Avenue, and paying full freight to send their kids to U.S. colleges. Chinese nationals hold roughly $660 billion in personal wealth offshore, according to Boston Consulting Group, and the National Association of Realtors says $22 billion of that was spent in the past year acquiring U.S. homes. Arcadia has become a hotbed of the buying binge in the past several years, and long-standing residents are torn\u2014giddy at the rising property values but worried about how they\u2019re transforming their town. And they\u2019re increasingly nervous about what would happen to the local economy if the deluge of Chinese cash were to end. \n  \n Back on the street corner, Ornelas and Mark agree to meet for coffee to discuss other deals. Before he drives away, Ornelas asks if the developer wants to speak with a reporter. Mark declines, saying he tries to keep a low profile. \u201cSee?\u201d Ornelas says as he pulls away, leaning toward the passenger seat and raising his eyebrows. \u201cEverything\u2019s hush-hush here in Arcadia.\u201d \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n For almost a century after its founding in 1903, Arcadia was white and conservative. In the late 1930s more than 90 percent of the city\u2019s property owners signed agreements, circulated by the Chamber of Commerce, to sell only to white buyers. Its Santa Anita racetrack held about 19,000 Japanese Americans as they were relocated to internment camps during World War II. In the early 1980s an influx of immigrants from Taiwan arrived, drawn in large part to the great public schools. A second wave came from Hong Kong after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. The city\u2019s Asian population grew from 4 percent in 1980 to 59 percent in 2010. There were tensions at first\u2014a letter in a local newspaper praised a proposed ban on non-English storefronts, writing, \u201cPlease leave your Asian signs in the old country and get Americanized.\u201d Over time, the new residents got involved in civic life, joining the Rotary Club, entering local government, and opening businesses such as Din Tai Fung Dumpling House, a Taiwanese restaurant tucked in the corner of a strip mall. \n  \n Arcadia has no real downtown, only low-rise commercial stretches lined with real estate offices and boba tea shops; Din Tai Fung is the closest thing there is to a central hub. Hostesses with walkie-talkies manage the hourlong wait of people clamoring for plump soup dumplings and pork buns. It was here, a decade ago, that Ornelas broke into Chinese real estate. Leaving lunch one day, he spotted a Ferrari parked outside. \u201cBoy, that\u2019s a beautiful car,\u201d he said. The owner was Chinese and asked Ornelas if he wanted to take it for a drive. Ornelas squeezed in and took a quick spin. As he returned, a white man walked by and made a racial slur about the owner. \n  \n \u201cI said, \u2018Leave the guy alone,\u2019 \u201d Ornelas recalls. The talk escalated into a fistfight, which ended badly for the heckler. Ornelas is a Vietnam veteran who spent years bare-knuckle boxing for cash while working as a longshoreman. \u201cThe Chinese guy goes, \u2018I\u2019m a stranger. Why did you stick up for me?\u2019 I said, \u2018We\u2019re all equal in this world, man.\u2019 \u201d After that, Ornelas says, \u201cI just met people from him, and then I got into different developers.\u201d \n  \n \u201cObviously if your house isn\u2019t feng shui-friendly, it\u2019s like we\u2019re not even going to have a conversation\u201d \n  \n Ornelas matches them up with sellers. He swings by garage sales to chat up owners, and as he drives Arcadia\u2019s streets, he looks for signs a homeowner may need money. On a blistering hot day in July, he goes scouting through the city\u2019s foothills. \u201cThe roof is popping in that one there,\u201d he says, pointing to an older ranch house. \u201cThis one, they put a new roof on, but the house is in bad shape.\u201d Ornelas stops at a corner lot, where a property is under construction. \u201cLook at how big that house is,\u201d he says. \u201cOoof. Gigantic.\u201d \n  \n As Ornelas tells it, last year the real estate website Zillow (Z) had estimated the property\u2019s value at $1.2 million when he, on behalf of a developer, offered the owner $1.5 million. The owner\u2019s brother, who worked in law enforcement, called Ornelas to ask if he was laundering money. \u201cI told him, \u2018That\u2019s what the house is worth to me,\u2019 you know? And he kind of investigated to see if it was dirty money. Everything was on the uppity-up, so he sold it to us.\u201d Where Ornelas\u2019s tales can be checked against public records, they stand up\u2014Zillow did make the lower estimate, the house did sell for $1.5 million, and the owner\u2019s brother is a sergeant with the county sheriff\u2019s department. (The lawman didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.) \n  \n Next, Ornelas drives over to one in a string of construction sites in the city\u2019s Upper Rancho neighborhood, where large lots line curving streets shaded by gracious oak trees. At the site, buzz saws blare, and stacks of plywood lie on a concrete foundation. Richard Smith, the sun-tanned owner of a construction company working on seven homes in Arcadia, walks over to talk shop. Smith is building the 11,000-square-foot home for a developer who expects to sell it, he says, for $8 million to $9 million. Smith grew up in Arcadia, and his company has only Asian clients. They have certain preferences. \u201cObviously, if your house isn\u2019t feng shui-friendly, it\u2019s like we\u2019re not even going to have a conversation,\u201d he says. That means minding the number of stairs, the directions rooms face, and how materials line up. \u201cAnd understanding the value of water, that\u2019s probably one of my key strengths,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you go to any successful businessman in China, or even here, they generally will have a picture of water behind their desk.\u201d He whips out his phone and swipes to photos of a project with a waterfall cascading off the top of a gazebo and into a backyard pool. \n  \n Photograph by Damon Casarez for Bloomberg BusinessweekA teardown that sold for $2.75 million in July 2013 \n  \n Smith says many of the newest buyers in Arcadia don\u2019t speak English. \u201cThey\u2019ve just come here,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re on that EB\u2014what\u2019s it called?\u201d He means the EB-5 visas that the U.S. grants to foreigners who plow at least $500,000 into American development projects. Congress created the program in 1990 to spur investment, and demand for the visas has grown recently. This year, for the first time, the government gave away the annual allocation of 10,000 visas before the year was over, with Chinese nationals snapping up 85 percent. Brokers in the area say it\u2019s the most common way buyers are coming to town. \u201cOnce they obtain residency, they want to bring their family over and get the United States education,\u201d says real estate agent Ricky Seow. \u201cThey can start a new life in California.\u201d \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n Taillights whiz by as 19-year-old Cheng Qianrong heads east along the freeway that runs from Los Angeles International Airport toward Arcadia, in a video she posts in June to her 22,000 Instagram followers. Later that night she stands in a marble kitchen, points a gold iPhone at a mirror, and, with a hip to the side, snaps a picture of her reflection, writing, \u201cI\u2019m finally home.\u201d \n  \n Loading \u3002\u3002 View on Instagram \n  \n A sophomore studying business at the University of Oregon, Cheng, who goes by Heli in the U.S., is a minor social media celebrity in China. In selfies, her long, straight hair and wide-eyed gaze make her look younger than she is. Her followers express awe for her style and gush at photos of her enjoying a smoothie; posing with stuffed animals; and smiling with a birthday cake made to look like a stack of Tiffany boxes. \n  \n In late 2013, Cheng and her mother, Wang Jun, bought a 9,000-square-foot house with a pool and spa in Arcadia for $6.5 million. According to an L.A. property filing, Wang\u2019s husband is Cheng Qingtao. He\u2019s CEO of China Huayang Economic & Trade Group, one of the first state-owned companies set up by the central government, which still owns a majority stake. Heli\u2019s two-story chateau-style home is only a few miles from one owned by her aunt, who\u2019s married to Cheng\u2019s older brother, Cheng Qingbo. Qingbo was the first private owner of railroads in China and, by 2013, was the country\u2019s 257th-richest person, worth an estimated $1.06 billion, Hurun says. In June, Shanghai police arrested Qingbo for allegedly duping people into investments, including a project that, China Business News says, didn\u2019t exist. \n  \n For most Arcadians, it would be hard to know if Heli owned the house next door. A member of one homeowners association estimates that about 20 percent of the new purchases sit empty, and for those who don\u2019t speak Mandarin, language barriers have made it hard to share more than a wave with neighbors. For many sales, public records provide no way to understand who the new owners are. A recorded deed may show just an English transliteration of a buyer\u2019s name, with no signature. Some public documents provide small clues: a second address in a luxury condo near Tiananmen Square; a seal if a document has been notarized at the U.S. Embassy in Guangzhou; a husband who relinquishes rights to the land to his wife; or a signature in Chinese characters. \n  \n Chinese nationals hold $660 billion in personal wealth offshore; they spent $22 billion on U.S. homes in the past year \n  \n Some of those clues match up with public documents in China. A mile north of the Chengs, Fu Youhong and Zhang Jian, a couple who founded a pharmaceutical distributor in China before starting a business converting agricultural waste into energy, bought a $3.5 million home advertised as a \u201cspectacular brand-new French Normandy Estate.\u201d Pesticide manufacturer Huifeng International USA got into the boom early, in 2012, and for $3.4 million bought a house with a grand circular staircase and Swedish sauna. The company says the property is used as an office for its trading business and not as a personal home. And a $3.2 million property in one of Arcadia\u2019s rare gated communities was sold to a woman from Guangzhou named Zeng Fang, who runs a network of immigration sites, one of which, baby-usa.net, tells Chinese mothers they can deliver babies at Arcadia Methodist Hospital. \n  \n A few miles south, another new house, this one with Tuscan styling and Moorish window treatments, sold last year to a woman named Jin Liping. Her husband, Du Jianming, is the owner of one of China\u2019s largest private builders of steel structures. His company has built bridges in Shanghai and connecting railways on the Tibetan Plateau. His wife bought the 8,000-square-foot house in Arcadia for $4.8 million in September 2013, around the same time the couple faced financial pressures at home. They lost three lawsuits in China related to unpaid loans, but their home in California looks in peak condition, with little red ribbons tied around the topiary by the front door. \n  \n A goldenrod-yellow house on South 6th Avenue belongs to Tao Weisheng and Du Xiaojuan, who develop homes and run hotels in Chongqing. Tao is known in China for collecting calligraphy and paintings\u2014and for reportedly paying bribes to bureaucrats. According to state-run media, in 2004, Tao and a business partner paid a local official\u2019s gambling debt at a Macau casino. The official had given them a land certificate they needed for a loan. In 2010 the court found the official guilty of taking a bribe and gave him a suspended death sentence. The prosecutor didn\u2019t charge Tao and his partner. The homeowners or their representatives declined to comment or did not respond to interview requests. \n  \n Lately, groups of Chinese investors have pooled their money to buy Arcadian homes, which often aren\u2019t occupied. More than 400 residents showed up at a community meeting with the police department this spring, in part concerned about a spate of burglaries targeting empty mansions. When there are leaks or other problems with a property, even the city struggles to identify who\u2019s responsible. \u201cWho do we contact? Where do we contact them?\u201d says Jim Kasama, the community development administrator for the city\u2019s building department. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s not that easy.\u201d \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n Arcadia is on track to bring in record revenue this year. In the fiscal year ended in June, fees from building permits and development reached $7.9 million, a 72 percent increase from the previous year. Its quiet streets are busy with gardeners blowing leaves and laborers laying roofs. This summer, the high school updated its gym and cafeteria. For a generation of older homeowners, the boom has created one hell of a nest egg. The Great Recession hit many retirees hard, but now they\u2019ve sold and moved to cheaper places a few miles away. As Smith, the contractor, says, \u201cThey still live close, but they\u2019ve got 2 million bucks in their bank account.\u201d \n  \n With so many homes vacant and language barriers prevalent, distrust is building. There are strange rumors\u2014local officials on the take; bridal studios as fronts for massage parlors\u2014and stranger truths. Just steps from the Arcadia police station, a local TV news reporter uncovered a hotel being used for birth tourism. A member of one homeowners association says a developer told the local board at various meetings that three separate homes he was building were all for his own family. When the board called him on it, he said his wife couldn\u2019t decide which one she wanted. \n  \n \u201cThe growth we\u2019re experiencing isn\u2019t typical,\u201d Kasama says. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we have new subdivisions. It\u2019s the houses that are growing.\u201d The city\u2019s homeowners associations can do only so much\u2014three years ago, the city changed a regulation that limits their ability to cap the size of houses. \n  \n Neighborhood disputes are getting intense. Dong Chang, a local dermatologist who told the Rotary Club that he left Taiwan in the early 1970s with \u201ctwo bags of rice and a frying pan,\u201d is suing the developer building a mansion next door for cutting down an old oak tree on his property. He\u2019s seeking about $280,000, saying the harm was \u201cintentional, fraudulent, oppressive, malicious, and despicably done.\u201d \n  \n Courtesy City of ArcadiaA red sign reading \u201cCannon against dogs\u201d hangs from one of two replica cannons a developer installed pointing to his neighbor across the street \n  \n Then there\u2019s the cannon incident. That battle went down on West Las Flores Avenue, on a block with a mix of older homes and newer construction, including a house owned by David Tran, the Huy Fong sriracha magnate. A family moved into a new home in 2008 and flanked the front walkway with two waist-high lion statues, the \u201cfu dogs\u201d that guard imperial Chinese palaces. A few years later, a developer named Ricky Tang began building his own home across the street. Tang didn\u2019t care for the lions, but their owners refused to remove them. In January 2011, according to city records, Tang mounted two replica cannons on top of a construction trailer in the front of his lot, aiming back at the lions. A red sign reading \u201cCannon against dogs\u201d in Chinese hung from each cannon. \u201cThe neighbor across the street took offense,\u201d Kasama says. \u201cHe felt they looked threatening.\u201d Soon a city-owned Prius pulled up, lights flashing, with an official entreating Tang to take down the weaponry. He acquiesced after a month of haggling. Tang didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. \n  \n Mary Garzio, a widow who\u2019s Tang\u2019s neighbor, calls him \u201ca very nice man.\u201d She says he\u2019s been wooing her to sell her 73-year-old house for $3 million in cash. He brings over fruit and says she can live rent-free until she gets settled elsewhere. \u201cHe says, \u2018You\u2019re a good neighbor, Mary. I don\u2019t want you to leave, but I want your home.\u2019 \u201d \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n Arcadia\u2019s Chinese buyers may have made their wealth in different ways, but they face a common problem: getting their cash to America. China controls the flow of its currency, restricting residents from converting more than $50,000 in yuan into foreign denominations each year. At that pace it would take half a lifetime for a couple to buy a $4 million home. \n  \n Jeff Needham, a senior vice president at HSBC (HSBC), says it\u2019s most common for buyers to transfer money from personal or business accounts they already have in Hong Kong, which doesn\u2019t impose caps. \u201cIn most of our buyer situations, they have funds outside China already that they have accumulated over years,\u201d he says, adding that the bank verifies the source of the funds. \n  \n It\u2019s trickier for those without accounts in Hong Kong. Chen Ping, a local broker, says there\u2019s a common workaround. \u201cWe call it \u2018head-count wiring,\u2019 \u201d she says. Buyers line up other people\u2014friends, family, or, if need be, paid strangers\u2014to each transfer a share. \u201cI once had a customer who bought a $1.9 million house in Arcadia who said, \u2018Not a problem. I have more than enough head counts,\u2019 \u201d Chen says. Many buyers have legitimate ways to wire the funds, says broker Imy Dulake, but \u201cthere is no way we can have this much cash coming in legally.\u201d \n  \n When they can\u2019t get enough money through, property records show many get mortgages to buy the homes, often putting at least 40 percent down. Others buy with all cash and later take out home-equity loans, freeing up funds for other investments in the U.S. without going through the rigmarole of getting money across the Pacific again. Dozens of Chinese homeowners in Arcadia have loans from HSBC and East West Bancorp (EWBC), both of which have branches in China. HSBC\u2019s Needham says the bank gives \u201cpremier\u201d clients a discounted rate, and it can underwrite loans in the U.S. based on international credit scores and assets overseas. East West didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. \n  \n Even as they fret about their town, longtime Arcadians worry about a sudden end to the money. What happens if the U.S. limits visas, the Chinese government clamps down, or the \u00e9migr\u00e9s pick another place to park their cash? \u201cHow high we go, we can\u2019t foresee, because we never know the policy changes,\u201d real estate agent Seow says. This summer, after an expos\u00e9 on China Central Television, the Bank of China ended a government program that quietly let some customers convert an unlimited amount of yuan into dollars and transfer it overseas. And President Xi Jinping\u2019s anticorruption campaign has raised the specter of a larger slowdown. \u201cI was in escrow on a property before this crackdown, and oh my God, they could not get their money out\u201d of China, broker Dulake says. The sale fell through. \n  \n Stig Hedlund lives on the block with the cannons, in a house built in 1937 by his grandfather, a civil engineer who laid out many of the city\u2019s roads when everything was still alfalfa fields. Now Hedlund is wondering if he should leave. He\u2019s received nice offers for his house, like when a broker and a couple drove up his driveway unannounced in a black Mercedes one Sunday morning; the broker knocked on the front door, saying the couple wanted to buy his home. He\u2019d like to wait until his last son graduates from college, but he fears his \u201cfive-year plan\u201d will make him miss the boom. When he reads news about recent protests in Hong Kong, he wonders how China\u2019s response will ripple across the mainland. \u201cIf a communist government starts putting the kibosh, isn\u2019t it more incentive to get money out of the country?\u201d he asks. Or would a crackdown mean he blows his chance to sell? It\u2019s a question central to Arcadia\u2019s gardeners and construction workers, the car salesmen and the boba tea makers, who all rely on the money surging out of China. For now, Hedlund figures he can wait a little longer. He hears Ornelas just brokered a sale down the street for $2.8 million. ||||| To the editor: I moved to Arcadia in 2001 because it had great public schools and was still affordable for a single parent like myself.

Parts of Samoa are starting to ration water. \n  \n Supplies are precariously low after a severe lack of rain in a region where underground reserves have been fouled by saltwater from rising seas that scientists have linked to climate change. \n  \n While nobody has gone thirsty yet, officials worry about the logistics of supplying everyone with enough water to survive and the potential health problems that might arise. And exactly how the islands will cope in the long term remains a question mark. \n  \n \"We are praying that things will change,\" Samoan-based official Jovilisi Suveinakama said. \n  \n Six months of low rainfall have dried out the islands. Climate scientists say it's part of a cyclical Pacific weather pattern known as La Nina _ and they predict the coming months will bring no relief, with the pattern expected to continue. \n  \n Rising sea levels are exacerbating the problem, as salt water seeps into underground supplies of fresh water that are drawn to the surface through wells. \n  \n On the three main atolls that make up isolated Tokelau, the 1,400 residents ran out of fresh water altogether last week and are relying on a seven-day supply of bottled water that was sent Saturday from Samoa, Suveinakama said. \n  \n Suveinakama said that some schools no longer have drinking water available, and that the students often need to return home if they want to use a bathroom. \n  \n \"In terms of domestic chores, like washing clothes, everything's been put on hold,\" he said. \"We are cautious of the situation given the possible health issues.\" \n  \n Suveinakama said that Tokelau, a territory of New Zealand, has tapped emergency funds to buy desalination machines, which turn salt water into fresh water. He hopes those will be shipped to the islands soon. \n  \n In Tuvalu, a nation of low lying atolls that is home to less than 11,000 people, Red Cross team leader Dean Manderson described the situation as \"quite dire.\" \n  \n He said that on the island of Nukulaelae, there were only 16 gallons of fresh water remaining Tuesday for the 350 residents and that the Red Cross was sending over two small desalination machines. \n  \n He said much of the well water on Tuvalu is unusable because it has become contaminated with salt water. \n  \n The New Zealand government this week flew a defense force C-130 plane to Tuvalu stocked with Red Cross supplies of bottled water and desalination machines. Officials including High Commissioner Gareth Smith also flew over to assess the situation. \n  \n Smith said the coconut trees on Tuvalu are looking sickly and that the edible breadfruit, which grow in trees, are much smaller than usual. He said other local fruits and vegetables, including a type of giant taro, are not growing well or are in short supply. \n  \n He said people in the capital of Funafuti are permitted a ration of two buckets of water per day and that government ministers have been bathing in the lagoon to preserve water. \n  \n Funafuti residents have been relying on a large desalination machine for much of their daily water supply, said Manderson. The Red Cross has been helping improve the function of that machine and has been fixing other such machines that have broken down, he added. \n  \n New Zealand climate scientist James Renwick said the rainfall problems can be traced back 12 months, when the region began experiencing one of the strongest La Nina systems on record. \n  \n La Nina is sparked when larger-than-normal differences in water temperature across the Pacific Ocean cause the east-blowing trade winds to increase in strength, Renwick said. That, in turn, pushes rainfall to the west, leaving places like Tuvalu and Tokelau dry. \n  \n Last year's La Nina system dwindled by June but has begun picking up again just ahead of the November rainy season, Renwick said, meaning that there is no relief in sight for island groups like Tuvalu, Tokelau and Samoa. \n  \n \"Low rainfall continues to be on the cards, at least through the end of the year,\" Renwick said. \n  \n Officials say they are concentrating on the short-term supply problems and have not yet had time to think about longer term solutions for the islands. But they say that the combination of rising water levels and low rainfall mean makes life on the islands look increasingly precarious. ||||| Image caption Water supplies will have to be brought to Tokelau by barge from ships anchored offshore \n  \n A second South Pacific community is suffering a severe water shortage due to an ongoing drought crisis. \n  \n Tokelau declared a state of emergency late on Monday, following a similar move in neighbouring Tuvalu, where water is already being rationed. \n  \n A New Zealand-administered territory of three islands, Tokelau's 1,400 people have less than a week's drinking water left. \n  \n The lack of rainfall is blamed on the La Nina weather pattern. \n  \n Officials said Tokelau had run out of natural fresh water and was relying solely on bottled water. \n  \n New Zealand Foreign Minister Murray McCully said other islands in the South Pacific were also reporting water shortages. \n  \n Parts of Samoa have begun rationing water. \n  \n He said New Zealand was rushing to assess the situation throughout the region, amid fears the crisis could escalate. \n  \n This is having a severe impact on crops, so there's likely to be a food shortage as well Murray McCully, NZ Foreign Minister \n  \n New Zealand was \"making sure we deal with the drinking water issue most urgently\", he said. \n  \n A New Zealand Air Force plane landed in Tuvalu on Monday carrying containers of water and desalination units. \n  \n Tuvalu, one of the world's smallest independent nations, with a population of about 11,000, lies about halfway between Australia and Hawaii.

In fact, only seven of the 120 samples of red snapper purchased nationwide were actually red snapper. The other 113 samples were another fish. \n  \n Our findings demonstrate that a comprehensive and transparent traceability system \u2013 one that tracks fish from boat to plate \u2013 must be established at the national level. At the same time, increased inspection and testing of our seafood, specifically for mislabeling, and stronger federal and state enforcement of existing laws combating fraud are needed to reverse these disturbing trends. \n  \n Our government has a responsibility to provide more information about the fish sold in the U.S., as seafood fraud harms not only consumers\u2019 wallets, but also every honest vendor and fisherman cheated in the process--to say nothing of the health of our oceans. \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n NOTE: Oceana did not test any canned tuna samples and all samples labeled as \u201cwhite tuna\u201d were purchased at restaurants or sushi venues. ||||| Ninety-five percent of the sushi restaurants, 52 percent of other restaurants and 27 percent of grocery stores surveyed sold mis\u00adlabeled seafood. While academics, consumer groups and media outlets in the United States and elsewhere have scrutinized fish labeling before and found major errors, Oceana\u2019s effort is one of the largest seafood investigations to date. \n  \n In its study, Oceana did not mention the names of the food stores, restaurants and sushi houses it visited because the group cannot identify specifically where in the distribution chain the fraud occurred. If you ask those in the fish business, they likewise have different ideas on where the mislabeling begins. \n  \n Bob Kinkead, the veteran chef and restaurateur behind such seafood emporiums as the recently shuttered Kinkead\u2019s, said the deception can occur anywhere along the distribution chain but notes that some suppliers prey on ignorant chefs. \u201cI think chefs are uninformed\u201d on species of fish, said Kinkead, who recently opened \u00adAncora in the Watergate. \u201cIt\u2019s not dishonesty. It\u2019s carelessness.\u201d \n  \n Darren Lee Norris, co-owner of Kushi Izakaya & Sushi near Mount Vernon Square, however, pointed a finger directly at restaurateurs. \u201cI think it comes down to a restaurant or chef who\u2019s trying to buy something cheaper and jazz it up and call it something else.\u201d \n  \n The technology to conduct species tests has become relatively inexpensive and widely available in recent years, said Prof. Mahmood Shivji of Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., who has conducted genetic testing on fish species since 2007 and advised Oceana on its study. \n  \n Although agencies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have genetics laboratories, Shivji said, \u201cthey are really bogged down. They don\u2019t have enough personnel, the workload is huge and they don\u2019t have the money\u201d to conduct routine tests. \n  \n The Food and Drug Administration tests less than 1 percent of seafood sold in the United States for fraud, according to a 2009 Government Accountability Office report. \n  \n Steven Wilson of NOAA\u2019s seafood inspection program, said he thinks the rate of species substitution \u201cis very low,\u201d averaging less than 5 percent. \n  \n He said purveyors are much more likely to inflate the weight of the seafood they\u2019re selling, by adding water. Inspectors have found inaccurate weight counts 40 percent of the time, Wilson said. ||||| Truth in Seafood Labeling: A senior scientist at Oceana discusses the group's new study that found that about one-third of fish samples in 12 metropolitan areas were mislabeled. \n  \n SEATTLE \u2014 Many Europeans are fretting these days over horse meat, and whether it might have adulterated their shepherd\u2019s pie. Over here, it\u2019s all about the red snapper. \n  \n That tempting seafood delight glistening on the ice at the market, or sizzling at the restaurant table in its aromatic jacket of garlic and ginger? It may not be at all what you think, or indeed even close, according to a big new study of fish bought and genetically tested in 12 parts of the country \u2014 in restaurants, markets and sushi bars \u2014 by a nonprofit ocean protection group, Oceana. \n  \n In the 120 samples labeled red snapper and bought for testing nationwide, for example, 28 different species of fish were found, including 17 that were not even in the snapper family, according to the study, which was released Thursday. \n  \n The study also contained surprises about where consumers were most likely to be misled \u2014 sushi bars topped the list in every city studied \u2014 while grocery stores were most likely to be selling fish honestly. Restaurants ranked in the middle. \n  \n Part of the problem, said the study\u2019s chief author, Kimberly Warner, is that there are quite simply a lot of fish in the sea, and many of them look alike. Over all, the study found that about one-third of the 1,215 fish samples bought, from 2010 to 2012, were mislabeled. \n  \n \u201cEven a relatively educated consumer couldn\u2019t look at a whole fish and say, \u2018I\u2019m sure that\u2019s a red snapper and not lane snapper,\u2019 \u201d she said. \n  \n Geographically, the study had bad news for residents of Southern California, land of the midnight sushi. They were more likely than residents in any of the other sampled regions to be eating something other than what they had been told. About 52 percent of the samples bought and sent for testing turned out to be something else. \n  \n Salmon-crazed Seattle, by contrast, was tied with cod-country Boston as having the lowest deception rates. Still, almost one in five fish samples were wrongly labeled. \n  \n Some types of fish fared worse in different places. In New York, for example, fish that was not really tuna was being passed off as tuna in 94 percent of the samples taken, the study said. \n  \n What is in a name, anyway, when it comes to fish? Shakespeare might not have pondered the question exactly, but the seafood industry certainly has. \n  \n In the real world of perception and marketing, a fish called \u201cslimehead\u201d \u2014 a real name, by the way \u2014 is probably not going to fly off the menu. Far better to call it \u201corange roughy,\u201d a distinction allowed by the Federal Food and Drug Administration. The government also allows Patagonian toothfish, real name, to be called Chilean sea bass, invented marketing name. \n  \n The Oceana study did not declare a fish mislabeled if the seller was following the federal guidelines. \n  \n But what the study found pervasive was mislabeling \u2014 beyond what is allowed by federal food regulators \u2014 by retail outlets using a name that consumers are more likely to want to buy. Almost two-thirds of the \u201cwild\u201d salmon samples, for example, were found actually to be farmed Atlantic salmon, which is considered less healthy and environmentally sustainable. \n  \n The National Fisheries Institute, a trade group, said in a statement that reputable members of the seafood community are fighting fraud, and that the federal government should \u201cfulfill its mandate,\u201d to enforce food fraud laws already on the books. \n  \n Dr. Warner said that the study did raise some red flags about health. Fish known to accumulate mercury in their flesh, in particular, should be avoided, especially by pregnant women. But in what the study called \u201cone of the most egregious swaps,\u201d in New York, tilefish \u2014 known for its mercury content and on federal advisory lists for sensitive populations to avoid \u2014 was sold as red snapper. Tilefish was also found substituted for halibut. \n  \n She also cautioned that the study did not aim to produce a real scientific, top-to-bottom sampling of the seafood system. In Boston, for example, only grocery store fish were tested, leaving out sushi bars that might have lowered the city\u2019s honesty rate (although, in a separate effort in 2011 and 2012, The Boston Globe found widespread mislabeling in stores and restaurants). \n  \n And the Oceana study\u2019s authors also could not determine where in the food chain the mislabeling arose \u2014 the wholesaler, the retailer or at the fishing dock itself \u2014 or whether it came about through misunderstanding or deliberate concealment. \n  \n A common pattern, though, Dr. Warner said, was economic gain at the consumer\u2019s expense, with understudy fish \u2014 tilapia, in particular \u2014 often substituting for a menu\u2019s star, without a word to the audience. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Sigur\u00f0ard\u00f3ttir, warned Jewish and Muslim people could feel \"unwelcome\" in Iceland. \n  \n \"The danger that arises, if this bill becomes law, is that Judaism and Islam will become criminalised religions,\" she said. \"We must avoid all such forms of extremism.\" \n  \n Is circumcision safe? \n  \n By Michelle Roberts, BBC News Online health editor \n  \n Although it is a relatively simple medical procedure, circumcision is not entirely risk free. \n  \n Doctors may recommend that a man or boy is circumcised if he has an unusually tight foreskin, known as phimosis, or suffers from recurrent infections of the foreskin and penis, known as balanitis. \n  \n There is also some evidence that men who are circumcised have a lower risk of contracting HIV from HIV-positive female partners. \n  \n It is not clear if circumcision reduces the risk of other sexually transmitted infections too, but studies suggest it may lower the chance of catching genital warts caused by a family of viruses called HPV. \n  \n The main risks of the surgery are bleeding and infection. \n  \n In the UK, the chance of these occurring is between one in 10 and one in 50, according to the NHS website, although that is a figure for older boys and men, not the newborns who would be most affected by the Icelandic ban. \n  \n How do other countries compare? \n  \n Circumcision is legal throughout Europe, although the practice is becoming more controversial. \n  \n A court in Germany passed a local ban in 2012 after the circumcision of a four-year-old Muslim boy led to complications, with the judge saying it \"permanently and irreparably changed\" the body. \n  \n However, the German government later that year clarified the act is legal provided it is performed by trained practitioners. \n  \n The following year, the Council of Europe recommended countries take steps to ensure good medical and sanitary practices when performing a circumcision. \n  \n And in the UK in 2016, a court ruled that a Muslim father could not have his sons circumcised after their mother disagreed. ||||| Iceland is poised to become the first European country to outlaw male circumcision amid signs that the ritual common to both Judaism and Islam may be a new battleground over religious freedom. \n  \n A bill currently before the Icelandic parliament proposes a penalty of up to six years in prison for anyone carrying out a circumcision other than for medical reasons. Critics say the move, which has sparked alarm among religious leaders across Europe, would make life for Jews and Muslims in Iceland unsustainable. \n  \n One in three men globally is thought to be circumcised, the vast majority for religious or cultural reasons. Many Jews and Muslims fear the issue of circumcision could become a proxy for antisemitism and Islamophobia, pointing to similar tensions over religious dress and the ritual slaughter of animals for meat. \n  \n Muslim and Jewish leaders attacked the proposal, while Cardinal Reinhard Marx, president of the Catholic Church in the European Union, said the bill was a \u201cdangerous attack\u201d on religious freedom. \u201cThe criminalisation of circumcision is a very grave measure that raises deep concern.\u201d \n  \n The Icelandic bill says the circumcision of young boys violates their rights and is incompatible with the United Nations convention on the rights of the child. It draws a parallel with female genital mutilation, already outlawed in most European countries. \n  \n The bill says circumcisions are performed without anaesthesia, and claims the procedure is often carried out \u201cin homes that are not sterile, and not by doctors but by religious leaders. There is a high risk of infections under such conditions that may lead to death.\u201d \n  \n It acknowledges that while parents have the right to give religious guidance to their children, \u201csuch a right can never exceed the rights of the child\u201d. Boys who wish to be circumcised for religious or cultural reasons can do so when they reach an age at which they \u201cunderstand what is involved in such an action\u201d, it suggests. \n  \n Iceland\u2019s population of about 336,000 includes tiny Jewish and Muslim communities. There are thought to be some 250 Jews and about 1,500 Muslims. \n  \n Silja D\u00f6gg Gunnarsd\u00f3ttir of the centre-right Progressive party said she had proposed the bill after realising that there was no ban on male circumcision although FGM has been outlawed in Iceland since 2005. \u201cIf we have laws banning circumcision for girls, then we should do so for boys,\u201d she said. \n  \n \u201cWe are talking about children\u2019s rights, not about freedom of belief. Everyone has the right to believe in what they want, but the rights of children come above the right to belief.\u201d \n  \n Nordic countries had well-deserved reputations for promoting human rights, she added. \u201cIf Iceland backs this, I think other countries will follow.\u201d \n  \n The issue of circumcision has been raised in other European countries but none has outlawed it. \n  \n According to Milah UK, a Jewish campaign group to protect the right to circumcision, the procedure is only carried out by highly-trained and regulated practitioners, known as mohelim. Boys are usually circumcised at eight days old. \n  \n A spokesperson for Milah UK said: \u201cJewish male neonatal circumcision \u2013 known as brit milah \u2013 is a non-negotiable element of Jewish identity, common to Jews from all backgrounds and respected in liberal democratic countries. For a country such as Iceland, that considers itself a liberal democracy to ban it, thus making sustainable Jewish life in the country impossible, is extremely concerning.\u201d \n  \n Parallels with FGM were unwarranted, Milah UK said. The partial or complete removal of female genitalia could make intercourse difficult and painful and cause serious medical complications. In contrast, circumcision was a minor procedure. \n  \n \u201cThere is no recognised long-term negative impact on the child for the rest of his life. Millions of men \u2013 Jews as well as others \u2013 are circumcised around the world, and are unaffected in their everyday lives by having undergone the procedure. Carrying out brit milah on newborn boys is a central requirement of Jewish law,\u201d the spokesperson said. \n  \n Moshe Kantor, president of the European Jewish Congress, called for respect for the values of openness and tolerance, and added there was no evidence that circumcision was harmful. \n  \n \u201cWe can only assume that this attempt to ban a core practice of Jewish communities comes from ignorance about the practice and its effect on Jewish children, rather than to send a message that Jews are no longer welcome in Iceland,\u201d he said. \n  \n Ahmad Seddeeq, the imam of the Islamic Cultural Center of Iceland, said the bill contravened religious freedom. \u201cCircumcision has been practised for centuries, it is deeply rooted in cultural and religious traditions,\u201d he said. \n  \n A meeting of religious organisations in Iceland was called earlier this month to discuss the bill, and they hoped to issue a declaration of opposition, he added. \n  \n Muslims in Iceland were already travelling to neighbouring countries to have the procedure performed on babies because of the reluctance of local doctors. But, Seddeeq said, \u201cthe [medical] benefits of this practice far exceed the risks\u201d. \n  \n Jewish and Muslim communities warn that if circumcision is outlawed, the practice will go underground or religious minorities will travel or relocate to countries where it is permitted. \n  \n In Germany, a 2012 law permits only trained practitioners to perform circumcisions. It followed a controversial German court ruling which said circumcision \u201cpermanently and irreparably changed\u201d a child\u2019s body, and took away the individual\u2019s right to \u201cmake his own decision on his religious affiliation\u201d. \n  \n The following year, the Council of Europe passed a resolution calling on 47 member states to regulate practices concerning ritual circumcision, \u201cto overcome some of the prevailing traditional methods, which do not take into consideration the best interest of the child and the latest state of medical art\u201d. Israel said the resolution fostered \u201chate and racist trends in Europe\u201d. \n  \n Two years ago, a judge sitting in a British family court said that young children should not be circumcised until they are old enough to decide for themselves. NHS advice is that \u201cthe risks associated with circumcisions when carried out by qualified and experienced doctors are small\u201d. \n  \n The Icelandic bill comes against a backdrop of a number of European countries prohibiting Islamic religious dress, such as the niqab or burka. This spring the Danish parliament will debate a bill banning full-face veils in public. \n  \n Last year Belgium voted to ban halal and kosher meat, citing animal rights. Poland\u2019s government has proposed a law prohibiting kosher slaughter, in a move vehemently opposed by the Jewish community. \n  \n The Icelandic bill on circumcision has cross-party backing and wide public support, Gunnarsd\u00f3ttir said. If it passes its first reading, the bill will go into committee stage for several months before it can become law. |||||", "output": "The world's oldest parliament will soon be debating Europe's first ban on circumcising male children for non-medical reasons\u2014a tradition campaigners call \"male genital mutilation.\" The bill before Iceland's parliament proposes a six-year prison sentence for anybody removing part or all of a child's sexual organs, the BBC reports. Supporters say circumcising young boys violates their rights, while opponents\u2014including Jewish and Muslim leaders, as well as Cardinal Reinhard Marx, president of the Catholic Church in the European Union\u2014argue that it violates the religious freedom of the country's small Muslim and Jewish communities, believed to number around 1,500 and 250 people, respectively. The religious leaders say the ban could make Jews and Muslims feel \"unwelcome\" in Iceland. The bill\u2014which says boys shouldn't be circumcised for religious or cultural reasons until they're old enough to decide for themselves\u2014was proposed by Silja Dogg Gunnarsdottir of the Progressive Party, the Guardian reports. She says she decided to introduce the bill after realizing the country had banned female genital mutilation without addressing male circumcision. \"If we have laws banning circumcision for girls, then we should do so for boys,\" she says. \"We are talking about children's rights, not about freedom of belief.

Someone has outdone the \"Team America\" puppet sex scene and even made it look somewhat quaint in comparison. Anyone even vaguely interested in the very R-rated animated film \"Sausage Party \" has likely heard whispers about the food orgy. Words can't even begin to do this sequence justice, but I guarantee you've never seen anything like it in a mainstream studio movie. It's jaw-dropping. \n  \n Of course it's compliments of the minds that blew up a foreign leader in \"The Interview\" and reveled in the comedy of rape by demon in \"This is the End.\" Yes, co-writers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg have used their singular and delightfully twisted imaginations once more to concoct what is easily the year's most audacious film. And it's packaged in animation cutesy enough for Pixar. \n  \n In the grand tradition of \"Toy Story,\" ''Sausage Party\" imagines the lives of the foodstuffs in the local supermarket aisle. But it doesn't merely anthropomorphize the food. It gives them sexuality, lust, ethnicities and even religion. \"Sausage Party\" is just as much a sweet story about belief and faith as it is a vehicle for the filthiest jokes you've never dared imagine. \n  \n Frank (Seth Rogen), a non-descript hot dog, waits somewhat impatiently with his fellow mates to be selected by the gods (humans) to be taken to a paradise in The Great Beyond (purchased). Everyone in the store knows something good is out there waiting. The foods and condiments and sweets begin every day with a rousing song about The Great Beyond and the Gods, each putting their own spin on it (i.e. the German mustard has added a line about exterminating Juice). \n  \n For Frank, it's all about paradise and the chance to match with his soul mate Brenda (Kristen Wiig), a sexy hotdog bun with Barbie legs and a desire equal to Frank's. They're waiting for the gods to choose them before they act on anything. \n  \n Things go awry when they are chosen. A jar of Honey Mustard (Danny McBride) that was returned to the store by a customer is so traumatized by what he's seen \"out there\" that he jumps out of the cart to his death. A few follow him out of their packages to try to save him and get tossed from the cart, including Brenda, Frank, Sammy Bagel Jr. (Edward Norton, affecting his best Woody Allen), Lavash (David Krumholtz) and a Douche (Nick Kroll), who becomes dead set on killing Frank for preventing him from reaching The Great Beyond. \n  \n And that group goes off exploring \u2014 some trying to get back to their spot in the store, some searching for the truth, and some (the Jewish bagel and Middle Eastern flatbread) waxing philosophical on the nature of belief. Those that made it to The Great Beyond, including Frank's hot dog buddy Barry (Michael Cera), experience the horrors of dinner time. \n  \n As in all Rogen and Goldberg films, no matter how raunchy, there is a big heart at the center. It's what distinguishes them from the anything goes satire of Matt Stone and Trey Parker. Anything goes here too, but it's rooted in something deeper and infinitely more earnest. \n  \n \"Sausage Party,\" directed by Greg Tiernan and Conrad Vernon with co-screenwriting credits for Kyle Hunter and Ariel Shaffir, might not be for everyone (especially kids drawn to the posters and perplexed that cute animation might not actually always be for them), but it's a wild good time that will offend, shock and even delight. \n  \n There is no one out there making comedies quite like Rogen and Goldberg. They are putting their definitive stamp on the modern American comedy one decency-smashing double entendre at a time. \n  \n \"Sausage Party,\" a Columbia Pictures release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for \"strong crude sexual content, pervasive language, and drug use.\" Running time: 89 minutes.

If everyone at Pixar simultaneously developed an incurable super-disease and decided to say, \"to hell with it,\" they would make Sausage Party. If the head of a major studio wanted to burn Hollywood to the ground as revenge for some unknown slight, they would make Sausage Party. But none of that actually happened \u2013 Sausage Party was produced by allegedly rational animators, paid for by a seemingly legitimate studio, and supervised by a supposedly mentally sound and emotionally rational creative team. \n  \n All of which fails to explain how, exactly, the Sausage got made. Because this adults-only cartoon about sentient supermarket items is not only the raunchiest film of the year, nor is it simply the most shocking \u2013 it is, without a doubt, the most delirious movie to come out of a major studio in decades, perhaps ever. It is anarchic, outrageous, filthy and, for a good stretch, sublimely subversive. It is all manner of berserk in concept and tone and execution that it's a wonder it was let out the door. But does its unbridled madness mean it's a good movie, too? The answer, like the film itself, is problematic. \n  \n First, there's the conceit, which immediately divides its potential audience: Either you're cool with the idea that hot dogs and tacos and baby carrots can talk (and have feelings and sexual urges and bouts of extreme violence), or that strikes you as irredeemably stupid. Okay, fine, there's the exit. But for those willing to go along with Seth Rogen (and his many co-writers') surely pot-enhanced idea, the rewards are plenty. Because this isn't just a movie about anthropomorphized Twinkies dropping F-bombs or endless wiener-in-bun jokes (though, yes, it is that, too) \u2013 Sausage Party is an exercise in extremes, in just how far a big-budget film can push the limits of religion, politics, sex, ethnicity, everything. \n  \n Story continues below advertisement \n  \n The insanity begins at Shopwells, a suburban grocery store whose denizens begin each day with a cheery Alan Menken-esque tune (shockingly, by Alan Menken) about achieving salvation via \"The Gods\" \u2013 the fat and frumpy humans who, it is believed, will bestow eternal happiness upon whichever foodstuffs they take home. Eager for this rapture are hot dog Frank (Rogen) and disconcertingly sexy bun Brenda (Kristen Wiig). Once they've been chosen and let loose from their packaging, so the gospel goes, they will be united both spiritually and, um, sexually. \n  \n But then one day along comes a jar of honey mustard, returned to the store after being mistaken for Dijon. And he has terrible tales to share \u2013 the Gods, they are crazy. They only want death and destruction, to fuel their insatiable hunger. There is no great beyond, and life, essentially, is a lie. So, pretty heavy stuff for a comedy that's mostly marketed itself as an R-rated barrage of genital jokes \u2013 and as the film goes on, Rogen and company only dig deeper into what it means to lose faith, and question one's purpose. \n  \n Yet Sausage Party is not here to just tease existential quandaries \u2013 it is determined to mix those concepts into a messy stew of outrageous humour and shocking vulgarity. Thus we get jars of sauerkraut singing about eliminating \"the juice,\" a box of grits holding a grudge against literal crackers, and a piece of lavash flatbread baiting a Woody Allen-sounding bagel over \"disputed aisle territory.\" \n  \n Oh, and there is a subplot about synthetic bath-salt drugs, a gory sequence of food-on-human violence, not one but two Meatloaf/Bat Out of Hell jokes, a hilariously disgusting riff on Saving Private Ryan, and a massive, bewildering sex scene that goes further than anything you might dare imagine. (Yes, even that. And that, too!) \n  \n From one moment of Sausage Party to the next, it's unclear whether you're supposed to laugh or shudder or vomit or take to the streets in wild, fervent protest. The film mixes its remarkable highs with bewildering lows, and the end result is a blunt sense of aftershock. This \u2013 how did they make this? We may never know. \n  \n But by the time a stoned Frank turns to Brenda and asks the previously unimaginable question of, \"Are you ready to get baked with me and walk through Gum's Stargate?\", you'll be glad they did. ||||| Ahead of the August 12th premiere of Seth Rogen\u2019s R-Rated animated comedy \u201cSausage Party,\u201d a costumed hot dog and bun showed up on Denver Fox affiliate program \u201cEveryday\u201d in one of the weirdest morning show promos we\u2019ve ever seen. \n  \n The two shared an awkward hug before one of the production assistants came over and pretended to spread mustard on the hot dog, much to its mock terror. \n  \n Well, that\u2019s one way to advertise for the film, we guess. \n  \n RELATED: This hilarious \u201cSausage Party\u201d PSA will change the way you think about barbecue |||||", "output": "Just because a film is animated doesn't mean you should take your kids to see it.

He was sentenced Jan. 24, 2018, to 175 years in prison after pleading guilty to sexually abusing seven girls. \n  \n This story was originally published Sept. 12, 2016. \n  \n Two former gymnasts, one an Olympic medalist, have accused a prominent, longtime team physician for USA Gymnastics of sexual abuse. \n  \n One of the women filed a civil lawsuit Thursday in California that was released Monday. The other filed a complaint two weeks ago with police in Michigan. \n  \n The women, in separate interviews with IndyStar, provided detailed accounts that closely mirrored each other as they outlined their allegations against Dr. Larry G. Nassar. Nassar served as USA Gymnastics\u2019 team physician during four Olympic Games and left his position last September with little public notice. \n  \n Dr. Larry Nassar, D.O. (Photo: Becky Shink/Lansing State Journal 2008 file photo) \n  \n Nassar, a faculty member at Michigan State University who has treated the university\u2019s gymnasts, has not been charged with any crime. His lawyer, Matthew Borgula, said Nassar \u201cemphatically\u201d denies any wrongdoing. \n  \n After being shown a copy of the lawsuit Monday, Borgula said, \u201cDr. Nassar, to the extent the allegations are against him, adamantly denies any misconduct at this or any other time.\u201d \n  \n The women said they were molested during multiple treatments in the 1990s and early 2000s. The two women said the doctor fondled their genitals and breasts. One of them said Nassar also spoke about oral sex and made other inappropriate comments when they were alone, according to court records. The other woman said she told police Nassar was visibly aroused as he examined her during one medical visit. \n  \n The Olympic medalist sued Nassar and USA Gymnastics in California, where she lives. The woman, who is unnamed in the suit, alleges that the Indianapolis-based organization failed to act on suspicions about the doctor\u2019s conduct. Her attorney would not provide IndyStar with evidence to support that allegation. \n  \n \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into the details because, frankly, it would give the defense an unfair advantage,\u201d the attorney, John Manly, said. \n  \n His client said USA Gymnastics allowed Nassar to examine her alone in private rooms in violation of best practices and the organization\u2019s current standards of conduct. \n  \n The other woman, who lives in Louisville, Kentucky, filed a police complaint against Nassar last week at Michigan State University. As a teenage gymnast, she was treated there by Nassar, according to medical records. \n  \n The university said it suspended Nassar from \u201cclinical and patient duties\u201d Aug. 30, when it received the criminal complaint. He will remain suspended during the investigation. University officials also began an investigation under Title IX of the federal Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender in educational programs. \n  \n On Monday, USA Gymnastics reiterated a statement it made last week in response to previous questions about Nassar from IndyStar: \n  \n \u201cDr. Nassar is no longer affiliated with USA Gymnastics. Upon learning of athlete concerns, USA Gymnastics immediately notified law enforcement. Since then, we have cooperated fully with the law enforcement agency, including refraining from making further statements or taking any other action that might interfere with the agency\u2019s investigation. We are grateful to the athletes for coming forward to share their concerns.\u201d \n  \n The organization, which serves as the sport\u2019s national governing body and selects the Olympic team, would not respond to specific questions about its handling of the allegations against Nassar. But after the story was published on IndyStar.com, USA Gymnastics issued a subsequent statement with more detail. \n  \n It said USA Gymnastics received the allegations in the summer of 2015 and \u201crelieved Dr. Nassar of his duties.\u201d \n  \n In addition to serving as a faculty member at Michigan State\u2019s College of Osteopathic Medicine, Nassar is a team physician at Twistars Gymnastics Club USA in Michigan and worked as a team physician for Michigan State University and Holt High School. Officials at Michigan State and Twistars said USA Gymnastics did not inform them of the concerns. Nassar resigned from USA Gymnastics last fall but continued to work with young athletes at Michigan State and Twistars. \n  \n In August, an IndyStar investigation revealed that USA Gymnastics executives repeatedly failed to forward allegations of sexual abuse at its member clubs to law enforcement authorities. The organization relied on a policy of not alerting authorities unless allegations came directly from an athlete or an athlete\u2019s parent or guardian, according to testimony in court records. \n  \n IndyStar is not naming the California woman at her request and because she was identified only as \u201cJane Doe\u201d in the lawsuit. The other, Rachael Denhollander, said reading IndyStar\u2019s investigation inspired her to speak out. \n  \n \u201cOver the last 16 years, I\u2019ve realized I have a responsibility, and the question about whether or not to speak publicly cannot center around what\u2019s easy for me,\u201d she said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something I want to do.\u201d \n  \n \u2018Damaged goods\u2019 \n  \n Denhollander filed a criminal complaint against Nassar two weeks ago with Michigan State University Police, alleging the doctor sexually assaulted her when she received treatment for lower back pain as a 15-year-old club-level gymnast in 2000. University officials confirmed that police are conducting a criminal investigation. \n  \n She said Nassar gradually became more abusive over five treatments, massaging her genitals, penetrating her vagina and anus with his finger and thumb and unhooking her bra and massaging her breasts. She said she also relayed those details to police. \n  \n Nassar\u2019s attorney said his client never used a procedure that involved penetration. \n  \n Denhollander said her mother was present during Nassar\u2019s treatments, but that he positioned himself and her in such a way that only her head and back were visible. \n  \n Buy Photo Rachael Denhollander poses at her home in Louisville, Kentucky, on Aug. 23, 2016. She recently filed a police report in Michigan, alleging that she was sexually abused by Dr. Larry Nassar, formerly the main physician for USA Gymnastics. (Photo: Robert Scheer/IndyStar) \n  \n \u201cI was terrified,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI was ashamed. I was very embarrassed. And I was very confused, trying to reconcile what was happening with the person he was supposed to be. He\u2019s this famous doctor. He\u2019s trusted by my friends. He\u2019s trusted by these other gymnasts. How could he reach this position in the medical profession, how could he reach this kind of prominence and stature if this is who he is?\u201d \n  \n She said she figured the problem must be with her. \n  \n \u201cPart of that, I know now, is a very common response that victims have,\u201d Denhollander said. \u201cIt\u2019s much easier in some ways to hide from what\u2019s happening and just go somewhere else mentally. It was easier to not have to verbalize and recognize what was happening.\u201d \n  \n Years later, while Denhollander and her husband, Jacob, were dating and contemplating a future together, she nervously told him about the alleged abuse. They were on swings at a playground. \n  \n \u201cShe was telling it from the perspective of feeling that she was damaged goods, that she was broken, and would I put up with that,\u201d Jacob Denhollander said. \u201cTo me, that was one of the most heartbreaking things, to hear that had been her experience, and her perspective was, \u2018I\u2019m dirty because of it. I\u2019m damaged.\u2019\u201d \n  \n Rachael Denhollander said she knows that if her case is prosecuted, she might be called to testify publicly in court about deeply personal and sensitive experiences. \n  \n \u201cI hate that idea,\u201d she said. \u201cI hate it. But if I don\u2019t, he can continue.\u201d \n  \n \u2018Instrumental to the success\u2019 \n  \n Nassar, 53, has been a high-profile figure in gymnastics for decades. During one of the sport\u2019s iconic moments, U.S. Olympic team officials handed over gymnast Kerri Strug to Nassar for medical attention after she performed on the vault with an injured ankle. At the time, it was believed to be the performance necessary to secure the gold medal in the 1996 Olympics. \n  \n USA Gymnastics President Steve Penny once praised Nassar as being \u201cinstrumental to the success of USA Gymnastics at many levels, both on and off the field of play.\u201d In that 2014 news release, Penny added that Nassar\u2019s \u201ccontributions over the years are immeasurable and will continue to be so.\u201d \n  \n Nassar is president of the Gymnastics Doctor Autism Foundation, which helps gymnastics clubs establish programs for special needs children, and his Facebook page is filled with tributes to him. \n  \n \u201cHe\u2019s an extremely professional physician,\u201d John Geddert, the 2012 Olympic team head coach and owner of Twistars Gymnastics, told IndyStar. \u201cVery competent and goes above and beyond the call of duty in treating athletes. He\u2019s probably one of the most respected gymnastics professionals I\u2019ve ever had to deal with.\u201d \n  \n IndyStar was unable to find any other allegations of sexual misconduct against Nassar in civil or criminal court records. \n  \n In 2014, he posted on Facebook that he would continue working with women\u2019s artistic gymnastics \u201cfor as long as the program feels I can be an asset to them.\u201d In June 2015, Nassar wrote a Facebook post saying he intended to stay on as U.S. Olympic team doctor through the Rio Olympics. \n  \n Yet three months later, Nassar was no longer team doctor. Last month, Nassar explained on Facebook why he wasn\u2019t at the Rio Olympics. He said he retired so he could run for a school board position in Holt, Michigan. \n  \n \u201cI knew that if I dedicated the time needed to be at the 2016 Rio Olympics, I would not be able to prepare a campaign for the school board,\u201d he wrote. \n  \n Borgula, his lawyer, said Nassar\u2019s retirement had nothing to do with allegations of sexual abuse, but he did acknowledge that USA Gymnastics had informed the doctor of potentially criminal allegations prior to his resignation. \n  \n USA Gymnastics would not tell IndyStar which law enforcement agency it reported to. And Borgula said no agency ever contacted Nassar concerning the allegations USA Gymnastics said it forwarded to police. \n  \n How many athletes expressed concerns to USA Gymnastics, and when those concerns were received, is unclear. The two athletes who approached IndyStar said they did not report their concerns directly to USA Gymnastics. \n  \n The lawsuit was filed in Sacramento County against Nassar, USA Gymnastics and the organization\u2019s past three presidents, including Penny. None of the individuals was mentioned by name, but Manly, the attorney, confirmed the identities of the defendants targeted by the suit. \n  \n The lawsuit claims USA Gymnastics not only hid complaints about Nassar, it failed to adequately supervise his activities. The lawsuit claims Nassar \u201cwould do anal and vaginal examinations of Plaintiff and other gymnasts in the care of (USA Gymnastics) without gloves, a chaperone, and/or any form of lubricant.\u201d \n  \n The California woman told IndyStar she didn\u2019t report the alleged abuse at the time because she didn\u2019t know it was wrong. According to the lawsuit, the abuse started when she was 12 or 13 and continued until she was 18. \n  \n \u201cIt felt like a privilege to be seen by him,\u201d she said. \u201cI trusted him.\u201d \n  \n Her lawsuit said the procedures Nassar performed were \u201cwell outside any recognized and/or accepted technique and were done for the Perpetrator\u2019s \u2026 own sexual gratification.\u201d \n  \n Nassar would \u201cfondle and grope Plaintiff\u2019s feet, ankles, thighs, buttocks, hips, waist, breasts, arms, shoulders and neck, placing Plaintiff under the impression this inappropriate contact was part of treatment,\u201d according to the suit. \n  \n The lawsuit also claims Nassar talked to the California gymnast about sex, describing oral sex and telling her that other underage gymnasts were doing it. \n  \n The California woman told IndyStar it took her more than a decade to understand what Nassar had done. She never told anyone until July. And she wept as she tried to talk about how it affected her life. \n  \n The lawsuit says she \u201csuffered immensely\u201d from anxiety, depression, a lack of trust and \u201cself-medicating behavior.\u201d \n  \n \u201cIt\u2019s a lot,\u201d she said. \n  \n Call IndyStar reporter Mark Alesia at (317) 444-6311.

Her attorneys on Monday identified her only as a medal-winning member of the team that competed in the 2000 Sydney Olympics. \n  \n The second gymnast, Rachael Denhollander of Louisville, Kentucky, told the Indianapolis Star newspaper that Nassar sexually abused her in 2000 while she underwent treatment for lower back pain at Michigan State University, where Nassar is a faculty member. \n  \n Denhollander, who was 15 at the time, told the Star that Nassar became gradually more abusive over the course of five treatments, including massaging her breasts and penetrating her. She said she filed a complaint last month with university police. \n  \n Denhollander said her mother was at the therapy sessions, but that Nassar positioned himself in such a way that she couldn't see what was happening. \n  \n \"I was terrified,\" Denhollander said. \"I was ashamed. I was very embarrassed. And I was very confused, trying to reconcile what was happening with the person he was supposed to be. He's this famous doctor. He's trusted by my friends. He's trusted by these other gymnasts. How could he reach this position in the medical profession, how could he reach this kind of prominence and stature if this is who he is?\" \n  \n Nassar's attorney, Matthew Borgula, said in an email to The Associated Press that Nassar plans to \"vigorously defend himself.\" \n  \n \"Dr. Nassar denies any misconduct relating to any gymnast, patient or anyone else,\" Borgula wrote. \"To the extent he provided medical treatment to anyone, that treatment was always done with consent of the patient. He is proud of his 29 years of volunteer service with USA Gymnastics.\" \n  \n The California lawsuit says that USA Gymnastics negligently suppressed, concealed or failed to disclose knowledge that Nassar had engaged in sexual conduct with team members. \n  \n \"Our client represents the very best America has to offer,\" John Manly and Vince Finaldi, the attorneys who filed the lawsuit, said in a statement. \"She sacrificed her youth and adolescence, spending thousands of hours in rigorous and often painful training to bring glory to our nation as an Olympic athlete. She had an absolute right to trust USA Gymnastics, its coaches and staff. Unfortunately, they have proven time and again that they are more interested in protecting the reputation of their multi-million-dollar enterprise than the child athletes who are entrusted to their care.\" \n  \n The lawsuit does not provide specific instances where USA Gymnastics knowingly withheld information. \n  \n USA Gymnastics released a statement Monday night indicating that Nassar was relieved of his position in the summer of 2015 when the organization's President Steve Penny went to authorities when learning of athlete concerns about Nassar. \n  \n \"USA Gymnastics has cooperated fully with the law enforcement agency since we first notified them of the matter, including \u2014 at their request \u2014 refraining from making further statements or taking any other action that might interfere with the agency's investigation,\" the statement read. \"We are grateful to the athletes for coming forward to share their concerns when they did.\" \n  \n Nassar has also been temporarily relieved of clinical and patient duties with Michigan State, where he is an associate professor in the sports medicine program, pending the police investigation into the criminal complaint, according to school spokesman Kent Cassella. \n  \n University police did not immediately respond to phone and email messages left by The AP. \n  \n ___ \n  \n Graves reported from Pittsburgh. |||||", "output": "There was an ugly secret at the heart of Team USA Gymnastics for many years, according to two women who accuse a longtime team doctor of abusing them as teens. In separate legal complaints, the women say Larry Nassar groped and fondled them during multiple treatments in the 1990s and early 2000s. One woman, a medal-winning Olympian, identified only as \"Jane Doe,\" has filed a lawsuit in California accusing Nassar of molesting her between the ages of 12 and 18, reports the Indianapolis Star. She accuses USA Gymnastics of ignoring suspicions about Nassar and says it took her years to realize that the man she trusted had been abusing her. \"USA Gymnastics failed this woman,\" her attorney says. The other woman, Rachael Denhollander, tells the Star that she was a club-level gymnast in 2000 when Nassar abused her at Michigan State, where he's a faculty member.

The new study blames the leaks on the reactor\u2019s cooling canals, which were recently found to have caused a massive underground saltwater plume to migrate west, threatening a wellfield that supplies drinking water to the Florida Keys. \n  \n Critics alleged the canals began running too hot and salty after Florida Power and Light (FPL), which operates the plant, overhauled two reactors to produce more power, the Miami Herald reports. A judge already recently found that FPL had failed to prevent hundreds of thousands of gallons of wastewater from seeping into the bay. \n  \n Mayor Stoddard argues the new study might point to violations of the federal Clean Water Act, and says only two solutions are viable: Building new cooling towers to replace the canals or shutting down the plant, the New Times reports. \n  \n \u201cThere\u2019s a certain validation to critics in seeing this result in the study,\u201d he says, \u201cbut more importantly, it\u2019s now crossed the threshold of federal law here.\u201d \n  \n Turkey Point is not the sole leaky plant in America. Last month, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo acknowledged that the state\u2019s Indian Point Nuclear facility was leaking tritium into groundwater. Meanwhile, The Vermont Department of Health has noted ongoing investigations into leaks at Vermont Yankee since 2010, while New York\u2019s FitzPatrick Plant has been \u201cplagued by water leaks\u201d in 2014, Gizmodo notes. \n  \n FPL is not responding to requests for comment. ||||| A radioactive isotope linked to water from power plant cooling canals has been found in high levels in Biscayne Bay, confirming suspicions that Turkey Point\u2019s aging canals are leaking into the nearby national park. \n  \n Be the first to know. No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. SIGN ME UP! \n  \n According to a study released Monday by Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez, water sampling in December and January found tritium levels up to 215 times higher than normal in ocean water. The report doesn\u2019t address risks to the public or marine life but tritium is typically monitored as a \u201ctracer\u201d of nuclear power plant leaks or spills. \n  \n The study comes two weeks after a Tallahassee judge ordered the utility and the state to clean up the nuclear plant\u2019s cooling canals after concluding that they had caused a massive underground saltwater plume to migrate west, threatening a wellfield that supplies drinking water to the Florida Keys. The judge also found the state failed to address the pollution by crafting a faulty management plan. \n  \n This latest test, critics say, raise new questions about what they\u2019ve long suspected: That canals that began running too hot and salty the summer after FPL overhauled two reactors to produce more power could also be polluting the bay. \n  \n How much damage is that cooling canal system causing the bay is a question to be answered. Everglades Law Center attorney Julie Dick \n  \n \u201cHow much damage is that cooling canal system causing the bay is a question to be answered,\u201d said Everglades Law Center attorney Julie Dick, who had not had a chance to review the report. \u201cThere are a lot more unknowns than knowns and it just shows how much more attention we need to be paying to that cooling canal system.\u201d \n  \n County commissioners, who have kept a close eye on the canals and objected to the state\u2019s management plan, ordered the additional monitoring of bay water last year. The commission is scheduled to discuss the canals, along with another study by University of Miami hydrologist David Chin examining problems linked to adding more water to the canals, at a meeting Tuesday. \n  \n FPL officials declined to comment Monday evening. \n  \n Over the last two years, problems with the canals have worsened exponentially. After the 2013 plant expansion to increase power output by 15 percent, the canals began running dangerously high. FPL officials blamed problems on an algae bloom that worsened after the canals were temporarily shut down during the project. But when a summer drought hit in 2014, temperatures spiked. At least twice, when temperatures soared to 102 degrees, the utility was nearly forced to power down reactors. \n  \n After obtaining permission from nuclear regulators to operate the canals at 104 degrees, the hottest in the nation, FPL officials began plotting a course to fix the canals by pumping in millions of gallons of fresh water from a nearby canal as well as increasing the amount of water drawn from the Floridan aquifer. \n  \n But the growing saltwater plume triggered regulatory scrutiny. After the county complained, the state ordered a new management plan, called an administrative order, to address problems. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection declined to cite FPL for violating state water laws and instead crafted a plan that critics said gave the utility license to continue to pollute. The plan, hastily approved two days before Christmas, was quickly challenged by county officials, as well as environmentalists and rock miners. \n  \n The county settled its challenge in October after FPL agreed to a series of actions to clean up the plume that included constructing a barrier made up of extraction wells. The utility also agreed to try to use salty water from the Floridan aquifer, rather than freshwater from the nearby canal intended for Biscayne Bay, or treated wastewater from a nearby county sewer plant. \n  \n The decree also called for increased monitoring that in the fall gave the first indication the canals had leaked into the bay when monitoring detected elevated levels of ammonia and phosphorus. After those findings, staff and FPL returned for another round of tests and to get a better read on what was happening in the bay. \n  \n Earlier sampling was taken near the bottom of the bay, where researchers expected to find evidence of the groundwater plume that had been documented west of the canals. For the most recent round, water was studied at varying depths. Samplers found that while water at the surface met most county water quality standards, nearly all the standards were exceeded at the bottom. \n  \n The county also looked for traces of tritium, a naturally occurring hydrogen isotope often found in minute amounts in groundwater but also commonly produced by high energy neutrons in a nuclear reactor. Tritium emits a relatively weak form of radiation that is not considered hazardous at low levels. \n  \n 130 to 215 timesThe higher rate of tritium in Biscayne Bay \n  \n Over the last five years, the report said, cooling canal water typically has tritium at levels 60 to more than 800 times higher than in the bay. Tritium at the bottom of the bay close to the canals ranged from more than 130 to 215 times higher \u2014 high enough to suggest a consistent flow from the sprawling cooling system. \n  \n County staff concluded the findings are \u201cthe most compelling evidence\u201d that canal water has spread into the bay. \n  \n While the county\u2019s consent decree requires FPL to address the spread, staff said more study is needed to determine exactly what\u2019s going on and come up with a long-term remedy for cleaning up the canals. ||||| Update 12 p.m.: FPL has responded to the study, saying it needs more time to review the specific data but defending its efforts to protect Biscayne Bay. \"Our top priority is the health and safety of the public, and there is no threat to the health and safety of the public,\" says Bianca Cruz, an FPL spokeswoman. \n  \n As Florida Power & Light finalized plans to expand its nuclear reactors at Turkey Point three years ago, critics were aghast. The nuclear plant already stands on environmentally fragile land, and upping the power production would seriously threaten the ecosystem, they argued. \n  \n Turns out they may have been right. This morning, the county released the results of a study into whether Turkey Point has been leaking dangerous wastewater into Biscayne Bay. County water monitors found more than 200 times the normal levels of tritium, a radioactive isotope linked to nuclear power production, in the bay water, a finding environmentalists say justifies their concerns. \n  \n \"This is one of several things we were very worried about,\" says South Miami Mayor Philip Stoddard, who is also a biological sciences professor at Florida International University. \"You would have to work hard to find a worse place to put a nuclear plant, right between two national parks and subject to hurricanes and storm surge.\" \n  \n The study is just the latest blow to FPL, which lost a state court ruling last month when a judge found the utility had failed to prevent hundreds of thousands of gallons of wastewater from seeping into the bay. \n  \n County commissioners and other local politicians are scrambling this morning to get answers about how threatened Biscayne Bay is by the leakage. \n  \n \"I was shocked to read this,\" says Commissioner Xavier Suarez, who in a letter demanded answers from FPL \"by the end of the day.\" County Mayor Carlos Gimenez, meanwhile, says the county has \"aggressively enforced its regulations\" and would demand that the state force FPL to fix the problem. \n  \n Adds State Rep. Jose Javier Rodriguez: \u201cFor years our state regulators have failed to take seriously the threat to our public safety, to our drinking water and to our environment posed by FP&L\u2019s actions at Turkey Point. Evidence revealed this week of radioactive material in Biscayne Bay is the last straw and I join those calling on the US EPA to step in and do what our state regulators have so far refused to do - protect the public.\u201d \n  \n At the heart of the troubling issue revealed in the new report is a system of canals surrounding the nuclear plant in southeast Miami-Dade. Nuclear cores must be constantly cooled to avoid meltdowns. The canals circulate water through the plant to leach heat off the reactors. \n  \n As FPL prepared to expand the plant's reactors in 2013, critics such as Stoddard warned that relying on the canals was a mistake. For one thing, environmentalists argued, the hot, salty canal water would inevitably leak back into Biscayne Bay and the Everglades. \n  \n \"They argued the canals were a closed system, but that's not how water works in South Florida,\" Stoddard says. \n  \n In the two years since, environmentalists have pointed to a growing litany of concerns, including spiking heat levels in the canals and saltwater plumes exploding from the power plant into nearby groundwater systems. Stoddard says salty water has intruded as far as four miles inland through groundwater. \n  \n But FPL resisted new monitoring, Stoddard says, and deflected blame. \"FPL has argued and argued and denied and denied there was any connection to their canals,\" he says. \"They've tried to prevent monitoring. They were successful until the county commission finally demanded this study.\" \n  \n FPL hasn't returned New Times' phone calls for comment on the study. The county's numbers are cited in another report released today, which was conducted by University of Miami scientist Dr. David Chin, who analyzed how an influx of new water could affect the cooling canals. \n  \n As for those elevated tritium levels, it's not clear whether the isotope itself is dangerous to people or wildlife at that concentration; that's one topic on which the commission will demand answers from FPL, Suarez says. \n  \n But the hot, salty water is certainly a problem for the delicate ecosystems in Biscayne National Park and the Everglades. Stoddard \u2014 who argues the new study might point to violations of the federal Clean Water Act \u2014 says he believes only two solutions are viable: building new cooling towers to replace the canals, or shutting down the plant. \n  \n \"There's a certain validation to critics in seeing this result in the study,\" he says. \"But more important, it's now crossed the threshold of federal law here.\" \n  \n Update 12 p.m.: While FPL says it needs to review the new county data on tritium levels in Biscayne Bay, the utility strongly defended its work to protect Biscayne Bay. Cruz, the FPL spokeswoman, points out the agency reached an accord with the county last October. In the agreement, FPL promises to clean up its act by pumping wastewater into a deep aquifer, among other steps. \n  \n \"We'll continue to comply with regulatory agreement we reached with the county in October,\" Cruz says. \n  \n Cruz also emphasized that FPL has collected its own data on impacts to Biscayne Bay and has seen no indication of a larger pollution problem. \n  \n \"We've collected this data for many years, and this data has reviewed by independent scientists,\" Cruz says. \"We're going to continue to work closely with regulatory agencies.\" \n  \n Cruz also criticized Stoddard for slamming the agency over the latest report. \"He's selecting portions of the data to further his anti-FPL campaign,\" she says. \n  \n  ||||| Last Visited \u00bb \n  \n As we continue our recovery and cleanup efforts, please visit the Emergency website for the latest information on openings and closings in Miami-Dade County. \n  \n Study on the Cooling Canal System at FPL Turkey Point Power Station \n  \n The Cooling Canal System (CCS) serving the FPL Turkey Point facility consists of a network of approximately 5,900 acres of canals that serve as a heat exchange system for the power plant units.

WSJ's Jen Valentino-DeVries and Lauren Goode discuss with Simon Constable what this means not only for app developers but how it impacts Apple's mobile iAd platform. \n  \n The move gives software developers more freedom to decide how to build their applications, or \"apps.\" It will relax restrictions Apple introduced in the spring that had effectively blocked use of programming technology from Adobe Systems Inc. and potentially impeded Google's AdMob ad network from serving ads to Apple apps. \n  \n The concession comes after the Federal Trade Commission launched an inquiry around June to determine whether Apple had violated antitrust laws with the earlier policy. It isn't clear if Apple's move Thursday was in response to the FTC's investigation, but it will likely be carefully scrutinized by the regulatory agency, said people familiar with the situation. \n  \n An Apple spokeswoman didn't respond to requests for comment about the FTC probe. The FTC declined to comment. \n  \n The change comes in the wake of a vicious public relations battle between Apple and Adobe, creator of a widely used technology called Flash that manages video and animations on many websites. Apple's revised policy will now allow apps to be written using a Flash-based tool, and also removes restrictions on what other programming languages developers may use. \n  \n But the revised policy still won't allow iPhone and iPad users to access Flash-based content on the Web. Those websites rely on running Adobe software code that doesn't reside on a user's device, which Apple's revised guidelines still prohibit. Still, Adobe investors embraced the news, driving shares up 12% to $32.86. \n  \n \"We are encouraged to see Apple lifting its restrictions on its licensing terms, giving developers the freedom to choose what tools they use to develop applications for Apple devices,\" Adobe said in a statement. \n  \n Google also welcomed the change. \"Unlike the previous version, these new terms ensure that Apple's developers have the choice of a variety of advertising solutions (including Google and AdMob's) to earn money and fund their apps,\" Omar Hamoui, Google's vice president of product management, said in a statement. \n  \n For consumers, the implications may be less evident. Apple still plans to review every app submitted to its App Store, and Flash-based video still won't be viewable on its mobile devices. And some prior restrictions, such as the one that affected AdMob ads, weren't being enforced by Apple. \n  \n Yet the change means more apps\u2014which range from videogames to news feeds to financial tools\u2014may be available sooner on multiple devices. It may also bring in new developers to the iPhone and iPad, who have been reluctant to comply with Apple's restrictive policies in the past. \n  \n \"They're opening up the platform to a much broader community of development,\" said Krishna Subramanian, co-founder of mobile ad company Mobclix Inc., which works closely with iPhone app developers. Mr. Subramanian added that it could particularly energize the mobile advertising market because ad developers are most familiar with Adobe's Flash programming software. \n  \n Apple on Thursday also published its app-review guidelines for the first time, addressing a longstanding complaint by developers about the lack of clarity in the process. The guidelines suggest, for example, that an app could be rejected if it isn't useful or doesn't provide lasting entertainment or other value. \n  \n The language in the guidelines seems to emulate the direct style of Steve Jobs, Apple's chief executive. \"We have over 250,000 apps in the App Store. We don't need any more Fart apps,\" the document reads. \n  \n Another section says apps that look like they were \"cobbled together in a few days\" could be rejected. \"We have lots of serious developers who don't want their quality Apps to be surrounded by amateur hour,\" it says. \n  \n Enlarge Image Close Associated Press Apple Computer Chief Executive Steve Jobs. \n  \n Some analysts said the changes show how threatened Apple is by the increasing momentum of Google's Android Market. App development for Android could heat up with the introduction in coming months of several Android tablet computers that will rival the iPad. \n  \n \"They're trying to make sure they stay the most interesting and most important development platform,\" said Jeffrey Hammond, an analyst with technology firm Forrester Research. \n  \n Apple's App Store is still the biggest app marketplace with over 250,000 applications, but Google's Android Market\u2014which doesn't vet apps\u2014has increased its number to more than 80,000 from 30,000 just six months ago. \n  \n Smartphones that run on Google's Android operating system also are expected to outsell iPhones this year. IDC, another tech research firm, estimates that by 2014, Android devices will hold world-wide market share of 25% while the iPhone's share will drop to 11% from 15% this year. \n  \n A number of software developers still see Apple's App Store as the most important market and many are devoting the majority of their resources toward it, but they also have been unhappy with the company's seemingly arbitrary rejection of apps. \n  \n Joe Hewitt, a Facebook Inc. software engineer, caused a stir last November when he announced he would stop developing for the iPhone because of Apple's review process. He said in an email that Apple's policy change is \"a wonderful improvement\" that shows Apple has improved the tone of its relationship with app developers. \n  \n Mr. Hewitt, who developed Facebook's iPhone app, said he was working on other projects but would probably develop for Apple's App Store again \"when I do have time someday.\" \n  \n Forrester's Mr. Hammond said some developers also are starting to develop apps for the Android Market first, so they can start making money immediately while they wait for the App Store version of the app to go through Apple's approval process. \n  \n \"Customers are saying, 'You know what, I don't have to do the iPhone. I have a lot of other viable choices,'\" said Dave Wolf, vice president of strategy at Cynergy Systems Inc., a Washington, D.C., software design firm that builds software using Flash and other programming languages. \"I think Apple saw that writing on the wall.\" \n  \n The publication of the app review guidelines could also help get new apps into the marketplace sooner and minimize some of the clutter.The FTC is investigating complaints that Apple had unfairly blocked developers from using Adobe's tools, as well as whether Apple's restrictions on applications sending data to third parties unfairly disadvantaged AdMob and benefited Apple's own mobile ad network, according to people familiar with the matter. \n  \n Meantime, the Justice Department is looking at Apple's iTunes music store and new Bookstore to see if agreements Apple has reached with music and book publishers improperly limit competition, said people familiar with the matter. \n  \n Apple has attracted increasing scrutiny from antitrust enforcers in the U.S. and Europe as it expanded from its minority position in personal computers to a major force in markets for smartphones, music, movies, TV and publishing. \n  \n In the U.S. it controls around 70% of online music sales and has more of the overall music market than Wal-Mart Stores Inc., according to market research firm NPD Group. It recently surpassed Microsoft Corp. in market value. \n  \n \u2014Cari Tuna contributed to this article. \n  \n Write to Yukari Iwatani Kane at yukari.iwatani@wsj.com and Thomas Catan at thomas.catan@wsj.com ||||| Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n  \n Apple, which keeps a tight lid on its products and inner workings, is loosening up a little. \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n The company said on Thursday that it would relax its rules on how software developers can build applications for its iPhone and iPad. And for the first time it published detailed guidelines explaining how it decides what programs can and cannot be sold through its App Store. \n  \n Apple has long faced criticism from developers who say its application review process is opaque and that it makes seemingly arbitrary decisions about what is acceptable for its customers. \n  \n This year, some were incensed when the company purged some sexually suggestive applications it deemed to be inappropriate \u2014 like a jigsaw puzzle featuring scantily dressed women \u2014 while a Sports Illustrated application with bikini-clad models remained. \n  \n Analysts said the moves on Thursday were a sign that Apple was growing increasingly aware of competition in the smartphone market, and was trying to be friendlier to the developers whose applications have helped drive the success of its products. \n  \n Photo \n  \n In particular, Android, the mobile operating system by Google, has steadily increased market share in the United States and abroad. Shipments of smartphones using Android grew by 886 percent during the second quarter from a year earlier, according to the research firm Canalys. And a wave of Android tablet computers that will compete with the iPad are on the way. \n  \n \u201cApple is concerned enough about the shifting tide towards Android that it feels it has to loosen restrictions to keep developers on its side,\u201d said Jeffrey S. Hammond, an analyst at Forrester Research. \n  \n Although Mr. Hammond said that Apple\u2019s App Store was outpacing opponents in both the number of applications available for download and the amount of revenue generated for developers, he said Apple\u2019s announcement was a \u201cpre-emptive strike.\u201d \n  \n \u201cGoogle has done a better job at leveling the playing field for independent developers, and that matters,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Apple can tolerate that, especially with the dozen or more pads that we\u2019re going to see hit the market in eight to nine weeks.\u201d \n  \n In the newly released guidelines, which are written in an unusually conversational style, Apple acknowledges that its App Store policies could give the impression that the company is made up of \u201ccontrol freaks,\u201d but adds that \u201cmaybe it\u2019s because we\u2019re so committed to our users and making sure they have a quality experience with our products.\u201d \n  \n Although the guidelines list many things that will lead to an app\u2019s rejection, like the inclusion of pornography or violent images, or mimicking features that are already on the iPhone, they still leave much to interpretation. For example, Apple says that \u201capps that are not very useful or do not provide any lasting entertainment value may be rejected.\u201d \n  \n Even so, software developers, many of whom have expressed frustration about the app review process, said the company\u2019s newfound candor came as a relief. \n  \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n  \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n  \n \u201cThis is gold. This is great,\u201d said Dom Sagolla, chief executive of Dollar App, a mobile development company based in the Bay Area. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019re finally getting a clue about what Apple wants.\u201d \n  \n \u201cThis is a document I\u2019ve been wanting to see for two years,\u201d said Raven Zachary, president of Small Society, a software development firm. \u201cIt\u2019s going to foster the creation of better apps because we know going in what to do and what to avoid.\u201d \n  \n Apple also said it would begin to allow developers to use third-party tools to create applications for its iOS mobile operating system, which is used on the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. It had banned such tools in April. \n  \n The change means developers can more easily convert applications written for other types of mobile phones, including those that use Adobe\u2019s Flash technology, which Steven P. Jobs, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has repeatedly said he will not support. The news bumped shares of Adobe up more than 12 percent to close at $32.86. Apple shares were little changed. \n  \n Apple\u2019s new rules also specify that developers can put advertisements in their applications that come from outside companies. Its earlier rules had raised some questions about whether developers would be limited to using Apple\u2019s iAd service, locking out companies like AdMob, which is owned by Google. \n  \n Omar Hamoui, the former chief executive of AdMob who is now the vice president for product management at Google, said in a blog post that the changes were \u201cgreat news for everyone in the mobile community.\u201d \n  \n \u201cApple\u2019s new terms will keep in-app advertising on the iPhone open to many different mobile ad competitors and enable advertising solutions that operate across a wide range of platforms,\u201d he added. \n  \n Good will aside, analysts said Apple may also be trying to keep federal regulators at bay. The ban on third-party tools and the uncertainty about outside ads had prompted the Federal Trade Commission to begin asking questions about Apple\u2019s approach to competition. \n  \n \u201cAt some point, Apple asked themselves whether this is doing us more harm than good, between unhappy developers and the F.T.C. sniffing around,\u201d Mr. Hammond said. \u201cFor once, Apple is being a little bit defensive in their strategy as opposed to being offensive. It just shows how the race is starting to tighten in this market.\u201d |||||", "output": "Apple has done a U-turn and scrapped restrictions introduced earlier this year on what tools developers can use to build applications for the iPhone and iPad. Developers will now be allowed to use tools based on Adobe's Flash, and restrictions on other programming languages have been lifted, the Wall Street Journal reports. Shares in Adobe jumped after the news, though iPhone and iPad users still won't be able to access Flash-based content on the Internet. Apple also addressed concerns that the application approval process is too secretive by releasing, for the first time, a list of guidelines developers should follow to avoid rejection. Analysts say the company's new-found openness appears to be a move to avoid giving an edge to the competition. \"Apple is concerned enough about the shifting tide toward Android that it feels it has to loosen restrictions to keep developers on its side,\u201d an analyst at Forrester Research tells the New York Times.", "category": "Summarization 417.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a text of many news articles seperated by special token \"|||||\".

(Associated Press) \n  \n NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Brangelina is no more. Angelina Jolie Pitt has filed for divorce from Brad Pitt, bringing an end to one of the world's most star-studded, tabloid headline-generating romances. \n  \n An attorney for Jolie Pitt, Robert Offer, said Tuesday in a statement that she has filed for the dissolution of the marriage. Offer said the decision to divorce was made \"for the health of the family.\" \n  \n Offer refused to answer questions about the divorce. \n  \n The couple has six children together: Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, and twins Knox and Vivienne. \n  \n Though together for 12 years, Pitt and Jolie Pitt only wed in August 2014. They married privately in the French hamlet of Correns in Provence with their children serving as ring bearers and throwing flower petals. They announced the ceremony days later. \n  \n This is the second marriage for Pitt, who previously wed Jennifer Aniston. It's the third for Jolie Pitt, who was previously married to Billy Bob Thornton and Jonny Lee Miller. \n  \n Though their initial romance \u2014 begun after the pair starred together in 2005's \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\" \u2014 sparked an avalanche of tabloid interest, Jolie Pitt and Pitt settled into their own unique kind of globe-trotting domesticity. \n  \n The pair adopted children from Cambodia, Vietnam and Ethiopia. And they sought to direct the glare of their celebrity toward other causes. Jolie Pitt, a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations, became an outspoken voice for refugees and various causes in Africa, as well as for breast cancer treatment after undergoing a double mastectomy. \n  \n Jolie Pitt also launched herself as a film director. Last year, the couple starred together in her \"By the Sea,\" playing a glamorous couple vacationing together in France while their marriage was on the rocks. It made a mere $538,000 at the box office. \n  \n In a 2014 interview with The Associated Press, Jolie Pitt said playing a couple with marital problems was cathartic. \n  \n \"It almost makes you get past those issues because you can laugh at them,\" Jolie Pitt said. \"You do a film about bad marriage and you witness that behavior. You study it, you let it out, you attack each other and then you just want to hold each other and make sure you never behave that way.\" ||||| Jennifer Aniston and Angelina Jolie were \u201cdumped at the same time,\u201d reveals In Touch. The magazine reports Aniston \u201claid into\u201d Justin Theroux after their disappointing at-home one-year anniversary celebration. A source says, \u201cShe called him out for being a grump all week and for ruining what should have been a blissful time together,\u201d prompting Theroux to call it quits and leaving Aniston \u201cdevastated.\u201d As for Jolie, the publication reveals Brad Pitt \u201cwalked out\u201d on her when she \u201cwent nuclear\u201d after watching his love scenes with Marion Cotillard in the trailer for Allied. A source says the trailer \u201csent Jolie over the edge,\u201d and an argument ensued, during which she was also furious that Pitt was back in touch with Aniston. Now, notes In Touch, Pitt is \u201cdone\u201d with his marriage. While all very dramatic, neither Jolie nor Aniston have been \u201cdumped\u201d by their respective spouses. A rep for Aniston exclusively tells Gossip Cop, \u201cThey are insane at In Touch.\u201d And a Pitt-Jolie insider also says the report is untrue. Sadly, Gossip Cop is not surprised by the falsity of the tabloid\u2019s latest tale. In the last few months, Aniston\u2019s rep denied the magazine\u2019s June cover story that wrongly alleged she was pregnant, and a spokesperson for Pitt exclusively told Gossip Cop the outlet\u2019s claim in July that he and Jolie were adopting a seventh child from Africa was also inaccurate. \n  \n Keeping Up With The Kardashians\u201d is being canceled, according to the new edition of Star magazine. The publication reports that while Kris Jenner is \u201cscrambling\u201d to save the show from the chopping block, \u201cnot everyone in the fame-obsessed family is upset\u201d about the cancelation. An insider tells the magazine, \u201cKris is absolutely desperate to save the show. But she can\u2019t do that without her kids, and hardly anyone in the family wants to keep doing it.\u201d \u201cThe show has turned into a grind for the kids,\u201d explains the outlet\u2019s source. Kim Kardashian\u2019s husband Kanye West, notes Star as an example, is \u201cencouraging the mom of two to move on\u201d from the series. So, when\u2019s the last episode of \u201cKeeping Up With The Kardashians\u201d going to air? Not for a long time. The show is not being canceled, Gossip Cop has learned. A rep for Kim Kardashian exclusively tells us the tabloid\u2019s story about the E! show being canned is 100 percent \u201cfalse.\u201d Interestingly, the magazine made this same inaccurate claim in a March 2014 cover story that read, \u201cKardashians Canceled.\u201d The allegation wasn\u2019t true then, and it remains wrong today. \n  \n Jennifer Garner\u2019s going to divorce Ben Affleck out of \u201crevenge\u201d? That\u2019s what Life & Style reveals in its latest issue. The publication reports that after Affleck recently let her and the kids down again, Garner\u2019s been \u201cpushed over the edge\u201d and will leave him for good. So, what happened that\u2019s causing Garner to take \u201csteps to wipe him from her life once and for all\u201d? The magazine says after their three kids spent all day decorating the backyard of the family\u2019s L.A. mansion for his birthday, Affleck was a no-show and only returned home the next day, blaming work for keeping him away. Now, Garner is \u201cgetting the ultimate revenge,\u201d reports the magazine. An insider says Garner \u201cwants Ben out of the house,\u201d and has \u201cdecided to finally file divorce papers.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s absolutely done with giving him any more chances\u2026. She\u2019s getting revenge on Ben by going through with the divorce,\u201d adds the outlet\u2019s source. There are a few problems with the Life & Style story, Gossip Cop can report. For starters, there were never plans for a birthday party in California, and Affleck never flaked on his kids. The family actually celebrated his birthday all together on a vacation in Montana. A source close to the situation exclusively tells Gossip Cop, \u201cThey just spent a lovely birthday weekend together with family and friends.\u201d Our impeccable insider mockingly adds that the same publication reported earlier in the year that \u201cthey were pregnant; so can we really trust them?\u201d \n  \n \u00a9 FRANCIS SPECKER/Press Asscociation Sofia Richie, left, and Nicole Richie at the taping of the CBS television special \"ACM Presents: Lionel Richie and Friends in Concert\" at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on April 2, 2012. Nicole Richie told her little sister Sofia to \u201cditch\u201d Justin Bieber because he\u2019s a \u201cbad influence,\u201d reveals OK!. In fact, the magazine notes Nicole is \u201cbegging\u201d Sofia to \u201ccut things off\u201d with Bieber. According to a source, Nicole \u201csees through Justin,\u201d and knows he likes to \u201cbounce around from girl to girl.\u201d \u201cNicole is really worried [Sofia\u2019s] going to get hurt,\u201d because the younger Richie is \u201csweet and young,\u201d says the insider. The publication\u2019s source adds, \u201cNicole thinks that Justin will be a bad influence or just end up breaking her heart.\u201d Gossip Cop looked into the magazine\u2019s claims, and we\u2019ve learned that Nicole does not believe Bieber is a \u201cbad influence\u201d on Sofia, who recently turned 18. While Nicole is protective of her kid sister, she also knows Sofia is capable of handling herself. A Richie family insider exclusively assures Gossip Cop that Nicole never told Sofia to \u201cditch\u201d Bieber. Our source says the tabloid\u2019s claim is \u201cnot true\u201d and a conversation like that \u201cdid not happen.\u201d Of course, OK! hasn\u2019t exactly been known for having accurate Richie sources. Gossip Cop busted the tabloid nearly a year ago when it wrongly reported Nicole and her husband Joel Madden were on the verge of divorcing. Much like that story, the current claim about Nicole warning her sister Sofia about Bieber is similarly false. ||||| Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) \n  \n Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) \n  \n Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) \n  \n Angelina Jolie has filed for divorce from Brad Pitt after learning he was cheating on her with his sexy co-star, a well-placed source told The Post on Tuesday. \n  \n \u201cShe hired a private eye because she felt that he was fooling around with her on the set, and it turns out, he was.

Most of us ignore it. \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n But what if they get it right? \n  \n In May, Hollywood Life, a noted gossip rag, ran a story that claimed Pitt was stepping out of his marriage and having an affair with his \u201cFive Seconds of Silence\u201d costar Marion Cotillard. \n  \n \u201cFor a while, the excitement of getting married masked their troubles,\u201d Hollywood Life reported of Jolie and Pitt at the time, \u201cbut lately, they\u2019ve been having explosive fights. Neither of them is sure that they can or should, hang on anymore.\u201d \n  \n The tabloid claimed that a friend of the couple said that Jolie\u2019s behavior was driving Pitt away. The insider claimed that Jolie \u201cbarely eats, she guzzles wine every night and she smokes constantly,\u201d adding that for Pitt, \u201cit\u2019s been hard to watch the woman he loves waste away.\u201d \n  \n RELATED: Twitter pulls Jennifer Aniston into the Brad and Angie breakup news with the most hilarious memes \n  \n The story reported that Pitt denied any relationship with Cotillard other than a professional one. \n  \n Shortly after the news of the divorce broke, Page Six reported that an affair is exactly what pushed Jolie to her breaking point. \n  \n \u201cShe hired a private eye because she felt that he was fooling around with her on the set, and it turns out, he was. And that was the final straw,\u201d a source claimed. Pitt and Cotillard were reportedly spotted canoodling all over London for the last few months. \n  \n The couple has been somewhat rocky lately since Jolie reportedly dreams of leaving Hollywood to focus on her humanitarian work, but Pitt longs for the spotlight. \n  \n \u201cThe older she gets, the more serious she becomes, and she is sick of the Hollywood thing,\u201d the source said. \u201cHe wants to make movies. She doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s a fundamental difference. It\u2019s how you live your life.\u201d \n  \n No word if this rumored affair is real, but it sure seems suspicious. |||||", "output": "Those rumors you may have seen recently in the supermarket tabloids were true: Angelina Jolie has filed for divorce from Brad Pitt. TMZ confirms the news, and says Jolie filed Monday and lists the date of separation as Sept. 15. TMZ reports that there was no cheating involved (though Page Six claims Jolie busted Pitt having an affair with co-star Marion Cotillard), just a fight over how Pitt parents the couple's six children. Jolie is seeking sole physical custody of the kids, with Pitt being granted only visitation, a request TMZ calls \"significant.\" An attorney for Jolie Pitt, Robert Offer, said the decision to divorce was made \"for the health of the family,\" per AP.

Walsh... (Associated Press) \n  \n NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A Fox News contributor came forward to level more sexual-harassment allegations against deposed chief executive Roger Ailes on Monday, two days after it was revealed the network's most popular on-air personality, Bill O'Reilly, has settled multiple complaints about his own behavior with women. \n  \n O'Reilly was due to return to the air on Monday following a weekend report in The New York Times that he and his employer had paid five women $13 million to settle allegations of sexual harassment or other inappropriate conduct by Fox's ratings king. \n  \n Meanwhile, the lawyer for another woman who says she was punished for rebuffing O'Reilly's advances called on New York City's Human Rights Commission to investigate O'Reilly's behavior. \n  \n The new lawsuit against Ailes was brought by Fox's Julie Roginsky and is notable because it accuses Fox's current management of trying to cover up for Ailes. \n  \n Roginsky said Ailes, who lost his job last summer following sexual-harassment complaints he has denied, suggested she have sex with \"older, married, conservative men.\" She said Ailes would insist upon a kiss hello at their meetings, requiring her to bend over so he could look down her dress. \n  \n She was seeking a permanent role on Fox's show \"The Five.\" But after an April 2015 meeting at which she turned down Ailes' advances, he wouldn't meet with her again, and she never got the regular role, she said. \n  \n Later, she said, she was pressured to join Team Roger, a group of people who publicly defended Ailes when the first harassment complaint made public against the Fox boss was brought by Gretchen Carlson last summer. Roginsky refused. \n  \n She said that even though Fox executives knew she had her own harassment allegations against Ailes, she was never encouraged to speak to the law firm hired by Fox News parent 21st Century Fox to investigate claims against him. And she said Fox never looked into her charges. Her lawyer would not say Monday why Roginsky never contacted the firm on her own. \n  \n Roginsky said that during a meeting in December, new Fox top executive Bill Shine told her he didn't believe the allegations against Ailes until recently. But the lawsuit alleges Shine and other top Fox executives should have known about Ailes' behavior much earlier. \n  \n \"Shine and other senior executives kept Ailes' conduct secret and enabled it,\" said the lawsuit, filed in state court. \n  \n Fox News representatives did not immediately return messages for comment. \n  \n Roginsky said she believes Shine hasn't given her an opportunity for advancement in retaliation for her harassment complaint and her refusal to speak out against Carlson. \n  \n At a Los Angeles news conference Monday, lawyer Lisa Bloom detailed allegations against O'Reilly by Wendy Walsh, a regular guest on the prime-time show \"The O'Reilly Factor.\" \n  \n Bloom said O'Reilly had told Walsh he would recommend her for a paid contributor role on the network. Walsh and O'Reilly had dinner in Los Angeles in 2013, but when Walsh refused his invitation to go to his hotel room, his attitude changed and she was soon dropped from the show, according to Walsh. \n  \n Bloom was seeking an investigation by the city Human Rights Commission. A spokesman for the commission said no claim had been filed. Claims have to address activity that happened within the city's five boroughs and must be filed within one year of an alleged infraction. \n  \n Walsh said she came forward because she was told by a Times reporter that many of the women who have accused O'Reilly of harassment are bound by gag orders. She said she is not bound by any such agreement, and the statute of limitations for suing has run out. \n  \n \"Nobody can silence me because my voice is not for sale,\" Walsh said. \"Nobody can buy my voice.\" \n  \n O'Reilly said over the weekend he is vulnerable to lawsuits from people who threaten to cause him bad publicity unless they get paid. He said he had \"put to rest any controversies\" to spare his children. \n  \n O'Reilly's ratings have gone up over the past year with the intense interest in politics. Independent studies show he generates more than $100 million in advertising revenue per year for TV's top-rated cable news network. But at least one advertiser, car company Mercedes-Benz, said it was pulling its ads from the show because of the \"disturbing\" allegations. \n  \n ___ \n  \n Associated Press writer Anthony McCartney in Los Angeles contributed to this report. |||||", "output": "A Fox News contributor came forward to level more sexual-harassment allegations against deposed chief executive Roger Ailes on Monday, two days after it was revealed the network's most popular on-air personality, Bill O'Reilly, has settled multiple complaints about his own behavior with women, the AP reports.

Eric Casebolt was placed on administrative leave after a video surfaced showing him pulling a 15-year-old girl to the ground and pinning her down outside a pool party Friday night in the expansive Craig Ranch subdivision. Seconds later, he pulled his gun and pointed it at two teens who appear to try to come to her aid. \n  \n The profanity-laced seven-minute video, posted to YouTube on Saturday, had been viewed more than 4 million times by Monday. It shows white police officers trying to control black teens who had scattered as officers arrived in the neighborhood. \n  \n McKinney Mayor Brian Loughmiller said that he expects city staff and police officials to quickly conduct an investigation into the officer\u2019s actions. \n  \n \u201cI am disturbed and concerned by the incident and actions depicted in the video,\u201d Loughmiller said in a written statement. \u201cOur expectation as a City Council is that our police department and other departments will act professionally and with appropriate restraint relative to the situation they are faced with.\u201d \n  \n McKinney Police Chief Greg Conley, who declined to say what specific behavior in the video led to the investigation, said Sunday that the officer was immediately placed on leave. \n  \n \u201cAny time you confront a large group of people, it\u2019s a very dynamic situation and tensions can rise very quickly,\u201d he said. \n  \n He said three officers responded after residents and a private security officer called police to complain that several teenagers did not have permission to use the pool and had refused to leave. Several people complained that the teenagers had started fighting. \n  \n The homeowners association limits pool use to Craig Ranch residents and two guests per household. \n  \n Pointing, yelling \n  \n The department dispatched nine more officers because of the size of the crowd, Conley said. \n  \n The girl who was restrained in the video, Dajerria Becton, told KDFW-TV (Channel 4) that she followed police orders. \u201cHe told me to walk away and I did. Next thing I know I\u2019m on the ground,\u201d she said. \n  \n \u201cHim getting fired isn\u2019t enough.\u201d \n  \n Near the beginning of the video, one officer can be heard calmly speaking to several teenagers. He says, \u201cDon\u2019t take off running as soon as cops get here.\u201d \n  \n Seconds later, Casebolt can be seen grabbing one teenager\u2019s arm and pulling him to the ground. He then points to other teenagers, all black, and says, \u201cGet your asses on the ground.\u201d \n  \n Someone in the background can be heard saying, \u201cSir, sir. We just came here for a birthday party.\u201d \n  \n \u201cDon\u2019t make me [expletive] run around here with 30 [expletive] pounds of gear on in the sun \u2019cause you want to screw around out here,\u201d Casebolt tells two teenagers he orders to sit on the grass. \n  \n Moments later he grabs Dajerria after she starts to walk away from the scene. Two black teens run toward Casebolt and the girl. The officer turns and pulls out his gun, pointing it at them. Two other officers intervene before the officer turns back to the teenage girl. \n  \n In the video, Casebolt can be heard yelling, \u201cOn your face,\u201d as he pushes the girl to the ground. As he leans on the girl, he points to others standing nearby and yells, \u201cGet out of here or you\u2019re going, too.\u201d \n  \n The video also shows several teenagers sitting on the grass with their hands cuffed behind their backs. Conley said Dajerria was released to her parents. No teenagers were arrested. One adult, who was not identified, was arrested on a charge of interfering in the police investigation, Conley said. No injuries were reported. \n  \n \u2018Fairly and equally\u2019 \n  \n At a news conference Sunday at the McKinney Police Department, about a dozen people expressed frustration that the officers in the video seemed to target only the black youths at the pool party. Many said that it\u2019s another example of racism in the suburb. \n  \n \u201cWe\u2019re not here to cause a riot or be Baltimore all over again,\u201d McKinney resident La\u2019Shadion Anthony said. \u201cWe\u2019re just here to be treated fairly and equally.\u201d \n  \n McKinney attracted national attention in 2004 after the Police Department\u2019s tactics were called into question by the U.S. Department of Justice. Racial tensions between police and residents in an east-side neighborhood escalated following four execution-style slayings earlier in the year. \n  \n About 75 percent of McKinney residents are white, and about 10 percent are black, according to 2010 census data. \n  \n But some say the incident Sunday wasn\u2019t racially motivated. \n  \n \u201cThis is not a racist neighborhood,\u201d said Ben\u00e9t Embry, a local radio personality who lives in the area and witnessed the incident. \u201cThere are a lot of good people in this community. It\u2019s unfortunate that an event like this brings the spotlight.\u201d \n  \n Embry, who is black, said he appreciated the police officers\u2019 speedy response in calming a rowdy situation. \n  \n \u201cThat\u2019s what they are supposed to do: protect us. I don\u2019t know any other way he could have taken her down or established order,\u201d he said. \n  \n Embry said that teenagers who do not live in the neighborhood started jumping over the fence to get to the party and were causing a disturbance. He said Dajerria was talking back to Casebolt. \n  \n \u201cShe\u2019s bringing more stress into an already volatile situation,\u201d Embry said. \u201cOut of a hundred kids, you probably had seven who are acting the fool. They totally spoiled it for everybody else.\u201d \n  \n But others, in McKinney and online, said the officers appeared to unfairly target black teens. \n  \n Lincoln Turner, who is white, attended Sunday\u2019s news conference at the police station to show support for the teenagers at the pool party. He and his children frequently use the pools at Craig Ranch, though they don\u2019t live in the subdivision. He said he doesn\u2019t want this incident to be what people remember about McKinney. \n  \n \u201cEveryone should come to McKinney and have fun in our pools. That\u2019s the message that we want to send to the world,\u201d Turner said. \u201cNot that they\u2019re going to get harassed and patrolled and beaten down. Not get a gun drawn on them. That\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d \n  \n Derrick Golden, pastor at The New Covenant Fellowship Church, urged people to not jump to conclusions until the incident has been fully investigated.

He also pulled out his gun and pointed it at other teens and briefly ran after them before being stopped by two fellow McKinney police officers.

His case represents only the third known conviction in U.S. history for a government official or contractor providing classified information to the press. \n  \n  \n  \n And it reflects a surprising development: President Barack Obama\u2019s Justice Department has taken a hard line against leakers, and Obama himself has expressed anger about disclosures of national security deliberations in the press. \n  \n  \n  \n \u201cI think it\u2019s remarkable,\u201d said Gabriel Schoenfeld, a fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute who urged prosecution of The New York Times for publishing details of the Bush administration\u2019s warrantless wiretapping program in 2005. \u201cThis is the administration that came in pledging maximum transparency. Plugging leaks is ... traditionally not associated with openness.\u201d \n  \n  \n  \n \u201cThey\u2019re going after this at every opportunity and with unmatched vigor,\u201d said Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists, a critic of government classification policy. \n  \n  \n  \n Last month, the Justice Department reissued a Bush-era grand jury subpoena against New York Times reporter James Risen for the sources he relied on in a chapter of his 2006 book, \u201cState of War,\u201d which focuses on a CIA-led ruse to disrupt Iranian nuclear weapons research. Risen has vowed to fight the subpoena but might face the possibility of jail time for contempt if a judge refuses to step in. \n  \n  \n  \n \u201cI was extremely surprised that the Risen subpoena was reinstituted. That struck me as a battle that no one needed to have,\u201d said Hearst Corp. general counsel Eve Burton, a veteran of legal battles over press sources. \u201cI thought Eric Holder would be a more moderating force in that regard.\u201d \n  \n The Justice Department also obtained an indictment last month of former National Security Agency official Thomas Drake in connection with leaks that apparently led to a Baltimore Sun series on alleged mismanagement of an NSA program to process large volumes of intercepted data. Drake has pleaded not guilty. \n  \n  \n  \n \u201cIf Thomas Drake is convicted and sentenced to jail, this will be the first president to send two leakers to prison in his term in office. That\u2019s never happened before,\u201d said Schoenfeld, author of the book \u201cNecessary Secrets.\u201d \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have expected the Holder Justice Department to be particularly hawkish in these matters.\u201d \n  \n  \n  \n No one has suggested that the moves were directed by the White House, but Obama has repeatedly let subordinates know that he is deeply troubled by leaks on sensitive national security matters like Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as administration infighting on more mundane issues. \n  \n  \n  \n \u201cObama had one pet peeve that could make him lose his cool ... leaks,\u201d Newsweek\u2019s Jonathan Alter wrote in his new book, \u201cThe Promise.\u201d According to Alter, Obama was \u201cfearsome\u201d on the subject and went on an \u201canti-leak jihad\u201d over some disclosures. \n  \n  \n  \n In November, after leaks of a key Pentagon strategy memo and classified State Department cables on Afghanistan, top administration officials said the nation\u2019s counterintelligence czar, Robert Bear Bryant, had been tasked with drafting a new strategy to combat classified leaks. \n  \n  \n  \n Some experts said the administration and the Justice Department may be trying to appease the intelligence community after angering many by releasing the so-called torture memos and by reopening inquiries into alleged torture by CIA personnel. Others said intelligence personnel are terrified by outlets like Wikileaks, on which classified information can be posted without any meaningful chance for officials to argue for the withholding of details that could damage U.S. intelligence efforts. \n  \n  \n  \n \u201cWe are in a new world,\u201d said Lucy Dalglish of The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. \u201cAt least when you have a leak to the mainstream media, you know there\u2019s a little judgment and training there. ... You have some opportunity to try to talk people out of revealing information that shows sources or methods.\u201d \n  \n  \n  \n Asked about the series of cases, one official said Monday: \u201cThe Justice Department has always taken these matters seriously.\u201d \n  \n At Wednesday\u2019s hearing, U.S. District Court Judge Alexander Williams Jr. imposed the 20-month sentence that had been agreed on as part of a plea bargain between prosecutors and Leibowitz\u2019s defense. \n  \n  \n  \n \u201cIt was a very, very serious offense,\u201d Williams said. However, in an unusual admission, Williams went on to say that while he assumed that the disclosures had a serious impact on national security, he really didn\u2019t know because he wasn\u2019t privy to what information was disclosed and what impact it had. \n  \n  \n  \n \u201cThe court is in the dark,\u201d the judge said. \u201cI\u2019m not a part and parcel of the intricacies of that. ... I don\u2019t know what was divulged, other than some documents.\u201d \n  \n  \n  \n In his statement at the sentencing, Leibowitz also shed little light on what he leaked, though he said he was trying to bring to light something he considered illegal. \n  \n  \n  \n \u201cThis was a one-time mistake that happened to me when I worked at the FBI and saw things that I considered a violation of the law,\u201d said Leibowitz, who has also worked as a lawyer in the U.S. and Israel but has now been suspended from the New York bar. \n  \n  \n  \n \u201cI should not have told a reporter about this,\u201d he said, adding that he instead should have reported the matter to an agency inspector general. \n  \n  \n  \n Assistant U.S Attorney Steven Dunne defended the sentence at a brief sentencing hearing Monday afternoon in federal court in Greenbelt, Md. \u201cThe government felt that a significant period of incarceration was proper and appropriate. Mr. Leibowitz worked for the FBI, and he betrayed the FBI when he worked there,\u201d Dunne said. \n  \n  \n  \n But such cases are relatively rare. \n  \n  \n  \n In 1985, Navy analyst Samuel Morison was convicted of providing spy satellite photos to Jane\u2019s Defence Weekly. Media organizations strongly protested, but an appeals court upheld the conviction. Morison was sentenced to two years in prison but was paroled after eight months. \n  \n  \n  \n In 2005, Pentagon analyst Larry Franklin pleaded guilty to a conspiracy to disclose classified information about Iran and other matters to pro-Israel lobbyists, foreign officials and the press. Franklin was initially sentenced to more than 12 years in prison, but a judge later cut the term to 10 months of community confinement. \n  \n  \n  \n In an unprecedented twist, two employees of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee who allegedly received some of the leaks were also charged criminally, but the Justice Department eventually dropped the case. ||||| A Silver Spring man who worked as a linguist for the FBI was sentenced Monday to 20 months in prison for leaking secret documents to a blogger. \n  \n But federal prosecutors in Maryland have remained mum about exactly what was contained in the classified papers that Shamai K. Leibowitz, 39, gave the unnamed blogger in April 2009, while he worked on contract for the FBI. According to court records, the documents concerned \"communication intelligence activities.\" \n  \n During a Monday hearing in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt, Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven M. Dunne said Leibowitz \"betrayed the FBI when he worked there,\" but offered no details. \n  \n U.S. District Judge Alexander Williams Jr. said the response of federal authorities convinced him Leibowitz committed a \"very, very serious offense.\" But the judge said even he does not know what information Leibowitz, a Hebrew scholar, disclosed. \n  \n \"I don't know what was divulged, other than some documents, and I don't know how it's compromised things,\" Williams said in court. \n  \n Leibowitz, who worked as a lawyer in Israel and has dual U.S. and Israeli citizenship, said in court papers that he worked for the U.S. State Department in 2006, teaching Hebrew and Israeli law and culture to American diplomats. He said he then was hired as a contractor by the U.S. Department of Defense at its Defense Language Institute. \n  \n According to court papers, Leibowitz worked on contract for the FBI from January through August 2009. \n  \n In court Monday, Leibowitz said he made a mistake. But he said that, at the time he revealed the classified information, he believed the documents showed a \"violation of the law.\" He said he should have pursued other options within the government to report his concerns. \n  \n \"I should not have done what I did, and I regret it terribly,\" he said. \n  \n In a letter to Williams, Leibowitz wrote that he spent his legal career helping \"minorities, undocumented workers, refugees, and disadvantaged people.\" He said he settled in Maryland with his wife and twin children in 2004 and attended the Washington College of Law. \n  \n In 2008, Leibowitz became a lawyer in New York. He said his license has been suspended. \n  \n Leibowitz pleaded guilty in December to one count of disclosure of classified information. As part of the arrangement, he agreed to file no requests for documents concerning the investigation and to \"never disclose,\" except to those who are authorized by the government, any classified or sensitive information he learned while working for the FBI. \n  \n Several members of the local Jewish community wrote Williams to support Leibowitz, who they said is an active member of his synagogue. \n  \n The case against Leibowitz comes as the government has charged a former U.S. intelligence official with leaking secrets to the media. Thomas A. Drake, 53, a former official with the National Security Agency, is accused of sharing classified information with a newspaper reporter. |||||", "output": "A former FBI linguist who leaked to a blogger information so top secret that even the sentencing judge wasn't allowed to know what it was has been sentenced to 20 months in prison. \"I don't know what was divulged, other than some documents, and I don't know how it has compromised things,\" the judge said before sentencing Hebrew scholar Shamai Leibowitz.

\n  \n Dr Harrison has warned any move to brighten clouds above the reef is a temporary, stop-gap measure only, while the real focus needs to be on reducing carbon emissions. \n  \n \"If we don't reduce emissions then I don't think the reef really has much chance of surviving in its current configuration at all,\" Dr Harrison said. \n  \n \"At the moment, we've only experienced a little bit less than 1 degree [Celsius] of average global temperature rise. \n  \n \"So if you can imagine how badly this is affecting the reef now, at 1.5 or 2C the reef has no chance. \n  \n \"Which is why \u2014 although we wouldn't want to have to do these geo-engineering ideas and deliberately make clouds over the reef if we didn't have to \u2014 we think we need to look into this because it might be the only way to save the reef.\" \n  \n Topics: climate-change, environment, great-barrier-reef, oceans-and-reefs, science-and-technology, weather, port-douglas-4871, cairns-4870, townsville-4810, qld, australia, sydney-2000, nsw ||||| A group of Australian marine scientists believe that altering clouds might offer one of the best hopes for saving the Great Barrier Reef. \n  \n For the last six months, researchers at the Sydney Institute of Marine Science and the University of Sydney School of Geosciences have been meeting regularly to explore the possibility of making low-lying clouds off the northeastern coast of Australia more reflective in order to cool the waters surrounding the world\u2019s biggest coral reef system. \n  \n During the last two years, the Great Barrier Reef has been devastated by wide-scale bleaching, which occurs as warm ocean waters cause corals to discharge the algae that live in symbiosis with them. Last year, as El Ni\u00f1o events cranked up ocean temperatures, at least 20 percent of the reef died and more than 90 percent of it was damaged. \n  \n The Australian researchers took a hard look at a number of potential ways to preserve the reefs. But at this point, making clouds more reflective looks like the most feasible way to protect an ecosystem that stretches across more than 130,000 square miles, says Daniel Harrison, a postdoctoral research associate with the Ocean Technology Group at the University of Sydney. \u201cCloud brightening is the only thing we\u2019ve identified that\u2019s scalable, sensible, and relatively environmentally benign,\u201d he says. \n  \n Bleached corals on the Great Barrier Reef. Ed Roberts/Tethys Images | ARC Centre of Excellence Coral Reef Studies \n  \n They\u2019re one of several research groups that have started to explore whether cloud brightening, generally discussed as a potential tool to alter the climate as a whole, could be applied in more targeted ways. All the scientists involved stress that the research is in its infancy. No one has tested a system for cloud brightening at all, much less in geographically focused applications. \n  \n British scientist John Latham first proposed the idea as a potential way of controlling global warming in Nature nearly 30 years ago. The theory is that fleets of ships could spray tiny salt particles, generated from sea water, toward the low-lying marine clouds that hug the coasts of several continents. That would provide the nuclei needed to induce additional droplet formation, expanding the total surface area of the clouds. The resulting dense, white clouds should reflect more heat back into space. A 2012 study led by Latham at the University of Manchester found that the approach could offset the heating that would result if carbon dioxide doubled in the atmosphere. \n  \n The Marine Cloud Brightening Project, a collaboration between a group of Silicon Valley researchers and University of Washington climate scientists, has done the most advanced work on the idea to date. The team in Sunnyvale, California, has spent the last seven years developing a nozzle that they believe can spray salt particles of just the right size and quantity to alter the clouds. They\u2019re attempting to raise several million dollars to build full-scale sprayers, in hopes of eventually conducting small-scale field trials at some flat point along the Pacific coastline\u2014ideally a place with onshore winds, low-lying clouds, and open-minded neighbors. \n  \n The Marine Cloud Brightening Project's nozzle sprays a fine mist of tiny salt particles. JAMES TEMPLE \n  \n They\u2019re among a handful of researchers looking to conduct limited outdoor experiments to explore the feasibility and risks of such approaches (see \u201cThe Growing Case for Geoengineering\u201d). But while the prospect of using geoengineering to ease global warming on a large scale poses intractable governance issues, using the technology to address a more localized problem could be more feasible, at least politically. \n  \n Coral reefs are crucial parts of the ocean ecosystem, providing hunting grounds and homes for thousands of species. They also generate nearly $200 billion in economic value annually, through tourism, fisheries, and other activity, according to one study. Reefs, however, have been hard hit worldwide by ocean acidification, pollution, overfishing, and other environmental stresses. The Great Barrier Reef has shrunk dramatically during the last three decades. \n  \n That makes it increasingly urgent to seriously explore ways of preserving the reefs, even \u201cfairly out-there, grand schemes,\u201d Harrison says. Next month, he plans to start computer climate modeling to explore whether cloud brightening could make a big enough temperature difference to help. The group plans to collaborate on the research with the Marine Cloud Brightening Project team. \n  \n Coral reefs aren\u2019t the only ecosystem that some scientists believe might need help from geoengineering. Researchers at the University of California, the Carnegie Institution, Stanford University, and Oregon State University have begun a larger project exploring, among other things, how climate change is affecting or will affect the last remaining stands of coast redwoods. \n  \n They're the world's tallest trees, and rely on coastal fog for around half of their moisture. But Northern California fog levels have dropped more than 30 percent since the early 20th century, a decline linked to urbanization and climate change. The impact has been limited to date, but fear is growing that these old-growth stands could be wiped out if the trends accelerate. \n  \n Elliott Campbell, an associate professor of environmental engineering at UC Merced, says the group has held early talks with the Marine Cloud Brightening Project about whether the technique could generate more low-lying clouds to help feed moisture to the redwoods. \u201cIf we could artificially produce fog on summer mornings, and that could help us buy the redwoods more time as we shift to a less carbon-intensive economy, that\u2019s potentially a good thing,\u201d Campbell says. \n  \n Aerial view of a bleached portion of the Great Barrier Reef. ARC Centre of Excellence Coral Reef Studies \n  \n Ken Caldeira, a prominent climate scientist at the Carnegie Institution who has modeled the potential of cloud brightening, says the idea of localized geoengineering is worth exploring. But he\u2019s not convinced that cloud brightening could produce a substantial climate effect at such a limited level. Below a certain geographic footprint, probably around 10,000 square miles, it might be difficult to produce a big enough change in cloud density to add up to much of a difference, he says. He\u2019s specifically skeptical that it would work at the Great Barrier Reef. \n  \n \u201cI just don\u2019t think there are enough clouds of the right type there that would be susceptible to marine cloud brightening,\u201d he says. \n  \n The University of Sydney\u2019s Harrison is aware of the concerns Caldeira raises and intends to look at these issues closely in his feasibility research. But at a first pass, he believes there could be sufficient marine clouds to help preserve the Great Barrier Reef. \n  \n In any case, he hopes so, because nothing else looks particularly promising. |||||", "output": "You'd think the search for a solution to bleaching coral in the Great Barrier Reef would have scientists looking down into the ocean, rather than up at the sky. But clouds could be key to combating warming ocean temperatures blamed for the bleaching, say Australian researchers. They believe that \"brightening\" low-level clouds over the 1,400-mile stretch of coral reef\u2014boosting their ability to reflect the sun's rays back into space\u2014could \"cool the water a degree or two, which is enough to prevent most of the damage,\" Daniel Harrison of the University of Sydney tells Australia's ABC News. It could work like this: Salt particles from the ocean would be directed at the clouds, triggering more water droplets to form and thus creating larger, denser clouds. Cloud brightening was first proposed as a way to cool the planet some 30 years ago and one study claims it could offset the ensuing global warming if carbon dioxide doubled in the atmosphere, reports MIT Tech Review. But though research is ongoing\u2014one company has spent seven years developing a nozzle to shoot the salt spray\u2014trials have been few and far between. Australian researchers\u2014who stress the need to reduce carbon emissions\u2014now hope to determine, through computer modeling, if cloud brightening on a small scale would make a real difference. And there's a lot riding on the research. \"Cloud brightening is the only thing we've identified that's scalable, sensible, and relatively environmentally benign,\" Harrison says.

Write a to-do list before bed. \n  \n 2. Go to sleep. \n  \n 3. Sleep better than all the non-list-writing people you meet tomorrow. \n  \n It sounds simple, but there's evidence that it just might work. According to a small study published in the January issue of Journal of Experimental Psychology, participants who took 5 minutes to write out a to-do list before bed fell asleep more quickly than participants who wrote about tasks they had already completed. The key, according to researchers, is in mentally \"offloading\" responsibilities before bedtime, theoretically freeing the mind for sound sleeping. [How to Sleep Better] \n  \n \"We live in a 24/7 culture in which our to-do lists seem to be constantly growing and causing us to worry about unfinished tasks at bedtime,\" lead author Michael Scullin, director of Baylor's Sleep Neuroscience and Cognition Laboratory, said in a statement. \"Most people just cycle through their to-do lists in their heads, and so we wanted to explore whether the act of writing them down could counteract nighttime difficulties with falling asleep.\" \n  \n To test this hypothesis, researchers invited 57 men and women between ages 18 and 30 to spend one weeknight in a controlled sleep lab. The rules were simple: lights out at 10:30 p.m., and no technology, homework or other distractions allowed. \n  \n Five minutes before bedtime, each participant was instructed to complete a short writing exercise. Half of the participants wrote about anything they needed to remember to do in the upcoming days, while the other half wrote about tasks they had completed during the previous days. When the exercise was done, participants tucked in for bed. Researchers measured each participant's brain activity overnight using a technique called polysomnography, which records eye movement, muscle activity and other biological changes. \n  \n The researchers found that the participants who wrote to-do lists fell asleep an average of 9 minutes faster than those who wrote about already-accomplished tasks. \n  \n In fact, \"the more specifically participants wrote their to-do list, the faster they subsequently fell asleep,\" the study authors wrote. \"The opposite trend was observed when participants wrote about completed activities.\" \n  \n While 9 minutes may not seem like a lot of extra shut-eye, it's comparable to the improvement seen in clinical trials for some sleep medications, Scullin told Time magazine. A 2006 study similarly found that napping for just 10 minutes sufficiently improved participants' cognitive function and energy. \n  \n The authors acknowledged that the new study could be improved by a larger sample size and more data taking each participant's personality and propensity for anxiety into account. Still, the paper's findings are consistent with other published research on the therapeutic power of keeping a journal. Previous studies have observed that expressive writing \u2014 writing about emotions and stress for 20 minutes a day \u2014 was linked to boosted immune function in patients with illnesses such as asthma, arthritis and HIV/AIDS. Other studies have drawn a line between journaling in times of stress or emotional hardship and stress relief. \n  \n So, give writing before bed a try \u2014 and hope it's boring enough to put you to sleep. \n  \n Originally published on Live Science. ||||| Are you a fan of to-do lists?

While one group was asked to write down everything they needed to remember to do the next day or over the next few days, the other was required to write about completed tasks from previous days. Then all participants were instructed to go to bed right after those five-minute writing sessions. \n  \n After analyzing the results, they found that those who wrote to-do lists fell asleep an average of 9 minutes faster than those who jotted down things they already finished. \n  \n \"The more specifically participants wrote their to-do list, the faster they subsequently fell asleep,\" the study authors wrote. \"The opposite trend was observed when participants wrote about completed activities.\" \n  \n The scientists noted their study was small and could be improved with more subjects.

Marclay\u2019s impeccably edited mashup seems to be about everything at once: life, death, art, memory, and above all the inexorable passage of time.

Andy Serkis\u2019 performance, working (literally) hand in glove with advances in performance-capture technology, definitively established the mo-cap technique as an exciting new art form.

Here is a comparison of sounds from 2004 through 2014 showing the drastic effects of the drought on our local ecology. ||||| Bernie Krause has noticed a decline in the sounds of water in Sugarloaf Ridge State Park. Photo: Eugene Kim/Flickr \n  \n Morning comes bright and dry to the Mayacamas Mountains on the eastern edge of Sonoma County, near the heart of Northern California wine country. Bernie Krause, a 77-year-old pioneer in the field of soundscape ecology, has been up for hours, sitting at his favorite spot in Sugarloaf Ridge State Park, his ears tuned to the awakening day. What he\u2019s hearing is absence, the quiet of loss. \n  \n Krause is nestled in a valley, surrounded by scrub vegetation, oak trees, and alders. One hundred paces to his right, a tripod mounted with microphones stands in a shrinking patch of shade cast by thirsty oaks and alders. Fifty paces to his left, the five-foot-wide bed of Sonoma Creek twists through brush, its stones coated with a fine layer of dust. Krause remembers the quick, rambunctious flow of wetter years, the silvery song of ripples and cascades. For the past few years, however, warmer days arrive earlier in the year, and vegetation cycles begin and end sooner. \u201cWhen the stream has no water because of the lack of precipitation, the stillness is eerie,\u201d he says. \n  \n Krause's spot in the Mayacamas Mountains. Photo: Bernie Krause \n  \n To the eye, the Sugarloaf site looks pretty much the same as ever, save for the parched creek hidden away in the shrubs. That\u2019s why the soundscape is so important. In Krause\u2019s words: \u201cIt tells the story more eloquently, from a different perspective.\u201d \n  \n Since 1994, Krause has visited this site each spring to record the dawn chorus of birds, always using the same gear and techniques, and always at the same times of day. His career of listening has led him on dozens of expeditions to remote, wild locales\u2014Borneo, the Arctic, the Dzanga-Sangha rainforest in Africa\u2014but throughout these travels Sugarloaf Ridge State Park has served as a kind of acoustic anchor. It\u2019s his home terrain, only 20 minutes by car from his house, a convenient place to slip away and lose himself in the layering of chirps and burbles. With the failing rains, though, the music he\u2019s come to cherish has mostly disappeared. \n  \n Sadly, disappearance is nothing new. Krause's audio archive, built over four decades, consists of more than 5,000 hours of what he calls \"whole-habitat\u201d field recordings from around the world. More than half of the habitats represented\u2014from desert buttes to tidal pools to alpine meadows\u2014are either totally silent or have been reduced over the course of his recording sessions due to impacts from logging, mining, real estate development, poaching, airplane traffic, warfare, and climate change. And, of course, climate change\u2019s little sibling: drought. \n  \n \u201cBecause the changes take place from year to year, over a long stretch of time, I really wasn\u2019t aware of what was happening,\u201d Krause says of his Sugarloaf site. \u201cIt was only when I set up the examples side by side that the changes became apparent. The impact of the drought was both astonishing and alarming.\u201d \n  \n With his colleague Almo Farina, a professor at Italy's University of Urbino, Krause is currently working on an academic paper that will turn his Sugarloaf recordings into crunchable numbers. Already, some preliminary results are emerging. The avian density (total numbers of individual birds) and avian diversity (total number of species) has declined dramatically since the early 2000s. Where there had been Brewer\u2019s sparrows, acorn and pileated woodpeckers, black-headed grosbeaks, red-shouldered hawks, wild turkeys, and a handful of other species, now only a few California towhees, dark-eyed juncos, and white-breasted nuthatches can be heard. (Why those species have weathered the drought when others haven\u2019t isn\u2019t exactly clear\u2014Krause\u2019s paper could answer that question.) Between 2004 and 2015, the site\u2019s biophony (totality of sounds produced by living organisms) dropped in level by a factor of five. \u201cIt\u2019s a true narrative, a story telling us that something is desperately wrong,\u201d Krause says. \n  \n The California drought gets a lot of press these days, as does ecological collapse in general, and the grim news can sometimes have a numbing effect on people who might otherwise be genuinely concerned. Perhaps that\u2019s the special value of Krause\u2019s work\u2014not what it tells us of the changing ecosystem, but how it tells us, how it speaks directly to our feelings, the part of each human that can be moved by a Mozart concerto or a Led Zeppelin riff, the part that exists before and beneath the intellect, that can be filled to the brim. \n  \n Krause frequently refers to our planet\u2019s diverse, evolved biophonies as \u201cthe voice of the divine.\u201d The spring of 2015, by comparison, was muted, hollow, sad, and Sugarloaf Ridge a weak mimic of its lusher self, he says. \u201cWhether or not the habitat will regain its biophonic vitality with the expected coming precipitation this winter remains to be seen,\u201d he says. \n  \n After an hour of dawn recording, the sun begins its daily climb and Krause packs up his gear. In the space where there was once a chorus of intricate textures and complex rhythms, now there is a question: What will next spring sound like? He heads down the trail. For the time being, the recording session is over. ||||| There are lots of ways to monitor natural environments. You can count animals, track temperature, measure ice thickness, use time-lapse photography. A surprisingly powerful and direct method is to listen \u2014 to record the sounds of a habitat and observe how they change over time. \n  \n The work of taking and analyzing these recordings occurs in an area of study known as ecoacoustics. It\u2019s a unique kind of discipline, with elements of both art and science, and it\u2019s this combination that drew Bernie Krause to the work nearly 50 years ago. In the late 1960s, he was a professional musician working on an album called \u201cIn a Wild Sanctuary\u201d that combined natural soundscapes with instrumentation. In the process of recording those soundscapes, Krause realized he was in the wrong line of work. \n  \n Advertisement \n  \n \u201cThey were the most beautiful sounds I\u2019d ever heard,\u201d Krause says. \u201cNo music could compare, and I decided right then and there that [recording soundscapes] was what I wanted to do with the rest of my life.\u201d \n  \n Soundscapes are the acoustic equivalent of a landscape image, explains Gianni Pavan, who studies bioacoustics at the University of Pavia in Italy, in an e-mail. They can include biological sounds (everything from birds chirping to carpenter ants rubbing their legs on their abdomens) non-biological natural sounds (distant thunder, trickling streams), and manmade sounds, like snowmobiles whipping through Yellowstone. \n  \n Over the years Krause has recorded more than 5,000 hours of audio, which is collected, in a sense, in a new book, \u201cVoices of the Wild,\u201d that can be read in coordination with a website where the audio clips are stored. The book features recordings from all over the world, from coral reefs off Fiji to the desert in New Mexico. Krause explains he finds soundscapes from Alaska to be particularly magical \u201cbecause they\u2019re so fragile and because they\u2019re so expressive and wonderful at their peak.\u201d He doesn\u2019t have any from New England, however, because he says in such a densely populated area it\u2019s hard to find places where natural sounds aren\u2019t unduly affected by human activity, like planes flying overheard or lobster boats idling offshore. \n  \n Krause\u2019s soundscapes are interesting and often beautiful. They also come with a political message. He estimates that nearly half of the habitats he\u2019s recorded have either \u201cgone silent\u201d over the last 35 years or been radically altered by human activity. \n  \n To make this point, he sent me an audio clip that compares recordings taken at Sugarloaf State Park in California in 2004, 2009, 2014, and 2015. There\u2019s an unnerving finality to the way the sounds peter out as time goes on, an effect Krause attributes to the region\u2019s prolonged drought. \n  \n Advertisement \n  \n Despite this gloomy trend, Krause remains celebratory in the way he approaches his work. Last year he debuted a symphony based on natural soundscapes and this past June a ballet for which he wrote the score premiered at the Jacob\u2019s Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass. With these projects and his book, he hopes to bring home just what we stand to lose as the environment around us recedes and changes. \n  \n \u201cWhile I\u2019m not terribly optimistic,\u201d he says, \u201cI am hopeful that we\u2019ll begin to hear the message these critters are putting out in time to do something about saving them.\u201d |||||  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-5', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 5', target_type: 'mix' }); \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-10', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 10', target_type: 'mix' }); \n  \n  \n  \n window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: 'thumbnails-c', container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-11', placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 11', target_type: 'mix' }); \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n Image 1 of / 12 Caption Close Image 2 of 12 Researchers say \"the [destructive] changes in bird habitats and behavior between now and 2070 will equal the evolutionary and adaptive shifts that normally occur over tens of thousands of years.\" Yay humans! less Researchers say \"the [destructive] changes in bird habitats and behavior between now and 2070 will equal the evolutionary and adaptive shifts that normally occur over tens of thousands of years.\" Yay ... more Image 3 of 12 Almost gone: The tricolored blackbird, once numbering in the millions, down to a fraction of that in CA.

Too quiet. \n  \n Behold, this bit over in Outside magazine, profiling the sweet, touching life and times of 77-year-old bioacoustician and soundscape artist Bernie Kraus, author of \u201cThe Great Animal Orchestra\u201d (2012), TED talker, ballet scorer, and a \u201cpioneer in the field of soundscape ecology.\u201d \n  \n Krause, last written about on SFGate back in 2007, is a man whose passion and profession has been making field recordings of the world\u2019s \u201cbiophony\u201d for going on 45 years, setting up his sensitive equipment in roughly the same places around the world to record nature\u2019s (normally) stunningly diverse aural symphony \u2013 all the birds, bees, beavers, wolves, babbling streams, fluttering wings, the brush of trees and the rush of rivers \u2013 truly, the very pulse and thrum of life itself. \n  \n One of his most favorite spots to record? Sugarloaf Ridge State Park, in the Mayacamas Mountains, in Sonoma. It\u2019s here he discovered something very disquieting indeed: The wonderfully diverse sounds of nature are no longer changing and evolving as usual. They are actually diminishing. Thinning out. And in many cases, vanishing completely. \n  \n This is the chilling news: Bit by bit, bird by bird, species by species, gurgling brook by gushing river, the song of wild nature is, in many places, falling deathly silent. The reasons? You already know: Real estate development, mining, logging, habitat destruction, climate change, drought. \n  \n Between 2004 and 2015, the [Mayacamas] site\u2019s biophony (totality of sounds produced by living organisms) dropped in level by a factor of five. \u201cIt\u2019s a true narrative, a story telling us that something is desperately wrong,\u201d Krause says. \n  \n In short: What once was a rich, varied symphony of sound has become a far more subdued chamber orchestra, with large spaces of eerie silence where there was once a vast natural racket, signifying everything. \n  \n It\u2019s not just Sonoma. The weird hush is surely spreading, becoming more and more familiar all over the world. It\u2019s not hard to figure out why: We\u2019ve successfully wiped out fully half the world\u2019s wildlife, in the just last four decades alone. Songbird populations in particular, for a variety of (mostly terrible, mostly human-caused) reasons, have been decimated all over the world. The skies just aren\u2019t as musical as they used to be. Ecosystems are sputtering, shifting violently, dying away completely, as pathways to life are being choked off. \n  \n I recently wrote about the week I spent at my family\u2019s getaway cabin in northern Idaho (\u201cEverything is on fire and no one cares\u201c), a normally pristine, sublime summertime experience, this year ominously altered by the sheer density and persistence of smoke from all the regional wildfires. \n  \n The light was different, the air charred and dry. But perhaps most disquieting of all, was the sound \u2013 or rather, the lack of it. \n  \n When the wind died down and the smoke really gathered in, the sky would turn a more sickly yellow. The birds seemed to stop singing entirely. The bees fell silent. The normally vibrant background cacophony of the natural world flattened out. It wasn\u2019t just eerie, it was psychically disturbing. You could feel the lack of healthy sound vibration in the air. \n  \n Of course it\u2019s not that way everywhere. Wildlife still teems and flourishes in many parts of the world where humankind\u2019s reach hasn\u2019t penetrated as fully; in some places, due to the self-same climate change, there is bizarre excess, abnormal surges in animal population, even as overall biodiversity continues to decline. There is perhaps too much sound in some areas, as nature\u2019s recoil to our abuses takes different forms \u2013 hurricanes, thunder, earthquakes. \n  \n But overall, the tonal shift is undeniable, and deeply unsettling: There is now less birdsong than at any time in human history. Fewer lions\u2019 roars, beehive hums, elephant rumbles, frog croakings, simply because we\u2019ve killed off so many of them, and show no signs of slowing. One by one and species by category, the orchestra\u2019s players are exiting the stage. The concert will never be over, but at this rate, it might be a very bleak final movement indeed. |||||", "output": "It's easy to look around the West and see startling signs of the region's drought. Trickier, but perhaps just as startling, is to hear signs of that same drought. Researcher Bernie Krause has made it possible thanks to decades of recordings at California's Sugarloaf Ridge State Park, reports Outside Online. He goes there every spring to the same spot with equipment he's used as a leader in the field of \"soundscape ecology,\" or \"ecoacoustics,\" which the Boston Globe describes as a blend of art and science. Over the years, a creek that runs through the park has dried up, and the sounds of wildlife\u2014or \"biophony\"\u2014have dried up along with it. By Krause's measurements, the biophony is down fivefold since 2004. He is now working with a researcher at the University of Urbino in Italy to translate his recordings into hard data for scientists. \u201cIt\u2019s a true narrative, a story telling us that something is desperately wrong,\u201d Krause tells Outside. Krause himself says he didn't realize the extent of the decline until playing recordings from previous years side by side with more modern ones.

He could not comment on what Besh intends to do with his ownership stake in the company, which for now is still named the Besh Restaurant Group. \n  \n The move came in response to an expos\u00e9 from NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune writer Brett Anderson documenting allegations of sexual misconduct and harassment from the top down at the company. \n  \n That story, posted online Saturday, shared accounts from current or former female employees at the Besh Restaurant Group describing a culture of sexual harassment. \n  \n Can't see video below? Click here. \n  \n The report cited two women who had filed complaints with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, while a number of others said they had quit over an allegedly hostile work environment. One revelation from the story was that the company, which has some 1,200 employees and a dozen restaurants, only recently created a human resources department. \n  \n In her letter to the staff Monday, White outlined a number of steps the company is taking related to sexual harassment issues. \n  \n She said it has hired an outside expert to \u201cindependently investigate whether any unreported claims exist.\u201d It also is creating an employee advisory committee that will \u201creflect the full diversity of our team members.\u201d \n  \n The company\u2019s sexual harassment policy and code of conduct are being revised, and a new employee assistance program is being developed to offer services including counseling and a confidential hotline for employees to report concerns, White wrote. \n  \n She also noted that a new employee training program, including \u201cramped-up efforts in sexual harassment training,\u201d began last week. \n  \n \u201cOur goal is to earn your trust and for you to know that we take all concerns seriously,\u201d White wrote. \n  \n Swift changes \n  \n White started at the company as a server at the CBD Italian restaurant Domenica before moving into management roles. Her elevation to the job of CEO means the company will be led by a woman as it tries to weather the scandal over harassment claims. \n  \n The fallout had already begun by Monday. Harrah\u2019s New Orleans Casino, which is home to the restaurant Besh Steak, said it was cutting ties with Besh. The casino plans to rename the restaurant, which remains open. \n  \n \u201cThe Harrah\u2019s New Orleans management team takes the harassment allegations against the Besh Restaurant Group very seriously, and to the best of our knowledge none of those allegations pertain to Besh Steak,\u201d casino manager Dan Real said in a statement. \n  \n In another move Monday, public television station WYES said it will no longer air a pair of cooking shows it produced with Besh. \n  \n \u201cIn view of the numerous serious allegations made against John Besh and the Besh Restaurant Group and Mr. Besh\u2019s public statements, WYES will no longer air its productions featuring Mr. Besh,\u201d station President and CEO Allan Pizzato said. \u201cWYES would not want any viewers to think that broadcast of those programs represented condonation of actions of the type alleged.\u201d \n  \n The chef produced two cooking shows with WYES. \u201cJohn Besh\u2019s New Orleans\u201d is a 26-episode cooking series that first aired in 2011 and was based on the chef\u2019s cookbook \u201cMy New Orleans.\u201d A second series, \u201cChef John Besh\u2019s Family Table,\u201d was released in 2013. Its 26 episodes, all filmed at Besh\u2019s home kitchen, were based on his cookbook \u201cMy Family Table,\u201d which focused on family-style meals. \n  \n The article's publication comes at a time when sexual harassment is a leading topic in the national conversation, in particular because of revelations about movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, though scandals at Uber and Google \u2014 as well as some of President Donald Trump's comments \u2014 have also elevated the topic. \n  \n The reports documented in the NOLA.com story range from complaints of a hostile work environment to specific allegations against Besh and his business partner, Octavio Mantilla. \n  \n One of the women said she had a sexual relationship with Besh that she described as coercive. \n  \n Besh, 49, who is married and has four sons, acknowledged the relationship with the woman in a prepared statement but described it as consensual. He said that he regretted his actions. \n  \n \"Since then I have been seeking to rebuild my marriage and come to terms with my reckless actions given the profound love I have for my wife, my boys and my Catholic faith,\" he said. \n  \n He also denied ignoring or encouraging a culture of harassment at his company. But in statements the company conceded some missteps, including a lack of clear complaint procedures for employees. \n  \n One of the Besh group's biggest star chefs, Alon Shaya, left the company in September; he now says he was fired for speaking to a reporter about harassment allegations. The Besh group has said the split was based on other issues. \n  \n Shaya has said he hopes to buy his namesake Shaya Restaurant from his former partners. He has filed a federal trademark request for the name; the Besh group, meanwhile, has filed a lawsuit seeking to protect its own use of that name. \n  \n Expansions, defections \n  \n Besh, a native of Slidell, is a Marine Corps veteran and a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America. He built a name for himself early in his culinary career on the north shore. In 1999, while the chef at the now-defunct Artesia restaurant in Abita Springs, he was named one of the country\u2019s best new chefs by Food & Wine Magazine. \n  \n In 2001 he opened Restaurant August as a high-end Central Business District dining destination. His first expansion came in 2003 with Besh Steak at Harrah's. \n  \n When Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005, Besh had already bought out his original investor at Restaurant August and had formed the Besh Restaurant Group with Mantilla. As New Orleans rebuilt after the storm, the company grew rapidly and emerged as a leader in the city\u2019s resurgent restaurant scene. Besh published cookbooks and became a familiar face on cable network food shows. \n  \n Besh Restaurant Group grew to a dozen restaurants and began expanding outside of New Orleans, with restaurants in Baltimore and Nashville, Tennessee. Another is under development in Houston. \n  \n The company has drawn wide acclaim. Its chefs and restaurants are regularly shortlisted for James Beard Foundation awards, a high honor in the industry, and they have won many of them in recent years. Along the way the group earned a reputation for developing rising culinary talent, and several of its chefs became partners in individual restaurants within the group. \n  \n Besh\u2019s company also has a charitable arm, the John Besh Foundation, which funds culinary school scholarships for aspiring minority chefs from New Orleans and provides other grants. Recently it has been heavily involved in disaster relief, including after this season's devastating hurricanes. \n  \n The chef himself has played an active role in events for the Archdiocese of New Orleans. He was the featured guest for a 2016 group tour of Israel organized by the Clarion Herald, the archdiocese\u2019s publication, that was dubbed a \"Journey of Food and Faith.\" \n  \n In 2016, he and his company helped launch the inaugural Olive Mass, a service held at St. Louis Cathedral and aimed at meeting the spiritual needs of people working in the hospitality industry. The second Olive Mass was celebrated on Sept. 25. \n  \n A spokesperson for the archdiocese said it has no upcoming events planned with Besh and had no comment on the latest reports about his company. \n  \n John Besh, Alon Shaya split heading to court over trademark name The split between chefs Alon Shaya and John Besh has moved from the dining room to the courthouse. ||||| As chef John Besh built his company into more than a dozen restaurants and 1,200 employees, the Besh Restaurant Group lacked a professional human resources department to handle employee complaints. That was among the problems mentioned by 25 women who said they were sexually harassed while working for the Besh Group in an investigation by NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune. \n  \n Interviews Monday (Oct. 23) with other New Orleans food companies suggest the Besh Group was an anomaly in lacking a formal HR structure among companies of similar size -- and even some smaller. \n  \n Besh on Monday (Oct. 23) stepped down from his role as head of the company, which he co-owns. Company representatives have said they are establishing a human resources structure, and BRG's first-ever HR director took the post Oct. 11. \n  \n Yale law professor Vicki Schultz, who wrote an influential 1998 article calling for a broader legal definition of sexual harassment, said most companies of BRG's size understand that the courts have read federal discrimination law to encourage companies to set up human resources departments to police themselves - and that the law looks less kindly on companies that don't. \n  \n \"It's kind of surprising that a company in this day and age, with so many employees, wouldn't have that kind of system set up,\" Schultz said. \n  \n Several New Orleans-area restaurant group owners or representatives said Monday their companies have had designated executives in human resources roles. Some, like Ralph Brennan, said they'd had someone in the position for years. \n  \n \"It's been so long, I can't remember\" when he first hired someone for HR, said Brennan, whose eponymous restaurant group includes Red Fish Grill, Brennan's, Napoleon House and other establishments. In total, Brennan's company employs about 700 people. \n  \n Dickie Brennan and Co. -- which includes Palace Cafe, Dickie Brennan's Steakhouse, Bourbon House and Tableau -- has three member of the human resources department among its roughly 600 employees, according to its representative, Wesley Noble. \n  \n A third company with Brennan family ties, the Commander's Family of Restaurants, which includes Commander's Palace, Brennan's Houston, Cafe Adelaide and SoBou, also has had an HR department \"for years,\" according to representative Samantha Fritz. It wasn't immediately clear how many people comprise that department. \n  \n Liz Goliwas, a public relations professional who represents both Creole Cuisine Concepts (which includes Broussard's, Kingfish and Bombay Club) and, separately, Donald Link's Link Restaurant Group (including Cochon, Herbsaint, Peche, Calcasieu, La Boulangerie and Cochon Butcher) said both companies have at least one HR employee on staff. \n  \n Goliwas said Creole Cuisine Concepts has had someone in the role since about 2006, and Link's company has had someone for about a year. \n  \n \"It just seemed a natural progression,\" said Darryl Reginelli, remembering when his pizza chain, Reginelli's, carved out an HR position about a decade ago. Today, the company, which he said has two staff-members dedicated to HR, has about 350 to 400 employees. \n  \n Taste Buds, which operates Zea, Semolina and Taste Buds Catering, also said it has an HR department, comprised of an HR director and a benefits administrator, company representative Nancy Jeansonne said in an email. Jeansonne also noted \"area managers and operations personnel are trained to handle issues as well. It's part of our culture.\" The company has about 600 employees in total. \n  \n One of the biggest names to come out of the New Orleans culinary scene -- Emeril Lagasse -- also has an HR staff, according to his company representative, Maggie McCabe. The restaurant group, which employees about 1,000 people over several states, has six people dedicated to human resources. \n  \n Carolyn D. Richmond, a New York employment lawyer who works almost exclusively in the hospitality industry, said it was still relatively rare for even large restaurant groups to employ a human resources manager in the early 2000s. Those norms have changed significantly in the last 5-10 years, she said. \n  \n \"If you're not operating with an HR department now, and you have more than 100 employees, you're asking for trouble,\" Richmond said. \n  \n Robert LeBlanc, who co-owns Cavan, Sylvain, Meauxbar and Barrel Proof under the LeBlanc and Smith banner, said the Besh Restaurant Group story has prompted his team, which does not currently employ someone for HR purposes, to reconsider its staffing. \n  \n \"We're looking at outsourcing that role and, if not, bringing someone in,\" LeBlanc said, noting his company's 120 to 150 employees represents about 1/10th the size of BRG. \"Reading that article -- you realize how important it is.\" \n  \n BRG's first director of human resources, Dawn Peterson Hazen, began at the position Oct. 11, a BRG spokesman said. She will help to implement a new orientation program called Human Resources 101. Besh and BRG's general counsel, Raymond Landry, said in September that company managers had already started the program and that every employee would ultimately be required to go through it. A Besh Group spokesman said that \"a significant portion of the program addresses sexual harassment related concerns.\" \n  \n NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune restaurant critic Brett Anderson contributed to this report. \n  \n - - - \n  \n Chelsea Brasted is a metro columnist covering the New Orleans area.

Kuhl, an assistant attorney general who is representing the state. \n  \n Lawson called Kuhl's addendum, \"as defined by the Copper and Lead rule,\" an \"interesting dodge.\" \n  \n Kuhl then restated: \"Unfiltered tap water that came from the Flint water supply is safe to drink,\" but added that no matter where your water comes from, or how well it's treated, there is still \"some risk of contamination.\" \n  \n According to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, lead in the Flint water supply has dropped below the \"action level\" of 15 parts per billion. \n  \n If the water is now safe, why then, haven't officials told residents they can stop using filters? asked plaintiff attorney Dimple Chaudhary of the Natural Resources Defense Council. \n  \n \"We are still concerned about the lead service line removals and how that will impact the system,\" the attorney said when asked the question by Lawson. \"We are still recommending residents don't drink unfiltered water.\" \n  \n Kuhl said it's a \"political decision\" and not a \"water compliance decision.\" \n  \n Kuhl said residents should continue to only drink filtered water out an \"abundance of caution,\" and because while the lead delivery lines are being replaced -- an effort that could take three years -- there is a chance backwash could cause lead levels to spike. \n  \n And \"we realize there has been a loss of trust in the city,\" he said. \n  \n The judge asked Kuhl if he had personally consumed Flint water since it's become \"safe.\" The attorney said he hadn't visited Flint in months. \n  \n \"The force of your argument might be enhanced if you actually did take a trip,\" Lawson responded. \n  \n Kuhl said he plans to take a trip to Flint sometime soon with his wife and son to visit a Titanic artifacts exhibit at the Sloan Museum. He'd drink the water at that time. \n  \n Lawson later joked they could create the \"Kuhl Rule\" to determine the water safety. \n  \n The purpose of the hearing was to argue whether Lawson should grant a defense motion to lift a November injunction requiring the state and city of Flint to verify residents' faucet water filters are properly installed, and to deliver bottled water to those homes where that can't be verified. \n  \n State officials claim they're using an optimal water delivery system, complying with EPA and MDEQ guidelines and now have lead level testing equal to or below levels in thousands of other water systems across the nation. \n  \n The plaintiffs in the case, who include the National Resources Defense Council, American Civil Liberties Union, Concerned Pastors for Social Action and others, filed a second motion claiming the state hadn't lived up to the requirements established in by Lawson, and the judge appeared to agree, although he took both motions under advisement. \n  \n Lawson accused the state of \"slow-walking\" progress toward compliance with the order he issued 2 1/2 months ago and said he was \"unimpressed\" by the efforts. \n  \n Assistant Attorney General Michael F. Murphy was peppered with questions about how the door-to-door effort ensures all homes have been inspected for filters. \n  \n He said there are currently 87 employees of with the Community Outreach Resident Education (CORE) Program, the entity doing the work, and nearly 34 still in training. \n  \n Lawson seemed annoyed it took officials nearly two weeks after his initial order to post job openings. The goal is to hire a total of 180 employees, Kuhl said. \n  \n Murphy said CORE employees had visited 39,000 homes in about five months, but must return to 28,000 residences where residents weren't available, or where crews were otherwise unable to inspect. \n  \n Murphy told Lawson the workers would ask residents if they had filters, but weren't necessarily insisting on inspections in cases where they were already installed. \n  \n \"Do you not think that flies in the face of my order?\" Lawson asked. \"If you don't make an effort, then you haven't complied with the order.\" \n  \n Kuhl then stepped up to the podium and whispered something into Murphy's ear. Murphy then amended what he'd previously said and claimed workers are insisting on performing inspections, even if residents say they already have filters properly installed. \n  \n For residents who do not have filters, Lawson ordered officials to start a bottled delivery service. \n  \n \"They are gathering data,\" Murphy said. \"Right now, there is no organized plan of delivery for delivery of bottled water.\" \n  \n Defense attorneys said the \"sophisticated\" and \"massive logistical\" effort required to deliver bottled water within the judge's order was \"hopelessly unlike anything the city has ever done.\" \n  \n Attorneys for both sides are currently in mediation. Chaudhary said there are plans for mediation sessions this coming Friday and Saturday. \n  \n In the meantime, Lawson demanded a more specific plan of compliance be produced by next week. \n  \n He asked for benchmarks on hiring targets, daily home-visit quotas, bottle delivery options, possible vendors and cost, \"typical things that one would expect.\" ||||| Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE FLINT WATER CRISIS Spokesman says Gov.

And it was also the beginning of the Flint water crisis, another tragic chapter in the tumultuous history of Michigan's once-thriving industrial center. \n  \n Though Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder touted the efforts made to heal Flint - \"we've made progress, but our work is not done,\" he said Tuesday during his State of the State address in Lansing - city residents are still unable to drink tap water without a filter due to the lead contamination that began when the water supply was switched that day in 2014. \n  \n Snyder mentioned Tuesday that more than 600 lead pipes in Flint have been replaced and that \"we look forward to working with the city on accelerating the progress of that.\" There are still thousands of lead pipes to go. \n  \n In other words, the struggle is far from over. And there are still plenty of ways you can help. \n  \n Buy Photo The 3-year-old girl in this photo, Marlana Bowen, has lived nearly her entire life without clean tap water, which means her mother, Ivory Gipson, 44, has to wash her in the sink of their home.

The bad news: You still shouldn't drink it. That was the message from Michigan officials Tuesday after the Department of Environmental Quality announced lead levels in Flint's water have fallen below the federal limit of 15 parts per billion, based on tests from homes with lead-tainted pipes or service lines conducted over six months. However, those lines still pose issues, officials say, advising residents to continue to use water filters or consume bottled water. Mayor Karen Weaver tells the New York Times there are still 20,000 lead-tainted pipes in Flint, with 6,000 expected to be removed by the end of the year. It could take three years for all pipes to be replaced, reports MLive. \"Once those lead pipes are replaced \u2026 then hopefully the people of Flint will regain the trust that has been shattered in their drinking water,\" a pediatrician who helped expose the water crisis tells the Washington Post, describing federal lead limits as \"weak.\" For now, \"it is nowhere near the end of the story.\" Under a judge\u2019s order, officials are required to check that Flint residents have water filters properly installed. A bottled water delivery is also to be set up for those without filters, though lawyers for the state say that would require a \"massive logistical\" effort.

The team of researchers looked carefully at the numbers occurring before and after 1994, when Denmark \u2018s health system expanded the definition of autism to include a wider array of symptoms. In 1995, the national health registries started tracking outpatient autism diagnoses in addition to those who were admitted to a healthcare facility, Forbes reports. After 1995, the autism rate ballooned. \n  \n \u201cLikely, the effect of diagnostic changes is similar between Denmark and the U.S., although we don\u2019t really have side-by-side studies of which I\u2019m aware to prove that,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cThe effect of awareness and early detection of autism spectrum disorders could well be different between the two countries.\u201d \n  \n Can these findings be applied to helping us understand the growing prevalence in autism in the United States where the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 1 in 68 children in many communities has been identified with autism spectrum disorder, roughly a 30 percent increase from the 2012 of 1 in 88 children? \n  \n \u201cThe authors have at hand a more exhaustive and thorough database than is available pretty much anywhere else, and their findings are echoed by some other studies,\u201d Glen Elliott, chief psychiatrist and medical director of Children\u2019s Health Council in Palo Alto, Calif, told Forbes. \n  \n \u201cLikely, the effect of diagnostic changes is similar between Denmark and the U.S., although we don\u2019t really have side-by-side studies of which I\u2019m aware to prove that,\u201d Elliott added. \u201cThe effect of awareness and early detection of autism spectrum disorders could well be different between the two countries.\u201d \n  \n Haelle points out in her Forbes story that diagnostic practices have definitely changed in the U.S. \n  \n The way autism is defined in the U.S. has changed dramatically since 1980, when it first appeared in the DSM-III as \u201cInfantile Autism\u201d and could only be diagnosed in children whose symptoms began before they were three years old. Autism spectrum disorders have expanded to include diagnosis without a specific age requirement beyond the \u201cearly developmental period\u201d and without requiring significant language impairment in the recently revised DSM-5. The vast majority of people diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders today would never have qualified under the 1980 classification, and no formal classification separate from schizophrenia existed before then. \n  \n As a result, Haelle says it\u2019s not surprising that autism rates are increasing in the United States. \n  \n One more important thing to note in this study: The results revealed that diagnosis practices account for 60 percent of the increase, leaving us with 40 percent that\u2019s still unexplained. We can\u2019t forget about that 40 percent. ||||| Almost two thirds of the increase in autistic Danish children results from how autism is diagnosed and tracked, found a new study in JAMA Pediatrics, lending more support to the idea that the apparent rise in autism rates, or at least most of it, is unlikely to be \"real.\" That is, the increase is likely more about previously-unidentified autistic individuals getting an autism diagnosis than more individuals actually developing autism. \n  \n Although the term \"autism\" has been around for more than a century, it didn't start taking on a meaning we would recognize today until the 1940s, and it remained linked to schizophrenia, a completely unrelated psychiatric disorder, until the 1960s. The definition has continued to expand and become more detailed, and thus autism prevalence has been adjusted accordingly over the years. \n  \n In Denmark in particular, the diagnostic criteria for autism expanded in 1994 to include a spectrum of disorders with a broader list of symptoms, thereby widening the definition of autism. Then in 1995, national data tracking began to include diagnoses made from outpatient patient visits rather than just diagnoses of those admitted to a healthcare facility. Since every Danish resident has a complete health record maintained by the Danish government, researchers can use this national health registry to study an entire population with lower likelihood of bias from those included or excluded in a study. \n  \n By examining the health records of all children born in Denmark from 1980 through 1991 \u2013 nearly 668,000 children \u2013 the researchers determined that 60 percent of the increase in autism rates in Denmark could be attributed to those two changes in the way Danish autistic children have been counted since the mid-1990s. The change in the diagnostic criteria accounted for a third of the increase in autism, and including outpatient diagnoses in the statistics account for 42 percent of the increase. \n  \n What makes this study strong is its size, with well over a half million children born over a decade, and the use of the national health registry for the data. \"The authors have at hand a more exhaustive and thorough database than is available pretty much anywhere else, and their findings are echoed by some other studies,\" said Glen Elliott, chief psychiatrist and medical director of Children's Health Council in Palo Alto, Calif. But it's less clear, Elliott told me, how much these findings can be generalized to the U.S. Autism prevalence in Denmark, 54 of every 10,000 children, is still far lower than that of the U.S., with 147 of 10,000 children, though the latter, he said, uses a less precise tool* than direct access to patient records, as used in this study. \n  \n \"Likely, the effect of diagnostic changes is similar between Denmark and the U.S., although we don't really have side-by-side studies of which I'm aware to prove that,\" Elliott said. \"The effect of awareness and early detection of autism spectrum disorders could well be different between the two countries.\" \n  \n The way autism is defined in the U.S. has changed dramatically since 1980, when it first appeared in the DSM-III as \"Infantile Autism\" and could only be diagnosed in children whose symptoms began before they were three years old. Autism spectrum disorders have expanded to include diagnosis without a specific age requirement beyond the \"early developmental period\" and without requiring significant language impairment in the recently revised DSM-5. \n  \n The vast majority of people diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders today would never have qualified under the 1980 classification, and no formal classification separate from schizophrenia existed before then. So it's not surprising that numbers have increased in the U.S. The CDC puts the current incidence of autism spectrum disorders at 1 in 68, or about 1.5 percent,* though this figure may also mislead those unfamiliar with the broad diversity \u2013 quite literally, the neurodiversity \u2013 that autism encompasses since popular images of autism still unfortunately misrepresent the condition. The 1 in 68 refers to individuals all over the autism spectrum, from those who need only some supports and accommodations to those who need very substantial support. It is the latter group, especially those who have little spontaneous language (verbal or nonverbal) who are the stereotypical face of autism, but they are the minority of autistics. \n  \n The idea that increases in autism rates reflects changes in diagnostic definitions rather than a real change in the developmental condition's prevalence is not new. Other recent studies have found similarly that real rates of autism have not changed significantly over the past couple of decades, and a 2013 study found that identified autistic children \"clustered\" where resources for diagnosis and treatment were greater. In other words, where there's more access to diagnostic services, the autism rate is higher. \n  \n But this reality is often denied or ignored by a significant proportion of autism advocates, primarily those who subscribe to pseudoscience like that peddled at Age of Autism. They may also claim that autism does not occur at the same rates in other countries as it does in the U.S. because they don't recognize that the same diagnostic, awareness and identification issues exist just about everywhere. For example, a 2011 study in South Korea found a prevalence higher than that of the U.S. (2.6 percent, or about 1 in 38), but two thirds of the cases were undiagnosed. \n  \n However, none of this means there isn't a real increase in those affected \u2013 it's not clear yet. As Elliott told me regarding the population in this study, \"it is true that their analyses suggest that 'most' of the increase is explained by changes in diagnostic criteria and outpatient contacts, but 'most' is still only 60 percent, leaving 40 percent of their increase unexplained.\" (And that unexplained bit will also vary across countries.) \n  \n So, if there is a real increase \u2013 again, it's not clear \u2013 do we have any idea what might account for it? \n  \n Well, we know for darn sure it isn't vaccines. (Seriously, there IS NO LINK.) It's possible a small amount of the increase may relate to the increase in the average age of parents. Both women and men are becoming parents later now than at any other time in history, and autism spectrum disorders appear linked to older parents, though the data on older fathers is more solid than that on older mothers. And then there is a long, long, ridiculous list of other things linked to autism (car exhaust? labor induction? really?) that have little to no solid evidence. \n  \n \"No one has offered a convincing explanation for why an increase is occurring, if it is,\" Elliott said. \"I think most in the field believe that there is a 'real' increase that merits ongoing investigation \u2013 along with the continued search for a cause of any sort for autism, but the general consensus is that the 'real' increase is not nearly as large as the raw numbers would suggest.\" \n  \n Elliott said the possibility of other factors can't be ruled out, and researchers have continued looking for possible environmental factors. \n  \n But, \"the take-away message,\" he said, \"is that at least a significant amount of the perceived increase of autism spectrum disorders is due to changes in criteria we use to make the diagnosis and the increased awareness about autism spectrum disorders that has led both to earlier diagnoses and greater likelihood of detection.\" \n  \n *Edited: I removed statements regarding the CDC's data being based solely on parent-reported diagnoses when I was informed they used secondary methods to confirm diagnoses as well. ||||| TIME Health For more, visit TIME Health \n  \n The number of children diagnosed with autism has ballooned in recent years, but the reason for the increase is hotly debated. Some argue autism results when rare gene mutations are triggered by environmental factors like pollution, certain chemicals or even parental age. Others say it\u2019s due to the fact that we\u2019ve simply gotten much better at diagnosing it. Now, a large new study published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics suggests the primary cause of the increase of autism spectrum disorder is actually due to changes in how the disease is diagnosed. \n  \n \u201cThis study is important because it shows a large part of the increase has nothing to do with the environment, but rather administrative decisions,\u201d says study author Stefan Hansen of Aarhus University in Denmark. \n  \n The researchers followed 677,915 Danish children born between 1980 and 1991 and tracked them until they either had an autism diagnosis or reached the study end date of Dec. 31, 2011. Hansen and his team looked specifically at changes that occurred before and after the year 1994, when criteria for psychiatric diagnoses changed in Denmark so that autism became a spectrum of disorders, broadening the criteria for diagnosis. The researchers found significantly more children were diagnosed with autism in 1995 and on, and the team was able to determine that 60% of the increase could be attributed to these criteria changes. \n  \n \u201cI am not saying it explains everything,\u201d says Hansen. \u201cThere\u2019s the remaining 40%, so we shouldn\u2019t stop here.\u201d That 40% is important if researchers want to understand all the contributing factors to the disease he says. \n  \n While Hansen\u2019s findings focused specifically on diagnostic criteria changes in Denmark, other countries, including the U.S., have seen similar changes in the diagnosis of psychological and brain-development disorders. \n  \n In May 2013, the American Psychiatric Association published new guidelines for diagnosing autism spectrum disorders in what\u2019s casually referred to as the \u201cpsychiatry bible\u201d\u2014the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). Previously, children needed to meet six of 12 criteria points to be diagnosed with one type of autism-related disorder like Asperger\u2019s disorder or childhood disintegrative disorder. Now, the disorders fall under the single category of \u201cautism spectrum disorders,\u201d and the criteria needed for a diagnosis is much more specific. \n  \n Some advocacy groups like Autism Speaks were concerned the changes would mean some people wouldn\u2019t get care, with some research suggesting that a small but significant minority of kids diagnosed with autism would not qualify under the new criteria. \u201cOur concern has been that the constricting of the criteria would in fact artificially reduce the prevalence of autism,\u201d says Michael Rosanoff director of public health research at Autism Speaks. \u201cThe DSM-5 has not been in play for long enough and there\u2019s ongoing research looking at how prevalence is changing and access to services. Time will really tell.\u201d \n  \n Rosanoff and this study\u2019s researcher Hansen agree that more research is needed to understand what other factors may contribute to the rise in autism cases worldwide. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that about one in 68 U.S. kids is on the autism spectrum, which is 30% higher than estimates from as recent as 2012. \u201cSome of this has to do with increasing public awareness,\u201d says Hansen. \u201cAs people become more aware of the term autism over time, it\u2019s causing parents to have their kids be examined more often.\u201d \n  \n The CDC announced on Jan. 2 that over the next four years, it will invest over $20 million to increase tracking of children with autism spectrum disorder so that the U.S. can better understand what impacts the prevalence of autism here. With better monitoring worldwide, the hope is scientific communities and families affected by autism will better understand more about the disorder\u2019s emergence. \n  \n Read next: Most Cancer Is Beyond Your Control, Breakthrough Study Finds \n  \n The Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

In the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics, they argue that the huge jump in autism rates essentially isn't real, reports Forbes. More precisely, \"the increase is likely more about previously unidentified autistic individuals getting an autism diagnosis than more individuals actually developing autism,\" writes Tara Haelle. For one thing, the word \"autism\" hasn't been around terribly long, and until the 1960s it was linked to schizophrenia. Even as recently as the 1980s, it was described as an \"infantile\" disorder, diagnosed only when symptoms appeared before age 3. Denmark widened its definition of autism in 1994, and when the nation's health registries started tracking outpatient diagnoses in addition to those admitted to health care facilities in 1995, the autism rate soared. Similar diagnostic changes have occurred in the US, where 1 in 68 kids are diagnosed with the disorder, reports Time.

(Melissa Phillip/Houston Chronicle via AP) (Associated Press) \n  \n AUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 National Democrats breathed a sigh of relief after a liberal outsider lost her runoff in a high stakes U.S. House race for one of three Republican-held seats they hope to flip this November in the deep red state. \n  \n The most-watched race of Tuesday's Texas primary runoffs saw liberal activist Laura Moser defeated by Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, a former Planned Parenthood board member. The result was cheered by the party establishment, who saw Moser's as an unelectable drag on their chances of retaking the House. \n  \n Democrats also nominated a candidate for governor who breaks barriers but is expected to struggle to gain traction against Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in November. Lupe Valdez is the first openly gay and first Latina gubernatorial candidate in Texas. But she's faltered on the campaign trail with basic policy issues while failing to win the endorsement of some Hispanic activists because of her past cooperation with federal immigration agents while serving as Dallas County sheriff. \n  \n Both outcomes soothed party nerves in a slate of runoffs Tuesday night that otherwise unfolded with little fanfare in Texas, which remained shaken by a high school shooting that killed 10 people just as early voting ended last week. \n  \n While Democrats have few illusions of ousting Abbott in November, Valdez's win spared the party from putting at the top of their ticket Houston businessman Andrew White, a moderate who personally opposes abortion. \n  \n \"Tonight is a victory for all of us who are fighting for a stronger and fairer Texas. A tolerant and diverse Texas. A Texas where the everyday person has a voice and a fair shot \u2014 just as I had,\" said Valdez, who once picked green beans as a migrant farmworker. \n  \n In Congress, Fletcher's win was one of three Texas primary runoffs that are key to whether Democrats can flip the minimum 24 GOP-held seats they'll need to seize a House majority in November. \n  \n Not willing to take any chances, the fundraising arm for congressional Democrats worked to undercut Moser in a district that Republican John Culberson has held since 2001 \u2014 but has shifted to a more Hispanic, better educated battleground that Hillary Clinton narrowly won in 2016. \n  \n Moser made the runoff despite the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee criticizing her for writing jokingly in 2014 that she'd rather have teeth pulled than live in small-town Texas. \n  \n Susan Wright, a voter in Houston, said she thought \"Democrats in Washington really screwed up\" by attacking Moser. \n  \n \"It was too bad they decided to make it sound like someone has done a big investigative report on her. I never saw it.\" Wright said. \n  \n Guns did not appear to be a major issue in the runoff days after the shooting at Santa Fe High School outside Houston. Hours before polls closed Tuesday, Abbott hosted the first of three round table discussions this week with policymakers to discuss better fortifying schools. \n  \n But Abbott hasn't mentioned gun control and Democrats say Texas Republicans \u2014 who have a dominating majority in the state Legislature \u2014 won't dare cross the National Rifle Association by considering tighter firearm limits. Democratic candidates generally agree on gun control and there hasn't been much debate so far in the runoff races. \n  \n Two other Texas districts Democrats hope to flip are Dallas U.S. Rep. Pete Sessions', which supported Clinton instead of Trump, as did Rep. Will Hurd's, encompassing 800 miles of Texas-Mexico border from San Antonio to El Paso. Former NFL linebacker Colin Allred advanced to face Sessions and Air Force veteran Gina Ortiz Jones won to take on Hurd. \n  \n ___ \n  \n Eds: Associated Press Writer Juan Lozano contributed to this report from Houston. \n  \n ___ \n  \n Sign up for \"Politics in Focus,\" a weekly newsletter showcasing the AP's best political reporting from around the country leading up to the midterm elections: https://bit.ly/2ICEr3D ||||| Another primary, another big night for female Democratic candidates. \n  \n In Georgia, Stacey Abrams trounced her opponent and will campaign this fall to become the first female African-American governor in history. In Kentucky, fighter pilot Amy McGrath proved her naysayers wrong when she upset Jim Gray, the mayor of Lexington recruited by national Democrats. \n  \n Story Continued Below \n  \n The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee also averted the predicament it desperately sought to avoid: a Texas House hopeful whom it attacked as a surefire general election loser flamed out in the state\u2018s primary runoff. \n  \n The third multi-state primary night of the 2018 midterms featured primaries in Arkansas, Georgia and Kentucky \u2014 plus the Texas runoff. Here are POLITICO\u2019s five takeaways from the night: \n  \n The Georgia governor\u2019s race will test a risky Democratic gambit. \n  \n The primary between Abrams and state Rep. Stacey Evans was always a curiosity: two women named Stacey who had served in the state House \u2014 one black, one white. \n  \n But it also pitted two contrasting strategies against each other. Evans had argued the road back to the governorship in Georgia \u2014 the most recent Democratic governor, Roy Barnes, left office after the 2002 election \u2014 was through moderates and blue-collar white voters who supported politicians like Barnes and Zell Miller, the late former governor and senator. \n  \n Abrams is making a different bet \u2014 one that is about to be tested on a massive stage \u2014 on expanding the electorate. She\u2019s looking to register and engage more black voters, who turned out at a lower rate in the last midterm elections in 2014, when 40.6 percent of African-American voters turned out, compared with 47.5 percent of whites. \n  \n Abrams isn\u2019t the only Democrat making that argument: Progressives across the map have insisted that running to the left, especially on economic issues, could access a well of untapped voters. \n  \n But Abrams\u2019 strategy goes beyond ideology. And she\u2019ll have no shortage of surrogates with potential 2020 ambitions swinging through the emerging presidential battleground state, which Trump won by just 5 points in 2016. \n  \n It\u2019s still Democrats\u2019 Year of the Woman. \n  \n Democrats nominated Abrams, an African-American woman, in Georgia. In Texas, the nation\u2019s second-most-populous state, the party nominated Lupe Valdez, a gay Latina, for governor. \n  \n In a closely watched Democratic primary for a House seat in Kentucky, former Marine fighter pilot McGrath, a first-time candidate, defeated Gray. \n  \n Democrats chose women for two of the three Texas swing districts: Fletcher in the 7th District, and Gina Ortiz Jones in the 23rd. \n  \n Women are winning lots of Democratic Party nominations, and the party will be relying on them heavily in the fall. The latest POLITICO/Morning Consult poll, released Wednesday, shows Democrats with a 9-point lead among female voters on the generic congressional ballot, compared with a 1-point advantage among male voters. \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n It was a pretty good night for the Democratic establishment. \n  \n It took an extra 11 weeks, but the DCCC\u2019s gambit in Texas\u2019 7th District paid off. \n  \n Back in February, the party committee quietly posted a series of negative talking points about former journalist Laura Moser on its website. She\u2019s vulnerable to attacks as a carpetbagger, the online posting said. In an article she wrote for Washingtonian magazine, she disparaged other parts of Texas. (The online posting was no longer available on the DCCC\u2019s website late Tuesday night.) \n  \n Moser seized the opportunity to cast herself as an insurgent taking on the establishment, collecting campaign dollars online and surging to a second-place finish in the March 6 primary. \n  \n But her momentum stalled \u2014 not because her opponent, Lizzie Fletcher, and the Democratic establishment brandished those weapons against her. Instead, they laid off. Fletcher never really attacked Moser, and the DCCC didn\u2019t add Fletcher to its list of top recruits \u2014 as it did with two other first-place primary finishers in Texas runoffs. (Those other two \u201cRed-to-Blue\u201d candidates \u2014 Ortiz Jones in the 23rd District and attorney Colin Allred in the 32nd \u2014 won easily on Tuesday, too.) \n  \n Amy McGrath celebrates with her husband, Erik Henderson, after winning her primary in Kentucky\u2019s 6th District on May 22, 2018. | James Crisp/AP Photo \n  \n The size of Fletcher\u2019s victory \u2014 the attorney and former Planned Parenthood board member won roughly twice as many votes as Moser \u2014 also makes it more difficult for those irked by the DCCC\u2019s stance in the race to argue that the limited party intervention was decisive. \n  \n McGrath in Kentucky wasn\u2019t national Democrats\u2019 first choice. The party recruited Gray to run, even after McGrath\u2019s viral announcement video brought her big money from small, online donors. \n  \n But, as in Texas\u2019 7th, the committee never added Gray to its \u201cRed-to-Blue\u201d list. And there\u2019s no evidence McGrath will be a weaker candidate against Rep. Andy Barr (R-Ky.) in the fall than Gray would have been. In fact, the DCCC was quick to release a weeks-old internal survey produced by its analytics department showing McGrath ahead of Barr in a then-hypothetical general election matchup. \n  \n In Arkansas\u2019 2nd Congressional District, state Rep. Clarke Tucker won the nomination outright, capturing 58 percent of the vote in a four-way race. He\u2019ll be able to take the fight to GOP Rep. French Hill in a district Trump won by 10 points without first having to deal with a June runoff. \n  \n Conservatives are poised to make their mark on the Texas delegation. \n  \n Texas\u2019 GOP House delegation has long been among the most conservative in the conference, but it was poised to move farther right after Tuesday\u2019s runoff. \n  \n Six GOP members are retiring at the end of the year or have already resigned: Ted Poe, Sam Johnson, Jeb Hensarling, Joe Barton, Lamar Smith and Blake Farenthold. Five of the primary races to replace them came down to runoffs on Tuesday, with conservatives mostly winning the day. \n  \n In the 6th District, former Tarrant County Tax Assessor Ron Wright, who was endorsed by the conservative Club for Growth, narrowly defeated former Navy fighter pilot Jake Ellzey. Chip Roy, Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s former chief of staff and another Club endorsee, defeated businessman Matt McCall. Conservative activist Michael Cloud defeated Bech Bruun, whom the Club opposed, in the 27th District. \n  \n All in all, the Club for Growth \u2014 which has often clashed with congressional GOP leaders on spending and other fiscal issues \u2014 went 3-for-4 in Texas GOP runoffs on Tuesday. \n  \n Pence couldn\u2019t drag Bunni Pounds over the finish line. \n  \n The Club\u2019s only defeat in Texas was a race in which it was aligned with a cadre of bold-faced GOP names, including the vice president. \n  \n Pence \u2014 along with Cruz and Hensarling \u2014 backed Bunni Pounds, a political fundraising consultant, in the 5th District. She also had the support of an array of other conservative groups and figures, including the Tea Party Express and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the House Freedom Caucus. \n  \n But Pounds was defeated Tuesday night by state Rep. Lance Gooden, 53 percent to 47 percent. Despite the help from prominent conservatives in Texas and beyond, Pounds couldn\u2019t overtake Gooden, who finished first in the March primary. \n  \n The defeat will sting for Pence: It was the first open primary into which he\u2019s waded so far this cycle and is a minor setback in the vice president\u2019s quest to stamp the Trump-era GOP with his image. \n  \n Scott Bland contributed to this report. \n  \n  \n  \n CLARIFICATION: A previous version of this story incorrectly described Jim Gray as the former mayor of Lexington, Kentucky.

Nathan Deal, a competition that will test whether the state is truly competitive after more than a decade of GOP rule. \n  \n \u201cWe are writing the next chapter of Georgia history, where no one is unseen, no one is unheard and no one is uninspired,\u201d a jubilant Abrams said, adding: \u201cAnd I know for the journey ahead, we need every voice in our party - and every independent thinker in the state.\u201d \n  \n Abrams attracted national attention, big-name endorsements and millions of dollars in outside spending with her \u201cunapologetic progressive\u201d platform to flip the Georgia governor\u2019s office for the first time since 2002. \n  \n FOLLOW: Primary election results \n  \n RELATED: Cagle, Kemp headed to runoff for GOP nomination \n  \n ISSUES: Where the candidates for Governor stand \n  \n She overcame a stiff challenge from Evans, who tried to frame herself as the more ardent progressive. Evans fueled her campaign with nearly $2 million of her own money, pummeling Abrams with criticism for supporting a 2011 Republican-backed measure that cut awards to the HOPE scholarship. \n  \n Each of the Democratic and Republican candidates tried to carve out his or her niche in a race that attracted more than $22 million in campaign contributions \u2013 and flooded the airwaves with more than $13 million in TV ads. \n  \n Though her Republican opponent is not yet known - Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle will face Secretary of State Brian Kemp in a July 24 showdown - the Georgia GOP quickly attacked her over her financial background. \n  \n \u201cI\u2019ve tried to make sense of her personal and professional finances, and my head is spinning,\u201d said Georgia GOP chair John Watson, who called on her to release her tax returns and other financial records. \n  \n Abrams owes more than $200,000 in debts, including about $54,000 to the IRS. She has said she\u2019s on payment plan to pay back the debt, and has sought to frame her struggles as evidence she understands the problems that Georgians face. \n  \n Evans, meanwhile, quickly endorsed Abrams and vowed to help Democrats form a united front against President Donald Trump and state Republicans. \n  \n \"The Democratic party is trying to find a unified voice to rally against Trump,\u201d said Evans. \u201cWe must do that.\" \n  \n Shifting strategy \n  \n  \n  \n The Democrats largely abandoned centrist talk to appeal instead to left-leaning voters with a promise of implementing gun control, increasing financial aid for lower-income families and taking steps toward the decriminalization of marijuana. \n  \n Stacey Abrams visited the AJC to discuss her run for governor. We had three questions for her. \n  \n That\u2019s a stark contrast from more moderate appeals from a generation of Democratic candidates for governor, who often sought the National Rifle Association\u2019s endorsement and touted fiscally conservative policies. \n  \n They are echoing many in the party\u2019s base who insisted on that shift. Claudia Colichon, who lives in north Atlanta, said she demands candidates who embrace mass transit funding and fight for gun control. \n  \n \u201cThere needs to be a progressive change,\u201d said Colichon. \u201cPeople are seeing that conservative policies aren\u2019t working.\u201d \n  \n Abrams drew support from Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and a string of other high-profile Democrats and raised about two-thirds of her campaign funds from outside the state. National groups chipped in another $2 million worth of ads supporting her. \n  \n Evans mounted a lower-key campaign focused on local endorsements and smaller gatherings. The election-eve activities highlighted their differences. While Abrams held a large get-out-the-vote rally, Evans slung beers for supporters at an Atlanta bar. \n  \n United and divided \n  \n  \n  \n Both Abrams and Evans united around a host of issues, including expanding Medicaid, growing the medical marijuana program and continuing Deal\u2019s criminal justice overhaul. And both are outspoken opponents of \u201creligious liberty\u201d measures they say amount to state-sponsored discrimination. \n  \n The two attorneys also both were the products of hardscrabble childhoods that shaped their views of government, served together in the state House in their 30s and had up-close views of the tragic toll of substance abuse on their families with siblings who faced legal trouble. \n  \n But they\u2019ve clashed on other issues, including how aggressively they oppose the NRA, how they would handle the state\u2019s $26 billion budget and even how they would address Stone Mountain and other Civil War monuments. \n  \n The biggest policy divide, however, centered on the HOPE scholarship, which provides tuition aid to Georgia college students who maintain a \u201cB\u201d average. \n  \n Evans said Abrams betrayed her party by working with Republicans seeking cost-cutting moves to reduce the program\u2019s awards in 2011. Abrams countered that more \u201cseasoned\u201d Democrats sided with her in that vote because they knew negotiating with the GOP would prevent deeper cuts. \n  \n A new philosophy \n  \n  \n  \n The other central disagreement in the race involved strategy. \n  \n Evans banked on a more conventional Democratic plan to win over independent voters and moderates, particularly suburban women, who have fled to the GOP. Abrams staked her campaign on energizing left-leaning voters, including minorities who rarely cast ballots. \n  \n The two competed for support in an increasingly diverse electorate and at times racial tensions surfaced. \n  \n There was the moment last year when Abrams supporters shouted down Evans at an Atlanta conference of progressive activists with chants of \u201csupport black women.\u201d Evans, who is white, drew scorn with a video at Ebenezer Baptist Church that faded her face into the image of Martin Luther King Jr. \n  \n For Democrats, the divisive primary for governor was somewhat novel. Jason Carter, the party\u2019s 2014 nominee, faced no Democratic competition. And former Gov. Roy Barnes steamrolled over opposition in 2010 during his failed comeback bid. \n  \n The party has also largely avoided fierce primary battles between black and white candidates for governor since the 1990 vote, when then-Lt. Gov. Zell Miller trounced former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young. \n  \n Evans, who represented a Smyrna-based district, faced an uphill battle from the moment she entered the race. Black women form the largest bloc of voters in the Democratic primary, and Abrams\u2019 campaign predicted African-American turnout overall could make up 65 percent of the vote. \n  \n To make inroads, Evans staged a slate of smaller rallies and meet-and-greets, and she relied heavily on prominent black officials to spread her message. She also spent far more heavily on TV than Abrams, inundating the airwaves with a HOPE-themed pitch. \n  \n In her victory speech, Abrams moved to unite the party by praising Evans\u2019 supporters. She pledged to repeal a campus carry law, expand the HOPE scholarship, improve workforce training programs and strengthen labor unions. \n  \n And she tried to appeal to more centrist voters by saying she would be the \u201cstate\u2019s public education governor\u201d \u2013 emphasis on the word \u201cpublic.\u201d \n  \n \u201cTogether we will shape a future with a boundless belief in the historic investment of children who are at the very core of every decision we make,\u201d she said. \n  \n  \n  \n - Staff writer Ariel Hart contributed to this report. \n  \n  |||||", "output": "A historic win in Georgia has put Stacey Abrams on course to become the first black female governor in American history.

She was wearing a thong with a lace front.\" \n  \n How did the protests start? \n  \n The day after publication of that court report, the head of Dublin's Rape Crisis Centre criticised the barrister's remarks. \n  \n Although she did not question the verdict, she called for reform of a legal system in which she said such suggestions were frequently made. \n  \n Amid increasing media attention, Irish social media users expressed outrage at the remarks in court. \n  \n Skip Twitter post by @ibelieveher_ire Counsel for man acquitted of rape suggested jurors should reflect on underwear worn by the 17yo complainant.

The revelations caused controversy on both sides of the border. \n  \n What happened at the protests? \n  \n Lunchtime protests calling for an end to \"victim-blaming in the courts\" took place in a number of Irish cities on Wednesday, organised by Socialist feminist group Rosa. \n  \n In Cork, where the trial took place, an estimated 200 people gathered to march on the courthouse and lay underwear on its steps. \n  \n In the capital, supporters gathered at the Spire of Dublin, where a \"washing line\" strung between lampposts displayed women's underwear. \n  \n Other protests were set to take place in the western city of Limerick on Wednesday, and Waterford in the south-east on Friday. ||||| Get daily updates directly to your inbox Subscribe Thank you for subscribing See our privacy notice Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \n  \n Hundreds of protesters held aloft underwear and chanted \"clothes are not consent\" at a lunchtime rally in the city centre. \n  \n The protest was organised in response to details that emerged of a rape trial in Cork in which a jury was asked to consider the type of underwear a 17 year old defendant was wearing. \n  \n Angry protesters who attended the protest at the Spire on O'Connel Street told Dublin Live they turned up to demand an end to victim blaming and a change the rules on how rape cases are prosecuted. \n  \n Abigal Poynton, 24, travelled from Belturbet in County Cavan to offer her support. \n  \n (Image: Gareth Chaney, Collins) \n  \n She said: \"I left college to come straight to this because as a woman and the mother of a daughter, it's just ridiculous.

Richards/AFP/Getty Images Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images \n  \n Here's a new idea for a Presidential Debate Drinking Game: Every time someone says \"Presidential Debate Drinking Game\" today, take a drink. Just kidding. \n  \n But drinking games have become a familiar part of the American political landscape \u2014 like buttons, bunting and bumper stickers. Where there are political rallies, there are protesting groups. Where there are campaign speeches, there are fact checking teams. And where there are presidential candidates' debates, there are drinking games. \n  \n With the final 2012 presidential tete-a-tete, um, on tap tonight between President Obama and Mitt Romney in Boca Raton, Fla., some Americans are looking forward to the debauchery as well as the debate. \n  \n You know how a debate drinking game works. It is usually played with a group of people who are watching the event. If a candidate utters a predetermined word or phrase, you take a drink \u2014 usually of the alcoholic variety. Some Internet habitu\u00e9s play the game with others online \u2014 putting the mead in social media. \n  \n Games On \n  \n You can find contests tailored to the presidential debates all over the Web. The Cloture Club, a website of Washington goings-on, offers a list of two dozen utterances \u2014 such as \"terrorism\" and \"United Nations\" \u2014 and instructs players to drink each time either candidate speaks the word or phrase tonight. \n  \n NerdWallet, an investment advisory company, breaks down the challenge by candidate. According to the game rules, \"Take a sip when Obama: Mentions the dwindling middle class.\" Or \"When Romney: Interrupts the moderator.\" \n  \n Forward, a Jewish-oriented news site, created a drinking game especially for its readers. Debate watchers are instructed to \"Take a sip if you hear: An anecdote about a Jewish lady in Florida/Ohio/Nevada or some other random swing state,\" among other things. And to \"Pound a shot for: 'Choo-tzpah,' or any other butchered Yiddishism.\" \n  \n \"I suppose if I were in college I, too, might be listening to the diverging opinions on healthcare and homeland security in the same way,\" writes Caren Osten Gerszberg in The Huffington Post. \"In other words: Drink when you hear 'Obamacare'; chug when you hear mention of Al Qaeda; sip continuously if a candidate goes over his allotted response time.\" \n  \n She points to a College Humor drinking game that asks the question: \"As two men face off in a rhetorical battle of epic proportions to determine the future of our great nation, why not booze it up?\" \n  \n Hi, Bob \n  \n Do inventors of drinking games believe that an increase in the intake of alcohol might make some candidates seem more attractive or more coherent? Dan Mueller, creator of Debate Drinking, says, \"Our goal isn't to make the candidates any more interesting to listen to, but rather to encourage people to watch and listen to the debates, and to do so with their friends.\" \n  \n Mueller, a Web designer in Dayton, Ohio, says, \"We try to stay as nonpartisan and inclusive as possible.\" Therefore, Mueller's game avoids the \" 'drink when the other side lies' type of rules,\" he says. \"We know that people have friends and family with differing political views, and we believe that should not get in the way of sharing a beer and hearing both sides of the debates.\" \n  \n Words on Mueller's list include: \"nuclear\" and \"jobs\" for Obama, and \"freedom\" and trade\" for Romney. The official rules also offer this suggestion for tonight's encounter: \"If either candidate greets moderator Bob Schieffer with \"Hi Bob,\" EVERYBODY DRINKS!\" \n  \n A Sad State \n  \n As with everything else in America these days, there is a debate over Debate Drinking Games. \n  \n \"Drinking games generally have the goal of encouraging alcohol consumption to levels of intoxication and, commonly, much higher than the legal limit of intoxication,\" says James Garbutt, a psychiatry professor and director of the Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. \n  \n Whereas a small amount of alcohol might bring on a pleasant feeling, Garbutt explains, too much alcohol can lead to a sad state \"where judgment and social inhibitions can be impaired, which can lead to bad decisions and actions \u2014 think photos and videos that folks wished were never taken, on up to actions leading to legal problems or risk to health.\" \n  \n As alcohol levels rise, Garbutt warns, \"the physical effects increase with impairment in visual acuity, reflexes, motor function and balance \u2014 the reasons why we don't want intoxicated individuals driving. Acute high alcohol levels also increase risk for health consequences such as stomach pain and reflux, vomiting with risk of inhaling vomit and pneumonia, and injuries. \" \n  \n A drinking game, Garbutt adds, \"may be 'fun' in the classic sense of alcohol acting as a social lubricant. But a game that encourages the development of intoxication \u2014 often to well above the legal limit of intoxication \u2014 has few pros. Needless to say, watching a presidential debate while intoxicated is not a good plan for informing oneself about issues that affect our lives.\" \n  \n Ancient Games \n  \n Sarah Lohman, on the other hand, thinks that presidential debate drinking games are harmless. Lohman is the creator of the historic gastronomy website Four Pounds Flour. \"If you're playing a drinking game during the debates, that means you're watching it with friends,\" she says. \"You're paying close attention, and you're probably going to talk about what they said afterwards. To me, there's nothing negative about that.\" \n  \n Drinking games \"are almost as ancient as drinking itself,\" Lohman tells a gathering in Brooklyn recently. (You can listen to Lohman's \"Alcohol and Drinking Games\" podcast here; she begins at the 34:00 mark.) She describes a drinking game played by ancient Greeks that involved flicking wine dregs from one cup into another. She speaks of another centuries-old pastime in China that is an alcohol-laced variation of Rock, Paper, Scissors. And she tells tales of \"toasting games\" that migrated from England to early America. \n  \n By 1830, Lohman says, referring to a chart, the annual per capita consumption of distilled spirits in the United States was five gallons \u2014 for every man, woman and child. Such widespread imbibing led to a strong temperance movement and eventually Prohibition in the 1920s. America probably needed to dry out for a while, she tells the group. \"We were a ... mess.\" \n  \n Nowadays, Lohman says in an interview, \"we drink faaaar less alcohol today than in the 1830s. Currently, we drink a little more than two gallons per capita per year.\" \n  \n But by the looks of all the drinking games, some people drink a little extra \u2014 especially around election time. |||||", "output": "If you're hungover from last night's debate, pop a couple Asprin before reading this story.

Using radiocarbon dating, they have come up with one of the most precise chronologies to date of the events that led to the civilisation's demise. \n  \n The collapse of the Maya civilisation during the classic era, around the 9th century, has been well studied, in part thanks to rich hieroglyphic records. Cities were abandoned and the sophisticated culture fell into oblivion as a result of increased warfare and gradual political decline. \n  \n In contrast, even though there is evidence that another collapse occurred more than six centuries before, very little is known about it. \n  \n The study now published in PNAS looks at how both collapses unfolded, dating precisely the events leading up to it, and showing a parallel between these two moments of Maya history. \n  \n Chronology at Ceibal \n  \n Since 2005, a team of researchers has been running a project known as the Ceibal-Petexbatun Archaeological Project at the ancient Maya site of Ceibal. This site has a long and rich history of occupation spanning nearly 2,000 years, from the so-called \"Preclassic period\" to the \"Classic period\" (from 1000 BC to AD 950). Since their work there began, archaeologists have determined 154 radiocarbon dates from charcoal samples recovered at the site. \n  \n In this research, they used these dates and conducted an in-depth analysis of ceramics discovered at Ceibal to come up with a precise chronology of the site's history. This allowed them to trace the trajectories of the first, Preclassic collapse around AD 150\u2013300 and the second, Classic collapse around AD 800\u2013950. \n  \n In the two cases, they found that similar factors and social contexts could be blamed for causing the demise of the Maya society. The researchers established that violent warfare intensified around 75 BC and AD 735 respectively. Bloody conflicts were then followed by social unrest and the political disintegration of multiple centres across the Maya lowlands, around AD 150 and 810. \n  \n However, the outcomes of the two collapses were different and resulted in very different reorganisations of the political sphere. \n  \n In the wake of the Preclassic collapse, political power was centralised, with the development of dynasties with a divine ruler. On the contrary, following the second collapse in the Classic period, this political system based on divine and authoritarian rulers evolved toward a more decentralised organisation and structure of power, with a stronger reliance on seaborne trade. ||||| Significance Tracing political change through refined chronologies is a critical step for the study of social dynamics. Whereas coarse chronologies can give an impression of gradual change, better temporal control may reveal multiple episodes of rapid disruption comprised in that span. Precise dating through radiocarbon determinations and ceramic studies is particularly important for the study of the Preclassic collapse, which lacks calendrical dates recorded in texts. The high-precision chronology of Ceibal revealed waves of decline over the course of the Preclassic and Classic collapses in a temporal resolution that was not possible before. The emerging understanding of similarities and differences in the two cases of collapse provides an important basis for evaluating the vulnerability and resilience of Maya political systems. \n  \n Abstract The lowland Maya site of Ceibal, Guatemala, had a long history of occupation, spanning from the Middle Preclassic period through the Terminal Classic (1000 BC to AD 950). The Ceibal-Petexbatun Archaeological Project has been conducting archaeological investigations at this site since 2005 and has obtained 154 radiocarbon dates, which represent the largest collection of radiocarbon assays from a single Maya site. The Bayesian analysis of these dates, combined with a detailed study of ceramics, allowed us to develop a high-precision chronology for Ceibal. Through this chronology, we traced the trajectories of the Preclassic collapse around AD 150\u2013300 and the Classic collapse around AD 800\u2013950, revealing similar patterns in the two cases. Social instability started with the intensification of warfare around 75 BC and AD 735, respectively, followed by the fall of multiple centers across the Maya lowlands around AD 150 and 810. The population of Ceibal persisted for some time in both cases, but the center eventually experienced major decline around AD 300 and 900. Despite these similarities in their diachronic trajectories, the outcomes of these collapses were different, with the former associated with the development of dynasties centered on divine rulership and the latter leading to their downfalls. The Ceibal dynasty emerged during the period of low population after the Preclassic collapse, suggesting that this dynasty was placed under the influence from, or by the direct intervention of, an external power. \n  \n The processes of growth and decline of centralized polities represent a critical question in archaeological research. Particularly important moments of political changes in lowland Maya society include the decline of multiple centers at the end of the Preclassic period (around AD 150\u2013300), the emergence of historically documented dynasties at various centers at the end of the Preclassic period and during the Early Classic period (AD 200\u2013600), and the abandonment of many settlements at the end of the Classic period (around AD 800\u2013950). The Classic collapse has long been an important issue in Maya archaeology (1\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u20136). Scholars have presented various theories of its causes, including internal social problems, warfare, environmental degradation, and foreign invasions, although recent debates have focused on the effects of droughts (7\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u201312). Scholars have more recently begun to address the Preclassic collapse, proposing droughts, the filling of lakes with eroded soils, and the intensification of warfare as its potential causes (13\u21d3\u201315). The dynasties of some Classic-period Maya centers appear to have originated in the period slightly before or around the Preclassic collapse, complicating our understanding of social dynamics during this era. The following Early Classic period witnessed the emergence of more dynasties. \n  \n To understand how these episodes of political disintegration and centralization took place, we need to trace their processes through a refined chronology. Coarse chronologies tend to make these processes appear gradual by masking short-term changes. A higher-resolution chronology may reveal a sequence of rapid transformations that are comprised within what appears to be a slow, gradual transition. Such a detailed understanding can provide critical insights into the nature of the social changes. Our intensive archaeological investigations at the center of Ceibal, Guatemala, have produced 154 radiocarbon dates, which represent the largest set of radiocarbon assays ever collected at a Maya site. Combined with a detailed ceramic sequence, this dataset presents an unprecedented opportunity to examine these critical periods of social change in the Maya area. \n  \n Ceibal Ceibal (also spelled Seibal) is the largest site located in the Pasi\u00f3n region of the southwestern Maya lowlands (Fig. 1). The site is known for having one of the earliest ceramic complexes in the Maya lowlands, dating to 1000 BC, and for its late florescence amid the Classic collapse. Ceibal was originally investigated from 1964 through 1968 by the landmark expedition of the Harvard Project (HP) (16\u21d3\u201318). The ceramic chronology established by Sabloff as part of this project provided a solid basis, on which we developed our current study. Located in the Pasi\u00f3n region, Aguateca was studied from 1990 through 2005 by T.I., D.T., and K.A., providing 11 radiocarbon dates. Bachand excavated Punta de Chimino as part of the Aguateca Project and obtained 11 radiocarbon assays (19\u21d3\u201321). We began to work at Ceibal as the Ceibal-Petexbatun Archaeological Project (CPAP) in 2005. Whereas our excavations originally focused on its ceremonial core, Group A, to document early buildings, we expanded our scope to examine a later elite complex, Group D, and the peripheral settlement (Fig. 2). The 154 radiocarbon dates obtained by the CPAP include samples from the ceremonial cores and the outlying residential zone, as well as 9 assays from the minor center of Caobal excavated by Munson (22\u21d3\u21d3\u201325). Fig. 1. Map of the Maya lowlands with a close-up of the Pasi\u00f3n region. Fig. 2. Map of Ceibal with a close-up of Group A. At Maya sites with long occupation, such as Ceibal, old deposits were often reused for fills of later constructions, and thus many layers commonly contained old pieces of charcoal. To reduce problems of stratigraphic mixing, we collected carbon samples mainly from primary contexts, such as on-floor burned layers, burials, caches, and shallow middens. When such contexts were not available, we also took samples from construction fills but focused mainly on those containing materials moved from short-period deposits, such as transferred middens and dumps. \n  \n Analysis We developed Bayesian models of our radiocarbon dates by combining information on stratigraphic sequences and ceramic phases. For the Classic period, we also incorporated calendrical dates. In the analysis of the radiocarbon dates, identifying stratigraphically mixed carbon samples and old wood was a critical step (26, 27). The Oxcal program version 4.2 facilitated this process through the statistical identification of outliers and visual representations of probability distributions (28\u21d3\u201330). The resulting refined calibrated dates helped us improve our ceramic chronology (Figs. 3 and 4, Figs. S1\u2013S3, SI Text, Tables S1 and S2, and Datasets S1 and S2). Our ceramic analysis showed that the original chronology developed by Sabloff was sound and solid. With detailed stratigraphic information from CPAP excavations and radiocarbon dates, we subdivided Sabloff\u2019s phases into shorter facets and established two new phases: Xate for the Terminal Preclassic (75 BC to AD 175) and Samat for the Postclassic (AD 1000\u20131200). The study of the Classic collapse through radiocarbon dating was challenging because calibrated radiocarbon dates from AD 700\u2013950 typically had wide ranges of uncertainty resulting from a flat section and large bends in the calibration curve for this time period. In examining this problematic period, we relied primarily on textual information from inscriptions to identify precise timings of political changes (31, 32). We have reported the results of our chronological study for the Middle Preclassic period (1000\u2013350 BC) in previous publications (23, 24). This article primarily addresses the Late and Terminal Preclassic (350 BC to AD 175) and Classic (AD 175\u2013950) periods. Fig. 3. Results of Bayesian analysis showing the probability distributions of phase boundaries. Fig. 4. Chronological chart showing the ceramic phases of Ceibal and other Maya sites. To examine social trajectories, scholars have commonly estimated population levels with data obtained through survey, surface collection, and test excavations (33). Settlement investigations by Tourtellot during the HP provided important data in this regard (34). Nonetheless, surface collection and small test excavations typically produce a limited quantity of artifacts per tested site and may lack strict control of stratigraphy and contexts. The resulting chronological information tends to be coarse. Our study emphasized deep stratigraphic excavations, in which most lots (units of contextual control) were assigned to specific facets of our high-resolution chronology. The frequencies of lots and ceramics dating to specific temporal spans should approximate the intensity of construction and economic activity during those periods. To examine diachronic trends, we calculated values adjusted for the different lengths of periods, which we called time-weighed lot indices (TWLIs) and time-weighed ceramic indices (TWCIs) (Fig. 5 and SI Text). We should note potential biases in these data. For example, the large values for the Real and Escoba phases resulted partly from our excavation strategies emphasizing early constructions in Group A. Likewise, the TWLIs for the Bayal phase were somewhat inflated because we often subdivided a final occupation layer into more than one lot. Thus, TWLIs and TWCIs do not translate directly into regional population levels, but they reflect general diachronic trends and help us identify moments of marked increase and decline in construction and economic activity. Combined with Tourtellot\u2019s data on regional demographic estimates, our study traced social changes at a temporal resolution that was not possible before. Fig. 5. TWLIs and TWCIs, approximating the intensities of construction and economic activity through time (SI Text and Tables S3\u2013S4). \n  \n Results The first signs of social problems leading to the Preclassic collapse at Ceibal emerged at the beginning of the Xate phase, around 75 BC. Our study confirmed the observation by the HP researchers that the population of Ceibal declined significantly from the Cantutse phase to the Xate phase (Sabloff originally called them the Early and Late Cantutse phases, respectively) (18, 34). Xate ceramics at Ceibal corresponded to what Brady et al. defined as Protoclassic 1 ceramics for the Maya lowlands in general, which were characterized by pseudo-Usulutan decorations with parallel wavy lines and nubbin, conical, or hemispherical tetrapods (35). Besides these diagnostic traits, many Cantutse ceramic types continued into the following period, making the identification of Xate occupation challenging. Tourtellot\u2019s calculation of a 74% population drop may have underestimated Xate occupation, but TWLIs and TWCIs also decreased drastically during the Xate 1 facet, suggesting that the decline in activity was real. An important change during this period was the establishment of Group D on a defensible hill surrounded by steep gullies and an escarpment. Although some residential groups in the periphery of Group D may have started during the Cantutse phase, as indicated by the HP archaeologists, our excavations demonstrated that the initial constructions of the ceremonial core of Group D dated to the Xate 1 facet. It is likely that the decline of Ceibal around 75 BC was related to the intensification of warfare in the region. Activity levels in Group D and the outlying residential zone remained fairly constant from the Xate 1 to Xate 2 facet. The higher TWLI and TWCI of the Xate 2 facet in Group A resulted mostly from a large number of ritual caches deposited there. The TWLI and TWCI declined significantly during the Xate 3 facet (AD 125\u2013175), particularly in Group D and the residential zone. The values of this period for Group A are again inflated by numerous ritual deposits, although a similar decline in construction likely occurred in Group A as well. Group D and the residential zone regained some vigor during the Junco 1 facet (AD 175\u2013300), which corresponded to Brady et al.\u2019s Protoclassic 2 phase (35), characterized by Ixcanrio Polychrome and bulbous mammiform tetrapods. Tourtellot recorded a considerable number of Junco loci and suggested the continuity of Junco occupation from the Preclassic period. We suspect that a substantial portion of the Junco occupation identified by the HP researchers dated more specifically to the Junco 1 facet. All of the studied areas, however, experienced a drastic decline at the end of this period, around AD 300. Some scholars have suggested that the ceramic types of the Preclassic period continued to be produced during the Early Classic period in the southwestern lowlands and that the assignments of these ceramics to the Preclassic resulted in significant underrepresentations of Early Classic populations (36, 37). Our ceramic study, however, showed that these ceramics could be confidently separated, and the Early Classic population decline was real. Many parts of Group D and the residential zone were deserted, and some minor temples in outlying areas were intentionally buried with black soils (34). Only a small population remained at Ceibal during the Junco 2 facet (AD 300\u2013400). The population level of Ceibal remained low throughout the Junco 2, 3, and 4 facets (AD 300\u2013600). Remarkably, the Ceibal dynasty appears to have been established during this dark age of the center. The Ceibal Hieroglyphic Stairway, dedicated in AD 751, retrospectively mentions an early ruler possessing the Ceibal emblem glyph (dynastic title), who was active in AD 415 (38, 39). The reign of this individual at the beginning of the Junco 3 facet may have represented the origins of the Ceibal dynasty, although the inscription does not specify him as the dynastic founder. Excavations in Platform A-2 and the East Court of Group A, as well as the Karinel Group located near Group A, uncovered Junco 3 ceramics, which closely resemble those from central Pet\u00e9n, including Dos Arroyos Polychrome and Balanza Black vessels with basal flanges, as well as a small number of Teotihuacan-inspired tripod vases. It is probable that the Ceibal dynasty was established under influence from, or through the direct intervention of, central Pet\u00e9n groups, possibly the growing center of Tikal. Notably, the largest concentration of Junco 3 ceramics was found in Platform A-2 located on the southern side of the South Plaza, which was likely a focus of elite activity during this period. This location may have mimicked the position of the Tikal royal place, the South Acropolis. The HP researchers suggested that Ceibal was virtually abandoned during the sixth century, which made scholars wonder how the line of this early ruler connected to the Late Classic dynasty of Ceibal (40). Our research identified Junco 4 occupation dating to this assumed period of abandonment, which indicates that there was some continuity in the population of Ceibal, albeit diminished, from the Junco phase to the Late Classic Tepejilote phase. Tikal\u2019s influence over the Pasi\u00f3n region appears to have ceased after its defeat in AD 562 (41), but the Ceibal dynasty may have persisted. After rapid population growth during the Tepejilote 1 facet (AD 600\u2013700), the Classic-period decline of Ceibal started with its defeat by the Dos Pilas-Aguateca dynasty in AD 735, during the Tepejilote 2 facet (AD 700\u2013750). Construction and economic activity dropped significantly during the following Tepejilote 3 facet (AD 750\u2013810). An illegitimate ruler named Ajaw Bot, who did not use the Ceibal emblem glyph, appears to have placed his palace in the defensible location of Group D, probably as a response to the intensification of warfare during this period (42). The number of bifacial points, possibly used as weapons, also increased significantly (43). The reign of Ajaw Bot ended shortly after the dedication of his last monuments in AD 800, and Ceibal underwent a hiatus in monument erection until AD 849. Excavations at Group D by Bazy demonstrated that many buildings were ritually destroyed, most likely at the end of Ajaw Bot\u2019s rule (44). The relatively high TWLI and TWCI of Group D for the Tepejilote 3 facet resulted from Bazy\u2019s excavation strategy targeting these termination deposits. We were not able to subdivide the Bayal phase (AD 810\u2013950), and thus the TWLI and TWCI for this period were not refined enough to trace the social trend associated with this political disruption. Nonetheless, investigations by the HP and CPAP indicate that a considerable number of peripheral groups were abandoned or exhibited little activity during the Bayal phase, which possibly reflects the social effects of Ajaw Bot\u2019s fall. The arrival of a new ruler holding the Ceibal emblem glyph in AD 829, whose name may be read as Wat\u2019ul K\u2019atel, heralded a revival of Ceibal during the Bayal phase (45). This political regime, however, collapsed soon after AD 889, the last date recorded on monuments. The royal palace located in the East Court and some temples in Group A were destroyed, and Ceibal was completely abandoned (46). \n  \n Discussion Whereas the Classic collapse has a long history of study, aided by rich hieroglyphic records, the understanding of the Preclassic collapse is more limited. In this regard, our high-resolution chronology provides particularly important information on the latter. The trajectory of the Preclassic collapse at Ceibal exhibits a notable resemblance with that of the Classic collapse, with multiple waves of decline followed by short episodes of limited recovery. In both cases, the first signs of social problems appear to have been related to the intensification of warfare. Probable fortifications dating to the Late or Terminal Preclassic period are found at other Maya sites, including El Mirador, Becan, Edzna, Cerros, Murralla de Le\u00f3n, Cival, Chaak Ak\u2019al, and multiple hilltop sites along the Upper Usumacinta River (47\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u201355). Although it is not clear whether other Maya communities experienced decline during their Xate 1-corresponding periods, the construction of Group D in a defensible location at Ceibal was probably part of the growing social instability throughout the Maya lowlands around this time. The process of the Classic collapse in the Pasi\u00f3n region also began with the escalation of violent conflicts. Following the defeat of Ceibal in AD 735, Dos Pilas was also vanquished in AD 761 (56, 57). Then, a series of defensive walls were constructed at Dos Pilas and Aguateca, and Group D again became the center of elite occupation (58, 59). Violent encounters appear to have increased in other parts of the Maya lowlands as well (10). In both the Preclassic and Classic collapses, early signs of decline were followed by a wave of drastic political disintegration throughout the Maya lowlands. In the former period, the major center of El Mirador and other Maya communities declined around AD 150\u2013175. The fall of El Mirador appears to have occurred during, or at the end of, the Xate 3-corresponding period, that is, the Protoclassic 1 phase, because of the presence of ceramics with pseudo-Usulutan decorations and tetrapods and the absence of Ixcanrio Polychrome and bulbous mammiform supports in abandonment layers at El Mirador (60). Similarly, during the Classic collapse a major wave of political disintegration occurred around AD 810, which affected many centers over a wide area. Social impacts were particularly profound in the southwestern lowlands, where Aguateca, Cancuen, Yaxchilan, Piedras Negras, and Palenque declined or were abandoned in a short period (61, 62). The fall of Ajaw Bot at Ceibal was most likely tied to this regional process. Centers in other parts of the southern lowlands, such as Tikal, Calakmul, Tonina, and Copan, experienced somewhat more gradual decline or a hiatus in monument erection, although signs of political problems were not so clear in the northern lowlands (63). These major waves of political disintegration in both the Preclassic and Classic collapses may have corresponded with prolonged droughts, which may have exacerbated deteriorating social conditions (6, 12, 14, 15). Processes following the wave of major collapse during the Preclassic and Classic periods appear to have varied in different regions. At Ceibal, the decline around AD 300 was the most profound in the course of the Preclassic collapse. The Belizean site of Cerros may also have been abandoned around AD 300, following a major decline in population and construction around AD 150\u2013175 (64, 65). It is not clear how widespread the wave of collapse around AD 300 was in other areas. In the central lowlands, dynastic rule solidified during this period. In the case of the Classic collapse, the ninth century witnessed political recovery at a limited number of southern lowland centers, including Ceibal, Tonina, Tikal, and Calakmul, and the prosperity of northern communities, including Uxmal, other Puuc centers, Chichen Itza, and Ek Balam. Many of these centers declined around AD 900\u2013950, and only Chichen Itza continued as a powerful center for another century or so (66). An intriguing question is the relation between the Preclassic collapse and the origins of Maya dynasties. Although the initial development of rulership can be traced back at least to the Late Preclassic period, as suggested by the San Bartolo murals, it was around the first century AD that historically recorded dynasties and royal tombs emerged at Tikal and possibly at other centers in the central lowlands (63, 67). These early dynasties probably predated and survived the major wave of collapse around AD 150\u2013175. Centers in the peripheral zones of the Maya lowlands likely had some forms of political centralization during the Preclassic period, but the historically known dynasties of these regions, such as Ceibal, Yaxchilan, Piedras Negras, Palenque, and Copan, appear to have originated during the fourth and fifth centuries, in some cases through connections with the developed dynasties of the central lowlands. Tikal, in particular, appears to have spread its political influence to Ceibal and other parts of the Pasi\u00f3n region, whose population levels continued to be low in the wake of the Preclassic collapse (41). The Preclassic and Classic collapse exhibited tantalizing similarities in their diachronic patterns with multiple waves of political disruption, but they differed significantly in terms of the resulting forms of political organization. Whereas the former was tied to the development of dynasties with divine rulership, the latter led to the decline of this political system toward more decentralized organization and a stronger reliance on seaborne trade (5). Further analysis of these processes based on high-resolution chronologies should provide important insights into the vulnerability and resilience of these political systems. \n  \n Acknowledgments We thank two anonymous reviewers for their comments.

More recent investigations have revealed that the Maya also experienced an earlier collapse in the second century A.D. \u2014 now called the Preclassic collapse \u2014 that is even more poorly understood. \n  \n University of Arizona archaeologist Takeshi Inomata and his colleagues suggest in a new paper, to be published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, that both collapses followed similar trajectories, with multiple waves of social instability, warfare and political crises leading to the rapid fall of many city centers. \n  \n The findings are based on a highly refined chronology developed by Inomata and his colleagues using an unprecedented 154 radiocarbon dates from the archaeological site of Ceibal in Guatemala, where the team has worked for over a decade. \n  \n While more general chronologies might suggest that the Maya collapses occurred gradually, this new, more precise chronology indicates more complex patterns of political crises and recoveries leading up to each collapse. \n  \n \"What we found out is that those two cases of collapse (Classic and Preclassic) follow similar patterns,\" said Inomata, the paper's lead author and a professor in the School of Anthropology in the UA College of Social and Behavioral Sciences. \"It's not just a simple collapse, but there are waves of collapse. First, there are smaller waves, tied to warfare and some political instability, then comes the major collapse, in which many centers got abandoned. Then there was some recovery in some places, then another collapse.\" \n  \n Using radiocarbon dating and data from ceramics and highly controlled archaeological excavations, the researchers were able to establish the refined chronology of when population sizes and building construction increased and decreased at Ceibal. \n  \n While the findings may not solve the mystery of why exactly the Maya collapses occurred, they are an important step toward better understanding how they unfolded. \n  \n \"It's really, really interesting that these collapses both look very similar, at very different time periods,\" said Melissa Burham, one of three UA anthropology graduate students who co-authored the paper. \"We now have a good understanding of what the process looked like, that potentially can serve as a template for other people to try to see if they have a similar pattern at their (archaeological) sites in the same area.\" \n  \n Inomata and his UA colleagues \u2014 anthropology professor Daniela Triadan and students Burham, Jessica MacLellan and Juan Manuel Palomo \u2014 worked with collaborators at Ibaraki University, Naruto University of Education and the Graduate University for Advanced Studies in Japan, and with Guatemalan archaeologists and students. \n  \n Radiocarbon dating was done at Paleo Laboratory Company in Japan and at the Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Laboratory in the UA Department of Physics. \n  \n \"Radiocarbon dating has been used for a long time, but now we're getting to an interesting period because it's getting more and more precise,\" said Inomata, who also is an Agnese Nelms Haury Chair in Environment and Social Justice at the UA. \"We're getting to the point where we can get to the interesting social patterns because the chronology is refined enough, and the dating is precise enough.\" \n  \n Inomata's research was funded in part by the National Science Foundation, National Endowment for the Humanities, National Geographic Foundation, the Alphawood Foundation and the UA's Agnes Nelms Haury Program in Environment and Social Justice. |||||", "output": "The Maya civilization suffered \"waves\" of war and political instability before its collapse in the 2nd century. The civilization later recovered, but history would repeat itself just a few hundred years later, delivering a final blow, researchers explain in a PNAS study offering a clear chronology of the civilization's demise. It's based on 154 radiocarbon dates from charcoal samples along with data from ceramics at the site of Ceibal in Guatemala which show \"similar patterns\" of warfare around 75 BC and AD 735, reports the International Business Times. Each was followed by a period of political upheaval, the first of which led into the Preclassic collapse of AD 150-300. Ceibal then saw a population decline and many other Maya cities were abandoned. But with \"the development of dynasties centered on divine rulership,\" the civilization soon after rallied as power centralized, say researchers at the University of Arizona. However, warfare returned a few centuries later, resulting in a new period of political instability. This one led into the Classic collapse circa AD 800-950, when Ceibal again experienced a population decline, according to a release. But this time, power splintered and the Maya were unable to recover. Archaeologists now hope to survey other Maya sites for similar patterns of decline that may show why the Classic collapse proved fatal.

They treated her like a criminal, they didn't even let her get her things out of her classroom,\" says one, noting Morffi \"by far was one of the best teachers out there.\" Morffi had worked at the school for almost seven years, coached basketball, and took students to deliver meals to the homeless on weekends, a friend says. She's \"made such a contribution to the school. She never imposes her personal beliefs on others. She just does everything in love,\" says an \"outraged\" parent. Nonetheless, a spokesperson for the Archdiocese of Miami says Morffi violated her contract, which notes teachers may be fired for conduct \"inconsistent\" with Catholic teachings. Other teachers received verbal warnings simply for attending the wedding, reports ABC News. A mother tells the Herald she's withdrawing her child from the school as a result.

For example, member nations have agreed to inspect all planes and ships carrying North Korean imports and exports and to stop selling aviation fuel to North Korea. \n  \n U.S. President Barack Obama immediately praised the action, saying, \"Today, the international community, speaking with one voice, has sent Pyongyang a simple message: North Korea must abandon these dangerous programs and choose a better path for its people.\" \n  \n Samantha Power, U.S. ambassador to the U.N., told the Security Council that North Korea not only treated its population with cruelty, it was the only nation to conduct a nuclear test in the 21st century. \n  \n \"With each nuclear test and launch using ballistic missile technology, the DPRK improves its capability to carry out a ballistic missile attack not only in the region but a continent away,\" she said. \"That means having the ability to strike most of the countries sitting on this council. Think about that.\" \n  \n Power said the sanctions will: \n  \n -- Require all North Korean planes and ships carrying cargo to be inspected. Previously, nations only inspected planes and ships when they had \"reasonable grounds,\" which enabled North Korea to hide tools and parts for missiles and the nuclear program in inconspicuous packages, Power said. \"This is hugely significant,\" she said. \n  \n -- Ban Pyongyang from exporting most of the country's natural resources. Coal alone accounted for about $1 billion in annual income, she said. \n  \n -- Ask U.N. member states to ban North Korea from opening banks, and to close any banks believed to be associated with North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. \n  \n -- Direct member states to expel North Korean diplomats and foreign nationals engaged in illicit activities. \n  \n -- Prohibit nations from providing training to North Korean nationals in fields that could advance the nation's missile and nuclear programs, such as aerospace engineering and advanced computer simulation. \n  \n -- Ban member states from allowing North Korea to charter foreign vessels or aircraft, and ban all nations from operating any vessels that use North Korean flags. \n  \n -- Prohibit the supply of aviation fuel -- including rocket fuel -- and the sale of small arms to North Korea. \n  \n Defiant bomb test spurred discussions \n  \n The United States says these are the toughest sanctions ever imposed by the Security Council -- much tougher than those under which North Korea already lives. \n  \n Discussions about new sanctions started after North Korea claimed to have successfully tested a hydrogen bomb in January -- its fourth nuclear test. \n  \n In a signed letter broadcast on state-run media, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un wrote that he wanted to ring in the new year with, quite literally, a bang. \n  \n \"For the victorious and glorious year of 2016 when the 7th convention of the Workers' Party will be held, make the world look up to our strong nuclear country and labor party by opening the year with exciting noise of the first hydrogen bomb!\" the letter read. \n  \n In February, Pyongyang said it had successfully launched an Earth satellite into orbit via the long-range Kwangmyongsong carrier rocket. \n  \n South Korea thanks U.S., China \n  \n The nuclear test and missile launch outraged the Security Council and worried neighboring nations. \n  \n A spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said following the vote: \"This firm response by the Security Council should put an end to the cycle of provocation and lead to the resumption of dialogue in accordance with the unified view of the international community.\" \n  \n After the vote, the South Korean government issued a statement thanking the United States for initiating the sanctions. Seoul also gave thanks to China \"for having engaged in lengthy consultations.\" \n  \n \"A nuclear-armed North Korea will seriously impair the [South Korean] regime, and could induce an arms race in the region, undermining peace and security of the world as a whole,\" the said. \n  \n Japan's permanent representative to the U.N., Motohide Yoshikawa, also thanked the United States for taking the lead. \n  \n \"The DPRK must realize that this message is not only coming from the members of the Security Council but from the international community as a whole,\" he said. \"Let us be clear. No single country in the world supports the nuclear test nor ballistic missile launch by the DPRK.\" \n  \n Resolution singles out North Korean individuals, entities \n  \n Speaking before the vote, Power stressed that the resolution is not meant to punish the people of North Korea. \n  \n JUST WATCHED Should North Korea's new military chief watch his back?

Rather, this resolution focuses on a ruling elite that have inflicted so much of that suffering,\" she said. \n  \n A U.S. official familiar with the text said the 22-page resolution lists 17 North Korean individuals and 12 North Korean entities that would be subject to sanctions. The people and companies are believed to be facilitators for North Korea's weapons programs. Some operate overseas. \n  \n The company list includes the aerospace equivalent of NASA in Pyongyang. A major bank in North Korea suspected of conducting many financial transactions for the nation's military nuclear and missile tests is on the list, too, the official said. The sanctions would reportedly ban more luxury goods going into North Korea. \n  \n When asked whether the resolution would make a difference in North Korea's behavior, the official expressed confidence. \n  \n \"It will have an impact,\" said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ||||| FILE - In this July 28, 2015 file photo, under the portraits of the late North Korean leaders, Kim Il Sung, left, and Kim Jong Il, ambassador of the Permanent Mission of the Democratic People's Republic...

They were on spring break, and wanted to get some pizza for lunch and see the Easter decorations.

They described him at a press conference as a former drifter who worked in carnivals and landscaping in about a dozen states from the 1970s through the 1990s. \n  \n Montgomery County Police Chief Tom Manger said the department believes Welch was at the Wheaton Plaza mall, about 5 miles northeast of Bethesda, on March 25, 1975, the day that sisters Katherine and Sheila Lyon, aged 10 and 12, disappeared. \n  \n \"Based on his criminal past, his convictions, we believe that there may be other cases in these other states, other locations where he was during that time that we may be able to connect him to,\" Manger told reporters. \n  \n Welch has been imprisoned in Delaware since 1997. Manger said that police had recently become interested in his possible involvement in the case, but declined to discuss specifics of what prompted their interest. \n  \n Police would not say if they have interviewed Welch. \n  \n The disappearance of the two girls, daughters of a local radio personality, set off extensive searches by police and the National Guard. The sisters were last seen by a witness talking to a man at the mall who had a tape recorder inside a briefcase. \n  \n \"This case shocked our community in 1975 and has never been forgotten by the police department or anyone who followed the case 39 years ago,\" Manger said. \n  \n Police said Welch, who is originally from the Washington, D.C., area and used the aliases \"Michael\" and \"Mike,\" was \"observed paying attention\" to the sisters at the mall on the day they disappeared. It is unclear whether Welch's carnival company, which often traveled to malls, had set up at Wheaton Plaza on this day, police said in a statement. \n  \n They said Welch had been convicted of raping young girls in Virginia, Delaware and South Carolina. \n  \n Investigators are seeking information from anyone who may have had contact with Welch during his travels through states including Maryland, Florida, California, South Carolina, Virginia and Iowa. They are also looking for information about his girlfriend, Helen Craver, an employee of the same carnival company who has since died, and security guards working on the day the girls disappeared. \n  \n Police released a composite sketch from March 1975, which shows a man with a mustache and long hair, described as being in his late teens or early 20's. It was drawn from a witness's description of \"a man that was following and may have had contact with the Lyon sisters,\" Manger said. \n  \n In a statement released by police, the Lyon family asked for privacy. \n  \n \"The fact that so many people still care about this case means a great deal to us,\" the statement read. \"We are grateful for any information the public can provide to help bring this story to its conclusion.\" \n  \n (Editing by Scott Malone and Leslie Adler) ||||| Undated photos of Sheila and Katherine Lyon released by the FBI.

Thomas Manger stressed that detectives don\u2019t have evidence to file charges against Welch but are continuing to try to learn as much about him as they can. \n  \n \u201cThis case shocked our community in 1975 and has never been forgotten,\u201d Manger said. \n  \n Longtime residents certainly feel that way. To them, the Lyon sisters are part of Montgomery\u2019s history, their disappearance a seminal event that signaled that it was no longer safe for girls to walk alone \u2014 or that it never really had been. \u201cIt kind of traumatized the area,\u201d said Steve Murray, who has a Facebook page named \u201cWheaton Plaza,\u201d on which people post memories of the now renovated and renamed mall, sometimes still mourning the loss of the girls. \u201cThis was such a sad time and it changed the way a lot of us lived,\u201d Sharon McDaniel, who lived in Kensington, wrote there Tuesday. \n  \n In a statement provided by police, the Lyon family asked for privacy and said they would be \u201cgrateful for any information the public can provide to help bring this story to its conclusion.\u201d \n  \n \u201cMarch 25th will mark 39 years since Kate and Sheila were taken from our family,\u201d they said. \u201cThroughout these years our hopes for a resolution of this mystery have been sustained by the support and efforts of countless members of law enforcement, the news media, and the community. The fact that so many people still care about this case means a great deal to us.\u201d \n  \n Police knew about Welch early in the investigation, authorities said, but it\u2019s not clear whether they ever suspected that he could be involved. Back then, he was 18 years old and was known to stay in homeless shelters and hotels. He had a serious girlfriend, police said, who also worked with the carnival. It would be decades before his convictions for sex crimes in other states. \n  \n Late last year, Montgomery detectives looking through the case files began to take a new look at Welch. \u201cHe jumped out at us in the past couple of months,\u201d said Assistant Montgomery Police Chief Russ Hamill. \n  \n Old case file documents show that a young girl who was with the Lyon sisters that afternoon had described a man who followed the three of them that day. Police developed a sketch partly based on that description, they said. It resembles a mug shot taken of Welch a few years later \u2014 in 1977 \u2014 when he was arrested in a burglary case in Montgomery. \n  \n Welch went on to assault girls in South Carolina and Delaware, where he is in prison, police said. The details of the Delaware case are not clear, but court papers show that he pleaded guilty in 1998 to several sex offenses. Officials said he is due to be set free in 2027 but has asked for early release. The Board of Pardons has scheduled a hearing for July. \n  \n Welch\u2019s niece, Debbie Roe, 38, of Dover, Del., said she is the only member of the family who is in regular contact with him. She said she has written letters on and off to him for the past 13 years during his incarceration. She described him as \u201csweet\u201d and said he is excited when she visits him in prison. \n  \n She said that Welch has denied involvement in the disappearance of the Lyon girls but told her that he was at Wheaton Plaza that day. \n  \n \u201cThe only thing he said he did was walk around the mall,\u201d Roe said. \u201cI think they need to look elsewhere. He doesn\u2019t know where the girls are.\u201d \n  \n Darlene Hawn, 57, Welch\u2019s half sister, said news of his possible involvement was a surprise. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d said Hawn, also of Dover. \u201cIt\u2019s just a shock.\u201d \n  \n Family members said that Welch had a difficult childhood. They said his father was driving drunk one night and crashed a car, killing his wife. Welch was a passenger in the vehicle, relatives said. After that, Welch was put in foster care, but they added that he briefly returned to live with his father and stepmother at their home in Hyattsville when he was 11 or 12. They also said he had brushes with the law. \u201cHe never stayed home,\u201d Hawn said. \u201cHe was always going places and getting into trouble.\u201d \n  \n Dolores Askins of Silver Spring said her sister, Helen Craver, dated Welch for about 10 years starting in the 1970s. During that time, Askins said, the couple worked for a variety of carnivals, setting up rides and tending the grounds. They lived on the road and had no permanent home. Askins said that they had four children together but that authorities eventually removed them because the couple were unable to provide for them. \n  \n \u201cNobody was happy that she took up with Lloyd,\u201d Askins said. \u201cEverybody was happy when she left him simply because of what she had been through.\u201d \n  \n Askins said that Craver eventually remarried but never got her children back. She said that Craver died several years ago. \n  \n Police said that Welch \u2014 who also went by the name Michael Lee Welch \u2014 has traveled from state to state, and they released a timeline of places he has lived in or visited. During a 20-year stretch, he has been in at least six states \u2014 from Sioux City, Iowa, to Los Angeles to Union County, S.C. He also has worked as a landscaper. \n  \n Police said detectives are trying to find security guards who worked at Wheaton Plaza in 1975 and might have had some contact with Welch, particularly one who held the rank of captain. They want to hear from anyone who knows him or knew his girlfriend. \n  \n Police said they still don\u2019t know what happened to the Lyon sisters but will keep looking for answers. \n  \n \u201cThe family deserves justice,\u201d Manger said. \n  \n Lynh Bui, Jennifer Jenkins, John Kelly, Patrick Svitek and Matt Zapotosky contributed to this report. \n  \n FBI timeline of Welch\u2019s travels \n  \n How contact law enforcement about the case: Call 1-800-CALL-FBI or visit tips.fbi.gov \n  \n Get updates on your area delivered via e-mail |||||", "output": "Sheila Lyon, 12, and her sister Katherine, 10, went to see an Easter exhibit at a Maryland shopping mall on March 25, 1975, and were never seen again.

On Friday, the New Zealand authorities were first alerted by the government of Kiribati \u2014 which is about halfway between Hawaii and Australia \u2014 that the vessel had vanished after leaving for what was supposed to be a two-day, 150-mile voyage. \n  \n New Zealand\u2019s military joined the search the next day, and rescued seven people, including a 14-year-old girl, on the small dinghy.

The ruling is one of few regarding the marriage of a half-uncle or half-aunt to a half-niece or half-nephew in the state since such marriages were made illegal more than 100 years ago. \n  \n Huyen Nguyen, then 19, married her 24-year-old half-uncle, Vu Truong, in 2000.

The 2nd Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals then asked the state's highest court for its opinion on the marriage's legality. \n  \n The court in a 6-0 decision declared the marriage \"not void as incestuous.\" \n  \n Judge Robert Smith wrote that while state law prohibits primarily parent-child and brother-sister marriages \u2014 \"grounded in the almost universal horror with which such marriages are viewed\" \u2014 there is no comparably strong objection to uncle-niece marriages. Smith wrote that the domestic relations law prohibiting some whole- and half-blood marriages \"has not been viewed as expressing strong condemnation of uncle-niece and aunt-nephew relationships.\" \n  \n He also wrote that both parties agreed that genetic risks of half-blood uncle-niece marriages are the same as that of first cousins, relations who can legally marry in New York. \n  \n \"I conclude that it was not the Legislature's purpose to avert the similar, relatively small, genetic risk inherent in relationship like this one,\" Smith wrote. \n  \n Judge Victoria Graffeo wrote in her concurring opinion that the court didn't receive any scientific evidence that would allow it to draw a conclusion about the genetic ramifications of such half-blood marriages. \n  \n Michael Marszalkowski, a Buffalo lawyer who represented Nguyen, said the couple's first reaction to the high court's decision was one of relief and joy. \n  \n \"It's an incredible weight lifted off their shoulders,\" Marszalkowski said, later adding that the next step is to seek a green card from immigration authorities. \"The husband was so happy.\" \n  \n Very few cases of this type of half-blood marriage have been brought before New York courts since 1893, when whole- and half-blood uncle-niece and aunt-nephew marriages were prohibited. \n  \n Marszalkowski called this case client-specific, and said his research suggested \"less than a handful\" of similar cases. \n  \n In the three instances when the matter came before state courts previously, \"every one of those was a fight over money, so it was a question of someone trying to exclude someone else in using the relationship as a way to get an advantage,\" he said. \n  \n Albany Law professor Vincent Bonventre, one of the state's top court-watchers, said the decision would set precedent. \"The court made it clear that its construction of the statute applies to criminal cases or civil cases: It's universally applicable,\" Bonventre said. \"From now on, unless the Legislature changes the rule, a half-uncle is permitted to marry a half-niece.\" \n  \n mhamilton@timesunion.com \u2022 518-454-5449 ||||| The case, Huyen Nguyen v.

A federal appeals court asked the New York Court of Appeals to decide whether such marriages were lawful. \n  \n Nguyen was aged 19 and Truong was 24 when they got married. \n  \n The U.S. Justice Department claimed an 1893 state law that bars marriages between \"a brother and sister of either the whole or the half blood,\" as well as \"uncles and nieces or aunts and nephews,\" applied to Nguyen and Truong. \n  \n Nguyen's attorneys countered that the law was designed to ensure stability within families and stave off the risks associated with close relatives having children. Neither of those concerns applied in Nguyen's case, they said. \n  \n In a 6-0 decision siding with Nguyen, Judge Robert Smith wrote, \"First cousins are allowed to marry in New York, and I conclude that it was not the Legislature's purpose to avert the similar, relatively small, genetic risk inherent in relationships like this one.\" \n  \n The decision by the court in Albany, which allows Nguyen to remain in the United States, went against a 1921 ruling in which the court said a man's marriage to his half-brother's daughter was void. \n  \n Kathryn Audley had sought a divorce from her father's half-brother, whom she accused of adultery, but the court said it was unnecessary because the marriage was unlawful. \n  \n Nguyen's lawyer, Michael Marszalkowski, said he was pleased with Tuesday's ruling. \n  \n \"This couple every day has worried about whether they have a future together,\" he said. \n  \n The U.S. Justice Department declined to comment. \n  \n According to court documents, Maine is the only state that expressly allows marriages between uncles and nieces or aunts and nephews.

We'll see how it goes,\" Patriots coach Bill Belichick said Tuesday. \n  \n Tebow is wearing Jersey No. 5 at the team's mandatory minicamp, according to the roster distributed to the media by the Patriots. He has worn No. 15 in his first three NFL seasons but that number belongs to backup quarterback Ryan Mallett. \n  \n Tebow was signed to be a quarterback on the Patriots' roster, sources told ESPN NFL Insider Ed Werder. \n  \n When asked what position Tebow will play, Belichick said, \"we will see.\" \n  \n Apparently tired of the Tebow questions, the coach tried to change the subject after several minutes. \n  \n \"We've already talked enough about him. We'll see how it goes, take it from there,\" he said. \n  \n Former NFL quarterback Chris Weinke, who has been working with Tebow over the past month to tweak his throwing mechanics, told USA Today Sports that he believes Tebow can play quarterback in the NFL. \n  \n \"Like I told Tim when I found out [Monday] that he signed, 'You're locked and loaded, ready to go,' \" he told the newspaper. \n  \n The move reunites Tebow with Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, who was the Broncos' head coach when Denver traded into the first round to draft the Heisman Trophy winner in 2010. \n  \n Belichick often has spoken with admiration of Tebow's versatility, intelligence and character. Belichick covets what he has described as tough, smart, versatile football players. \n  \n Last month, Yahoo! Sports cited an \"organizational source\" as saying Belichick disliked Tebow as a player and there was \"no chance\" of him landing in New England. Belichick dismissed that notion last week, telling ESPNBoston.com that the report was completely untrue. \n  \n Ironically, Tebow's last NFL start came in Denver's blowout playoff loss in Foxborough to Tom Brady and the Patriots following the 2011 season. \n  \n Tebow, 25, figures to compete with Mallett for a backup job behind Brady. The Patriots also released reserve quarterback Mike Kafka on Monday. \n  \n One of the NFL's most polarizing players, Tebow was released by the New York Jets in late April following a disappointing season as a backup to Mark Sanchez. \n  \n The Jets traded a pair of draft picks to Denver in the March 2012 deal to acquire Tebow but failed to establish a consistent role in the offense for the versatile quarterback, who attempted just eight passes, rushed for 102 yards on 32 carries and was used mostly to protect the punter. \n  \n \"Unfortunately, things did not work out the way we all had hoped,\" Jets coach Rex Ryan said in a statement when Tebow was released. \n  \n Tebow helped the Broncos win the AFC West in 2011 and beat Pittsburgh in a wild-card playoff game before being traded to New York when Denver signed Peyton Manning. \n  \n Tebow's NFL career appeared over this offseason when the Jets couldn't trade him at draft time and wound up cutting the left-handed quarterback, who won the 2007 Heisman Trophy at Florida. There even was speculation he couldn't get an offer from any Canadian Football League teams. ||||| Tim Tebow may still have a future in the NFL after all. \n  \n FILE - In this Dec. 17, 2012, file photo, then-New York Jets quarterback Tim Tebow warms up before an NFL football game in Nashville, Tenn. Tim Tebow is joining the New England Patriots, according to... (Associated Press) \n  \n The New England Patriots seem to think so and plan to sign him on Tuesday if he passes a physical. \n  \n He won't be a starting quarterback, of course, with Tom Brady on hand in Foxborough. But certainly he's an intriguing reclamation project _ yet another chance for coach Bill Belichick to torture the New York Jets, who failed to find a role for Tebow last season. \n  \n And that could make for quite a Boston Tea-bow Party. \n  \n A person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press on Monday that Tebow will join the Patriots' minicamp on Tuesday and sign with the team, pending the medical exam. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because no official announcement had been made. Even when Tebow signs, there is no guarantee he will play for the Patriots. \n  \n ESPN first reported that Tebow would sign with New England. \n  \n Former Broncos general manager Ted Sundquist sees the logic in the move. \n  \n \"If you can find a club that's mature enough to handle it as an organization, then you're going to find the right spot for him,\" Sundquist said. \"What I mean by that is all the media mania and that sort of thing. The club says, 'Look, this is the reason we're bringing him on. We feel he can bring X, Y, Z and A, B, C to the table.' Explain it to Tim, explain it to the media, explain it to your fan base and explain it to your organization.\" \n  \n That description seems to fit New England perfectly. \n  \n One of the NFL's most polarizing players, Tebow spent a lost season in 2012 with the New York Jets, playing sparingly behind struggling starter Mark Sanchez. Some fans thought he got a raw deal and deserved more of a chance; others thought he lacked the skills to be a pro quarterback. He was released in April with barely a shrug _ hardly the ending most Jets fans envisioned considering his super-hyped welcome to the Big Apple. \n  \n Tebow won two national titles at Florida and was a first-round draft pick in 2010 by Denver. As a rookie, Tebow threw just 82 passes in nine games, starting three. But in 2011, he started 11 games, throwing for 12 touchdowns and six interceptions, and took the Broncos to a wild-card win over Pittsburgh before an AFC divisional playoff loss to New England, 45-10. \n  \n Despite the Broncos' playoff run, he was traded to New York the following offseason when Denver signed Peyton Manning. Tebow threw only eight passes for the Jets, completing six, ran 32 times for 102 yards and was used mostly to protect the punter. \n  \n \"Unfortunately,\" coach Rex Ryan said in a statement when Tebow was released, \"things did not work out the way we all had hoped.\" \n  \n The Patriots have Ryan Mallett as the backup to Brady; they released QB Mike Kafka on Monday. \n  \n Asked if Tebow had signed, Patriots spokesman Stacey James said, \"I do not anticipate any additional transactions to announce tonight.\" \n  \n Tebow's NFL career appeared over when the Jets couldn't trade him at draft time and wound up cutting the left-handed quarterback, who won the 2007 Heisman Trophy. But now he is headed to New England, where the man who drafted him as coach of the Broncos, Josh McDaniels, is an offensive assistant under Belichick. \n  \n And apart from winning Super Bowls, Belichick likes nothing better than sticking it to the Jets. He's had a running feud with Ryan for nearly four seasons, in part because Ryan once said he wasn't hired to kiss Belichick's rings. \n  \n Belichick was Jets coach for one day in 2000, infamously resigning with a hand-written note. He soon joined New England, and has been regularly beating the Jets for more than a decade. \n  \n Revitalizing Tebow's career would be another big step toward humiliating New England's archrival. \n  \n Tebow has been criticized for his throwing motion but has said he wants to play quarterback, not switch positions. Still, the Patriots might need help at tight end after Rob Gronkowski underwent a fourth operation for a broken forearm and faces back surgery. At 6-foot-3 and 236 pounds, Tebow has the size to play that spot. \n  \n Belichick values versatility in his players, having used wide receivers Troy Brown, Julian Edelman and Matthew Slater at defensive back when injuries hit that position. \n  \n Belichick also has been willing to gamble on players discarded by other teams. Some have succeeded, like wide receivers Wes Welker and Randy Moss and running back Danny Woodhead. Some haven't, including wide receiver Chad Johnson and defensive lineman Albert Haynesworth. \n  \n The media circus that surrounded Tebow in Denver and with the Jets also could be minimized by Belichick, who keeps a tight lid on players' interactions with reporters. \n  \n ___ \n  \n AP Sports Writers Dennis Waszak Jr., and Howard Ulman contributed to this story. |||||", "output": "Reports of the death of Tim Tebow's NFL career were perhaps at least premature: The controversial QB is set to sign with the New England Patriots, sources tell ESPN and the AP.

My first thought was: of course, I know this, I\u2019ve alway known this. My second: wait, should I have already been doing this? \n  \n Advertisement \n  \n The team behind Coco Loko, a chocolatey powder being peddled as a drug-free stimulant for $12.50 a bottle (they sell more than 40,000 of these per month!), would have you believe that snorting chocolate is a novel idea. Coco Loko\u2019s Orlando-based parent company, Legal Lean\u2014which sounds like an illegal weight-loss brand\u2014claims the product contains cacao powder as well as ingredients commonly found in energy drinks, such as gingko biloba, taurine and guarana. Legal Lean\u2019s founder is 29-year-old Nick Anderson, who told the Post that he first heard about the \u201cchocolate-snorting trend\u201d in Europe a few months ago. Now Anderson is convinced that snortable chocolate \u201cis the future.\u201d \n  \n In fact, snortable chocolate has been kicking around Europe for at least a couple years. In 2015 a Belgian chocolatier was selling a device that shoots two small bumps of cocoa powder up your nose for you. These chocolate snorting kits cost $109 a pop. \n  \n Also, given how passionate people are about chocolate and sticking substances up their noses, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s been tried since long before any of us were born. It only wasn\u2019t until very recently that you could pay too much money for the experience of sticking chocolate up your nose. And maybe in the future it truly will be socially acceptable to emerge from a club bathroom with brown stuff all over your nose. I kind of doubt it, but I\u2019m willing to be wrong. ||||| You may have seen stories about people snorting chocolate on your social media timelines. \n  \n The stories led to chatter in the ABC10 newsroom about whether or not \"snortable\" chocolate was a real product in the U.S. \n  \n So, ABC10 set out to verify if chocolate powder for the nose could be found at a store near you. \n  \n It turns out, a product called Coco Loko was launched in the U.S. about two weeks ago by a company called Legal Lean, according to Nick Anderson, owner of the business. \n  \n Coko Loco is \"infused raw cacao snuff.\" Essentially, it's just cacao powder infused with energy boosters such as guarana and taurine, and a couple other natural cacao enhancers. The product looks like hot cocoa powder or chocolate milk powder and is intended to be ingested through the nose. \n  \n The Orlando-based company claims, Coco Loko results in an endorphin rush which mimics a \"runner's high\" and can also produce a euphoric energy \"similar to the feeling of ecstasy.\" The product is marketed to people looking to party and who want an extra shot of energy. The company even claims athletes use the powder to obtain a \"natural competitive edge.\" \n  \n Anderson explained, Coco Loko gives the rush of eating a candy bar or a piece of chocolate cake, without the sugar crash. \n  \n Coco Loko cacao snuff (Photo: Legal Lean) \n  \n Snorting cocoa or cacao powder isn't a new trend. It's been a popular \"drug\" choice in European clubs for years. \n  \n \"We wanted to create a new product that's marketable,\" Anderson said. \n  \n Retailers, such as WalMart, Target and Amazon, already sell raw cacao in the U.S. Cacao is the purest form of chocolate and is considered a superfood for being high in antioxidants. It is not the same thing as cocoa, which is processed at higher heat. \n  \n Coco Loko is the first cacao powder product to be sold in the U.S. specifically for the use of snorting. \n  \n So why can't you just buy cacao powder at a retail store and ingest it through your nose? Why is Coco Loko any different? \n  \n It's not. \n  \n \"We're marketing to a niche market that wants convenience,\" Anderson said. \"We want to make it the cool thing.\" \n  \n Anderson explained, Coco Loko is sold in small, 1.25 ounce jars that are designed to pop into a person's pocket. This way, if a person wants to use it while out in a club, they can do so easily. \n  \n The reason for snorting the product is to feel the effects immediately, according to Anderson. Coco Loko can be mixed with milk or a beverage but it takes longer to feel the effects, which isn't convenient for the person out and about looking for some fun. \n  \n \"I could see all demographics buying it but younger people are usually more open to trying it than older people,\" Anderson said. \n  \n Although Coco Loko is intended to snort while out partying, similar to drugs such as cocaine and MDMA, better known as Molly, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) doesn't regulate the cacao powder. \n  \n In fact, DEA spokesperson, Casey Rettig, told ABC10 she'd never heard of the product. The DEA only regulates products which contain Schedule I through V drugs. Cacao powder is not on any of the lists. \n  \n ABC10 also reached out to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), who released this statement: \n  \n \"The FDA is not prepared to issue a determination regarding whether and how this product is subject to FDA jurisdiction at this time.\" said Peter Cassell, FDA spokesperson. \"In reaching that decision, FDA will need to evaluate the product labeling, marketing information, and/or any other information pertaining to the product\u2019s intended use.\" \n  \n While Coco Loko is a legal product, it's not being regulated by the government and there are no current studies on the effects of snorting the cacao powder. \n  \n \"We don't know what it does to the nose,\" said Dr. Toby Steele, ENT-otolaryngologist with University of California, Davis. \n  \n Steele explained, in general, anything going up the nose other than nasal saline can damage mucus membranes, which help trap bacteria and other harmful particles entering the nose. \n  \n The nose could also become irritated or experience blockage. \n  \n \"What I would worry about the most is loss of sense of smell,\" Steele said. \n  \n Losing the sense of smell could be potentially dangerous since it serves as a warning in certain situations such as a fire or natural gas leak. \n  \n Steele doesn't recommend ingesting the cacao powder product through the nose. \n  \n \"If a patient asked me if they should do it, I'd say no,\" Steele said. \n  \n Coco Loko isn't available in California stores yet. Anderson didn't have a date for when the product will hit California shelves but said it'd be \"very soon.\" \n  \n However, the product is sold online for $24.99/1.25 oz. jar and is currently on sale for $19.99. \n  \n VERIFY: Sources \n  \n Nick Anderson, owner of Legal Lean \n  \n Casey Rettig, spokesperson for U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, San Francisco Division \n  \n Peter Cassell, spokesperson for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \n  \n Dr. Toby O.

The product, created by Orlando-based company Legal Lean, includes cacao powder, as well as gingko biloba, taurine and guarana, which are commonly found in energy drinks. \n  \n Nick Anderson, the 29-year-old founder of Legal Lean, says he heard about a \u201cchocolate-snorting trend\u201d in Europe a few months ago. He ordered a sample and gave it a try. \n  \n \u201cAt first, I was like, \u2018Is this a hoax?,'\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd then I tried it and it was like, okay, this is the future right here.\u201d \n  \n Each tin of Coco Loko comes with 10 servings and costs $24.99. (Courtesy of Legal Lean) \n  \n That led him to invest $10,000 into creating his own \u201craw cacao snuff.\u201d It took about 10 tries over two months to come up with the mixture, which was created by an Orlando-based supplement company. \n  \n \u201cSome versions, they just burned too much,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cOther times they looked gray and dull, or didn\u2019t have enough stimulants.\u201d \n  \n The effects of the cacao-based powder, he said, last about 30 minutes to an hour, and are \u201calmost like an energy-drink feeling, like you\u2019re euphoric but also motivated to get things done.\u201d \n  \n But doctors say they\u2019re not quite sure what to make of the brown powder, which hit U.S. shelves last month and is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. \n  \n \u201cThe question is, what are the risks of doing it?\u201d said Dr. Andrew Lane, director of the Johns Hopkins Sinus Center. \u201cThere\u2019s no data, and as far as I can tell, no one\u2019s studied what happens if you inhale chocolate into your nose. When I mention it to people, nobody\u2019s ever heard of it.\u201d (\u201cMaybe,\u201d he added, \u201cI\u2019m not in the in-crowd.\u201d) \n  \n Lane said he wasn\u2019t particularly worried that \u201csnortable\u201d chocolate could become a gateway drug, as users become accustomed to getting a buzz by inhaling powders. \n  \n \u201cIf you\u2019re going to do drugs, you probably don\u2019t start with chocolate,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly this is better than using an illicit drug.\u201d \n  \n The medical community has long raised concerns about the health effects of energy drinks \u2014 which often rely on caffeine, taurine and guarana, and have been shown to raise blood pressure and cause heart palpitations. Lane says those effects could be magnified if a person inhales those stimulants. \n  \n [FDA report describing deaths sheds light on high-caffeine beverages] \n  \n \u201cThere are a few obvious concerns,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst, it\u2019s not clear how much of each ingredient would be absorbed into the nasal mucus membranes. And, well, putting solid material into your nose \u2014 you could imagine it getting stuck in there, or the chocolate mixing with your mucus to create a paste that could block your sinuses.\u201d \n  \n A spokesman for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it had not decided whether, or how, the agency would regulate the product. \n  \n \u201cIn reaching that decision, FDA will need to evaluate the product labeling, marketing information, and/or any other information pertaining to the product\u2019s intended use,\u201d spokesman Peter Cassell said in an email. \n  \n A representative for the Drug Enforcement Administration, meanwhile, said he was not aware of any agency concerns related to chocolate inhalants. \n  \n Tins of Coco Loko, which have about 10 servings, sell for $24.99. Anderson, whose brother is a rapper named Bezz Believe, says the product is popular in the hip-hop community and near college campuses in Houston and Atlanta. \n  \n Anderson says he uses the chocolate powder as an alternative to drinking when he goes out. He also reaches for a tin during long car rides, music festivals and in \u201cthose types of social situations when you feel anxious.\u201d \n  \n He created his company, Legal Lean, two years ago with a $10,000 investment. The idea, he said, was to create a drug-free version of \u201clean\u201d \u2014 a cough syrup-cocktail often made with promethazine or codeine that is known in hip-hop circles as \u201cpurple drank.\u201d His grape-flavored version, formulated over three months, is made with herbal extracts and marketed as a \u201cdietary supplement.\u201d \n  \n It was a tough sell at first, Anderson says. People weren\u2019t sure what to make of his syrup-y concoction. But his brother soon began hawking it in YouTube music videos, and they began taking it to trade shows, where it generated interest. Today, the company sells 40,000 to 50,000 bottles of Legal Lean (which retail for $12.50 a pop) each month. \n  \n (The reviews on online message boards, meanwhile, are mixed: \u201cAll I felt was drowsy,\u201d a user named BodyAndBeats wrote on drugs-forum.com. \u201cPut me right to sleep.

That's the thinking behind Coco Loko, a new \"snortable\" chocolate powder billed as a legal way to get high, the Washington Post reports. The newfangled nose candy leaves snorters with a \"euphoric\" feeling \"but also motivated to get things done,\" per founder Nick Anderson. He likens the buzz, which lasts for 30 minutes to an hour, to that of an energy drink. The 29-year-old Anderson, who runs the company Legal Lean, says he got the idea for Coco Loko a few months ago after hearing about a \"chocolate-snorting trend\" in Europe.

The problem is that, regardless of Obama's stated intentions, he can't actually do this without an act of Congress. \n  \n As Dorinda Bordlee, an attorney with the Bioethics Defense Fund, wrote: \"If a president could do that, there would be no need to have a majority of Congress pass the Hyde Amendment each and every year to prevent abortion funding using Medicaid dollars for low-income government health care. Instead, we could have simply prevailed on each president to issue an executive order saying agencies can't use Medicaid money for abortion. Congress controls the purse strings, not the president. That's Civics 101.\" \n  \n It is telling that the nation's largest abortion provider -- Planned Parenthood -- is claiming \"victory\" because \"we were able to keep the Stupak abortion ban out of the final legislation and President Obama did not include the Stupak language in his executive order.\" \n  \n Several supporters of the bill have argued that this debate is otherwise irrelevant because abortions aren't performed at CHCs. While currently true, this doesn't mean that CHCs wouldn't like to offer abortion among their reproductive services. \n  \n Under the new law, they can. There's nothing to stop them. \n  \n Here's why. By statute, CHCs are required to provide all \"required primary health care services,\" defined to include \"health services related to . . . obstetrics or gynecology that are furnished by physicians.\" \n  \n Federal courts long have held that when a statute requires provision of health services under such broad categories, then the statute must be construed to include abortion unless it explicitly excludes it. Voil\u00e0. \n  \n One may believe that poor women should have affordable access to abortion. This is a reasonable position and it is likely to be the result of this bill. But it is not what Americans have been led to believe is true, nor is it what most want. A January Quinnipiac University poll found that 67 percent of Americans oppose public funding for abortion, down from 72 percent in December. \n  \n Prediction: Abortions will be performed at community health centers. You can bet your foreclosed mortgage on that. There was always a will by this administration, and now there's a way. \n  \n -- \n  \n In a recent column I wrote that Margaret Chase Smith was the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate. She was the first elected to both houses. The first woman elected to the Senate was Hattie Caraway of Arkansas. \n  \n kathleenparker@washpost.com \n  \n For more on the debate over abortion and health care, read Rep. Bart Stupak on \"Why I voted for health-care reform.\" ||||| When I saw that Kathleen Parker's March 24 op-ed, \"Stupak's original sin,\" defined me as a \"backstabber,\" it reminded me of a Bible verse. Matthew 7:3 asks, \"Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?\" \n  \n The true motives of many blogs and organizations claiming to be pro-life have become clear in recent days: to politicize life issues as a means to defeat health care reform. One group even sent an e-mail to supporters saying they are \"working feverishly to stop this legislation from going forward.\" \n  \n The pro-life groups rallied behind me -- many without my knowledge or consent -- not necessarily because they shared my goals of ensuring protections for life and passing health-care reform but because they viewed me as their best chance to kill health-care legislation. \n  \n Last November, an amendment I introduced succeeded in making sure the House health-care-reform bill contained the current law prohibiting public funding for abortions. I was disappointed that the Senate could not pass my language and only mustered 45 pro-life votes, far short of the 60 votes needed to keep the amendment intact. \n  \n Many of my Democratic pro-life colleagues and I worked tirelessly in the days leading up to the final House vote on health-care reform to strengthen the legislation's restrictions on abortion funding. We proposed numerous procedural and legislative options, but ultimately all of our efforts required the 60 votes we could not obtain in the Senate. \n  \n Once it was clear that the House leadership would eventually obtain the 216 votes necessary to pass health-care reform, I was left with a choice: Vote against the bill and watch it become law with no further protections for life or reach an agreement that prevents federal funding for abortions. \n  \n Therefore, I and other pro-life Democrats struck an agreement with President Obama to issue an executive order that would ensure all Hyde Amendment protections would apply to the health-care reform bill. No, an executive order is not as strong as the statutory language we fought for at the start. We received, however, an \"ironclad\" commitment from the president that no taxpayer dollars will be used to pay for abortions. \n  \n Throughout history, executive orders have carried the full force and effect of law and have served as an important means of implementing public policy. Perhaps the most famous executive order was the Emancipation Proclamation signed by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863. More recently, in 2007, President George W. Bush signed Executive Order 13435, restricting embryonic stem-cell research. This executive order protected the sanctity of life and was \"applauded\" and \"welcomed\" by pro-life advocates. That these same people would now claim that President Obama's executive order maintaining the sanctity of life is not worth the paper it is written on is disingenuous at best. \n  \n Some, including Parker, have criticized Obama's executive order as unenforceable in the courts and therefore just a \"fig leaf.\" Yet the language that critics point to is standard language with any executive order, including Bush's ban on embryonic stem-cell research. Again, many of these pro-life groups did not express concern over the Bush language but claim it is unacceptable under Obama. \n  \n To further protect against federal funding for abortion, during floor debate on the health-care reform bill I engaged in a colloquy with Rep. Henry Waxman to make clear congressional intent that the provisions in the bill, combined with the executive order, will ensure that outcome. Such colloquies are often referred to in court cases when an attempt is being made to determine Congress's intent. This, too, was no minor concession by those opposed to our efforts, and it is a tremendous victory for those protecting the sanctity of life. \n  \n I have said from the start that my goal was to see health-care reform pass while maintaining the long-standing principle of the sanctity of life. The president's executive order upholds this principle and current law that no federal funds be used for abortion. I and other pro-life Democrats are pleased that we were able to hold true to our principles and vote for a bill that is pro-life at every stage of life and that provides 32 million Americans with access to high-quality, affordable health care. \n  \n The writer is a Democratic representative from Michigan. |||||", "output": "Bart Stupak and Kathleen Parker take the fight over abortion funding to the op-ed pages of the Washington Post today.

The announcement drew worldwide condemnation, including remarks by President Obama, who in a nationally televised interview asked Jones to reconsider, saying the burning could lead to \"serious violence\" against American troops in Muslim nations.Later, Jones said on the \"Today\" show that he had changed his mind, and would not burn the holy book, saying he had successfully exposed the more radical strains of Islam.\"We will definitely not burn the Koran, no,\" he said, adding that he would \"absolutely guarantee\" that there would never be a Koran burning at his church.In an email statement released Friday, Jones did not say why he changed his mind yet again.

Some of them were clearly armed and they stormed into the building.\" \n  \n He said the security guards tried their best to halt the demonstrators' advance, but were overwhelmed. \n  \n Le Roy said it was not clear that the United Nations was the target. \"It happened to be the U.N. because the U.N. is on the ground.\" \n  \n Five demonstrators were killed in the violence; one person's throat was cut, he said. \n  \n A U.N .source said the dead included four Nepalese security guards as well as U.N. workers from Norway, Sweden and Romania. \n  \n The U.N. Security Council met Friday and issued a statement condemning the attack, which occurred at the operations center of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), and calling on the Afghan government to investigate. \n  \n Haji Sakhi Mohammad, a businessman in Mazar-e-Sharif, said that the incident began after Friday prayers, when many people joined a protest against the burning of the Quran. People calling \"Death to America\" marched to the U.N. compound and broke in, he said. At that, gunfire broke out and \"I saw protesters shot to death.\" \n  \n A student in Mazar-e-Sharif said he and his friends joined the protesters, who numbered in the hundreds. \"When we reached the UNAMA office, we came under gunfire by Afghan security guards. Protesters became angry and stormed the building.\" \n  \n The student said some of the protesters found several loaded AK-47s and used them to kill security guards and other people inside the building. \n  \n The attack followed a demonstration against the reported burning of a Quran by Florida pastor Terry Jones, who gained international attention last year when he announced that he was planning to burn a Quran, the U.N. source with knowledge of events said. \n  \n Jones is the pastor of the 60-member Dove World Outreach Center church near Gainesville. Last year, after an outcry followed his announcement of plans to burn a Quran on the ninth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, he canceled them. Last month, however, he reportedly did burn Islam's holy book. \n  \n The church says on its website that it planned to put the Quran on trial on March 20, and, \"if found guilty of causing murder, rape and terrorism, it will be executed!\" Another post on the website, which uses an alternative spelling for the book, says \"the Koran was found guilty\" during the mock trial and \"a copy was burned inside the building.\" \n  \n On Friday, Jones said in an e-mailed statement that the attack in Afghanistan shows that \"the time has come to hold Islam accountable.\" \n  \n \"We must hold these countries and people accountable for what they have done as well as for any excuses they may use to promote their terrorist activities,\" he said. \n  \n Atta Mohammad Noor, the governor of Balkh province, said the attackers had used the protests against the burning \"as a cover for this violence.\" \n  \n Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai called the attacks \"an act against Islam and Afghan values.\" \n  \n NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said the victims were only trying to help the Afghan people. \n  \n \"In targeting them, the attackers have demonstrated an appalling disregard for what the U.N. and the entire international community are trying to do for the benefit of all Afghans,\" he said. \n  \n U.S. President Barack Obama also condemned the attack. \"We stress the importance of calm and urge all parties to reject violence and resolve differences through dialogue,\" he said. \n  \n White House spokesman Jay Carney said he would not speculate on the motivation behind the attack, but added that it was \"in no way justified, regardless of what the motivation was.\" \n  \n The Council on American Islamic Relations also released a statement condemning the attack. \"Nothing can justify or excuse this attack,\" said the group, which describes itself as America's largest Muslim civil liberties and advocacy organization. \n  \n CNN's Tim Lister and journalist Fazel Rashad contributed to this story. |||||", "output": "The Florida pastor whose burning of a Koran last month set off a deadly protest in Afghanistan today called the deaths \"very tragic\" but expressed no remorse about his stunt, reports the Los Angeles Times.

Among those birds, a handful of bald eagles were spotted. \n  \n It was earlier this week county solid waste workers found two bald eagles lying on the side of the landfill. They were immediately treated by the Animis Foundation. \n  \n Animal caretakers with Animis say the eagles were very lethargic and needed oxygen and fluids to flush out their systems. One of the eagles later died, the other is recovering. Tests are still being done at the Audubon's Birds of Prey Center in Maitland where the animals were taken. But caretakers at Animis say they\u2019ve done tests of their own before, and always come back with the same answer. \n  \n \u201cThey showed symptoms of pentobarbital poisoning which we have seen previously with other eagles we have picked up from the same place,\" Animis caretaker Danielle Ball said. \n  \n That poison is what\u2019s given to animals when they are euthanized. \n  \n At the foot of the landfill sits the Marion County Animal Shelter. \n  \n \u201cThe belief is the animals that are being brought to the landfill are not being given the proper burials or handled in the right way, which is leading to the eagles having access to them,\u201d fellow Animis caretaker Mark Quadrozzi said. \n  \n U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services and Florida Fish and Wildlife investigators were at the landfill Friday trying to see if that's the case. \n  \n Solid Waste Director Mike Sims said whenever they are notified they are getting a delivery of animals, they dig a hole at least 3 feet down into the landfill, exceeding state standards of 2 feet. \n  \n Sims said the animals are then quickly buried by other trash in accordance with state statute in part to protect birds of prey. \n  \n \u201cWe\u2019re as much concerned about this and we want to get to the bottom of this if it is our facility. So we are going to cooperate with any agency that is going to come and investigate,\u201d said Sims. \n  \n The investigation was prompted by an outpouring on social media after the Animis Foundation publicized their beliefs about the cause of the eagles' illness. \n  \n \u201cI feel like everybody working together we can solve this problem and make Marion County a safe place for our national bird,\u201d Quadrozzi said. \n  \n Investigators say any findings could be turned over to the U.S. Department of Justice. \n  \n Marion County Animal Services points out the animals they euthanize account for less than a third of the animals that go in the landfill each year. \n  \n Solid Waste said its also investigating whether businesses and residents are properly notifying landfill operators they are bringing in animals to be buried. \n  \n  ||||| Animis Foundation medical assistant, Danielle Ball, gives fluids and oxygen to two rescued eagles found at the Marion County Baseline Landfill on Monday, February 2, 2015. \n  \n Animis Foundation caring for an eagle that was found two years ago.

She said the results were disturbing. Test results showed the eagle had been poisoned with pentobarbital, a drug commonly used by veterinarians to euthanize animals. \n  \n Pentobarbital is a barbiturate, which slows the activity of the brain and nervous system. \n  \n Whitfield said the eagles are eating the dead animals that have been discarded by the shelter; therefore, the pentobarbital is being passed onto the eagles. \n  \n Now, residents want to know if the animals are being discarded like trash instead of incinerated. Questions about whether or not the drug could seep into the aquifer have also been raised. \n  \n \u201cAnimis contacted authorities two years ago when we made the discovery. We were under the impression that Audubon would be testing all eagles and reporting the findings to the Florida Wildlife Service (FWS),\u201d said Whitfield. \u201cYesterday, I found out that nobody has been testing the birds. All of the proper authorities were notified, but nothing has been done.\u201d \n  \n On February 2, 2015, two additional bald eagles were found near death at the Baseline Landfill. The eagles were treated for poisoning. Once stabilized, they would be transported to the Audubon Center for Birds of Prey. This makes a total of 10 bald eagles in the past two years that has been found at the landfill. \n  \n Marion County officials released the following statement: \n  \n \u201cThis afternoon, we were made aware of citizen concerns expressed on social media and via emails regarding two distressed bald eagles found at the county landfill facility on Monday. While bird and eagle sightings are not uncommon at landfills, we don\u2019t frequently encounter distressed wildlife at our facility. In these situations, however, addressing the animals\u2019 well-being becomes staff\u2019s first priority. On that day, Solid Waste immediately contacted a wildlife rehabilitator licensed by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC), per FWC protocol. As of today, Solid Waste has reached out to the FWC and the rehabilitator for continued updates. The cause of the eagles\u2019 distress is not known or confirmed by any official tests at this time.\u201d \n  \n ### \n  \n The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation (FWC), initially, was not involved with this investigation. In fact, the FWC was not even made aware of the situation until February 4, when county officials called the FWC and began to ask questions about Animis. \n  \n In an attempt to discredit Animis, the county wanted to know if Animis was associated with FWC, which they are not. Animis is its own licensed entity; however, FWC wanted to make it clear that Animis is on FWC\u2019s approved list of wildlife animals rescue rehabilitators. Animis frequently rescues animals for the FWC if an officer with FWC is not available. \n  \n Greg Workman, Regional Public Information Coordinator for the FWC said, \u201cAlthough we are not heading up this investigation, it is a very serious matter. Bald eagles are federally protected; therefore, this case was turned over to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). Because it is federal, we felt it would be better serviced if handled by FWS.\u201d \n  \n Rumors began to spread through social media the moment Animis posted the story on Facebook, and people quickly began to confuse FWC and FWS, which are two separate agencies. It should be clear that FWC is not the lead in the investigation and was at no point made aware of the situation until yesterday. \n  \n Gavin G. Shire, Chief of Public Affairs with FWS, said \u201cUSFWS Special Agents in Florida are conducting a preliminary inquiry with Florida Wildlife Conservation Commission investigators to address this issue.\u201d \n  \n In a report published by FWS it states, \u201cEach year a number of bald and golden eagles, other wildlife, and domestic dogs are intoxicated or killed after ingestion of pentobarbital residues in the tissue of exposed euthanized carcasses. Exposure of these carcasses is almost always the result of improper disposal at landfills.\u201d \n  \n Ocala Post reached out to the Marion County Animal Shelter and asked what their procedure was for discarding euthanized animals. As always with Marion County officials, Ocala Post never received a reply. \n  \n Mara Burger, Public Information Specialist with the Department of Enviromental Protection (DEP), said, \u201cThe proper disposal of domestic animals is covered by Rule 62-701.520(4)(c), which allows disposal in Class I landfills or on the property where they died. Proper disposal is defined as \u201cburied at least two feet below land surface and above the water table.\u201d \n  \n The DEP has not yet responded to Ocala Post\u2019s questions in regards to whether or not there would be an investigation against the Marion County Baseline Landfill. \n  \n Ocala Post also contacted the EPA; we are waiting on a response. \n  \n Ocala Post received a formal copy of the results from the toxicology performed on the bald eagles by Andreas Lehner, Ph.D., an Analytical Chemist with Michigan State University. The results stated, \u201cThere was a moderate amount of pentobarbital, which fits the presumed diagnosis.\u201d \n  \n [Updated February 5, 2015, at 8:30 p.m.] \n  \n Ocala Post was notified earlier today that one of the bald eagles passed away. The other is still recovering. \n  \n Ocala Post was also contacted by several former employees of the Marion County Animals Shelter that wish to do an interview. Stay tuned for those details. \n  \n [Updated February 5, 2015, at 9:32 p.m.] \n  \n Marion County Public Information Manager, Barbra Hernandez posted the following on Ocala Post\u2019s Facebook page: \n  \n \u201cWe want to provide you the latest updates regarding the bald eagles located at the landfill facility on Monday. Today, we were able to speak with staff at the Audubon Center for Birds of Prey, who notified us that one of the eagles continues to recover at their facility. Unfortunately, we were saddened to learn that the other eagle did not make it. Audubon Center staff also confirmed that, as of today, no official toxicology tests have been performed. This information was also shared by Dr. Kennedy, veterinarian for the Animis Foundation, with whom we spoke today. Throughout the day, we have received several citizen inquiries regarding the burial of deceased animals at the landfill facility. We know many of you have questions about our Solid Waste and Animal Services policies for handling and properly burying deceased animals. Please know that our departments operate under strict state regulations and county guidelines. We would like to share with you additional information about our practices here: http://marioncountyfl.org/home/showdocument?id=6589.\u201d \n  \n How does Solid Waste handle deceased animals at the landfill? \n  \n Step 1: Deceased animals are transported (whether by individual, agency or business) to the landfill\u2019s inbound scale and reported to Solid Waste staff. Scale personnel notify the operators on the landfill. \n  \n Step 2: Operators excavate a hole at least 3 feet or more in depth, exceeding state statute requirements for a hole to be at least 2 feet in depth. \n  \n Step 3: The vehicle containing the deceased animal(s) is brought near the excavated hole for depositing. The landfill operator completes the deposit and covers with materials excavated from creating the hole. \n  \n Step 4: Operators continue to push and pack materials over the surface until end of work day. \n  \n Step 5: On closing, operators cover all areas on which they worked with a 6-inch dirt cover or a tarp, both methods authorized by the FDEP permit. \n  \n When a pet owner brings their pet in to be euthanized, the pet owner would have the choice of taking the body of the animal home, or allow the animal to be discarded with the trash at the landfill. \n  \n [Updated February 6, 2015, at 10:46 p.m.] \n  \n After this story went viral, Elaine DeIorio McClain, Public Information Officer for the Marion County Office of Public Information, responded to Ocala Post\u2019s information request. However, the response contained information Ocala Post had previously included in the article. \n  \n Stay tuned to Ocala Post for updates, as Ocala Post is waiting on further correspondence from FWS. ||||| This collection contains web crawls performed as the post-inauguration crawl for part of the End of Term Web Archive, a collaborative project that aims to preserve the U.S. federal government web presence at each change of administration.

And they tell the Ocala Post they can explain the phenomenon: The eagles, a rep for the Animis Foundation suggests, have been eating euthanized animals left in the landfill, and the chemicals used in euthanasia have been transferred to the birds. Their allegations come after a dying eagle tested two years ago was found to have pentobarbital in its system; pentobarbital is often used to euthanize animals. Marion County, which runs the shelter, has defended itself against the allegations and says its solid waste team buries euthanized animals in accordance with state law, offering a fact sheet explaining its processes. Addressing the discovery of two eagles on February 2, county officials say as soon as they were made aware of the issue, they contacted a state-licensed wildlife rehabilitator (Animis is not licensed by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, but is on the FWC's list of approved rehabilitators). The officials note that \"the cause of the eagles\u2019 distress is not known or confirmed by any official tests at this time,\" but tests are being done and Animis claims the eagles showed \"symptoms of pentobarbital poisoning,\" News 13 reports. One of those eagles died, while the other is still being treated, the Post notes. The US Fish and Wildlife Service says that such situations arise every year, with both wildlife and pets affected by eating \"exposed euthanized carcasses.\" \"Exposure of these carcasses is almost always the result of improper disposal at landfills,\" FWS adds.
