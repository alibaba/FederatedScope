I wouldn't make a plan to pay my bills primarily from savings. We need a plan, your plan, that addresses necessary cuts, responsible use of the reserve, and NEW REVENUE sources. Stick to your guns and hold the legislature accountable for their dismal performance and lack of leadership. Face it our great state is going to tank if they don't wake up and support a real plan to finance this state now and in the future.", "output": "Agree", "category": "Toxic Language Detection 952.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms.

I applaud the lady who had the guts to speak up about, most especially because she is not 'white.'.     \n\nDisgusting use of my tax dollars.  I have no kids but if I did you can be assured I would be going into the classroom removing my kid while politely denouncing this curriculum as the reverse racism it is.  All the while telling the innocent and beautiful children that we are all equal and deserving of respect and should offer compassion for each other.   \n\nAs for grocery stores, when the demand is there they supply it.  I noticed in my city there has been a real uptick in cultural offerings.  I think that is great, but I had no idea we were supposed to pander to such nonsense.   Why well intentioned dolts always seem to make matters worse is beyond me.", "output": "Agree", "category": "Toxic Language Detection 952.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms.

It's dishonest in that it seeks to control, sanitize, and marginalize the appropriated culture.\n\nThe \"Write what you know\" dictum is akin to the Oracle at Delphi's statement on Socrates. Was he the smartest Greek? He thought he didn't know anything and set about to find out how little he did know.\n\nPicasso said Art is a lie that tells the truth. Writers need to know they're lying and to be wary about whether their finished story tells the truth or just perpetuates a lie.\n\nNo one is worried about the appropriation of English culture or French culture. It's the appropriation of oppressed cultures that matters. Indigenous cultures, cultures of people of colour, marginalized peoples, and those discriminated against have all been victimized a second time by having their stories colonized by their oppressors. \n\nIt does not do a disservice to note the culture of the author.
