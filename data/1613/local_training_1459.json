Passage:He went out with the Baptist Missionary Society as a missionary doctor in 1935 to Pimu hospital, DRC in what was then the Belgian Congo. He was at Pimu Hospital, Province of \u00c9quateur until 1946, most of the time as the only doctor there (TLM, The Leprosy Mission started working there in 1944). He remained in the Belgian Congo in World War II. In 1930 there had been 30 Protestant missionaries in the Congo, but by 1939 Dr. Price was one of only five left. Although Belgium had been invaded by the Nazis, the Belgian government in exile in London continued to control the Congo and its valuable resources. In 1944 he published a paper on the grammar of the Ngombe language (one of the languages of Equateur Province) and thereafter contributed to the updating of the British and Foreign Bible Society's 1930 Ngombe New Testament, which was republished in 1956. In 1947 he was sent on a sabbatical to the UK by the Baptist Missionary Society to specialise as an orthopaedic surgeon (FRCS Ed. 1947). Returning to the Congo he went first to Sona Bata mission (part of the American Foreign Baptist Mission Society (A.F.B.M.S.), now American Baptist International Ministries), which already had a medical aide training school, and where he was tasked with helping to build Kimpese hospital. Kimpese hospital was set up by the protestant missions in the Congo as an interdenominational training hospital for medical auxiliaries. A Protestant hospital at Kimpese had first been mooted in 1923 (there had been an Evangelical training Institute there since 1909), but was strongly resisted by the Roman Catholic Church.. Before the war, the Belgian colonial government had refused to subsidise any Protestant educational enterprise, even the training of medical aides (the sole exception was the BMS medical aides training school at Yakusu). After the war this policy was reversed by the Socialist governments of Achille Van Acker and Protestant establishments were subsidised on the same basis as Catholic ones. As a result the Protestant IME (Institut Medical Evangelique) Kimpese could be opened. He was at IME Kimpese as an orthopaedic surgeon 1947-1956. He was succeeded in this post, as he had been at Pimu by Dr David Hedley Wilson, later the first President of the Royal college of Emergency Medicine. IME Kimpese \"became rapidly known throughout the lower Congo river and beyond for the high standard of its nursing school and hospital\".

Passage:Banks's division technically belonged to George McClellan despite serving as an independent command in the Shenandoah Valley. On March 14, 1862, President Lincoln issued an executive order forming all troops in McClellan's department into corps. Banks thus became a corps commander, in charge of his own former division, now commanded by Brig. Gen Alpheus Williams and the division of Brig. Gen James Shields, which was added to Banks's command. After Stonewall Jackson was turned back at the First Battle of Kernstown on March 23, Banks was instead ordered to pursue Jackson up the valley, to prevent him from reinforcing the defenses of Richmond. When Banks's men reached the southern Valley at the end of a difficult supply line, the president recalled them to Strasburg, at the northern end. Jackson then marched rapidly down the adjacent Luray Valley, and encountered some of Banks' forces in the Battle of Front Royal on May 23. This prompted Banks to withdraw to Winchester, where Jackson again attacked on May 25. The Union forces were poorly arrayed in defense, and retreated in disorder across the Potomac River and back into Maryland. An attempt to capture Jackson's forces in a pincer movement (with forces led by John Fr\u00e9mont and Irvin McDowell) failed, and Jackson was able to reinforce Richmond. Banks was criticized for mishandling his troops and performing inadequate reconnaissance in the campaign, while his political allies sought to pin the blame for the debacle on the War Department.\n", "output": "b", "category": "Answerability Classification 860.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it, i.e., the proper nouns in the passage.

Passage:This extended training period meant that he had accumulated 138 flying hours in his pilot's logbook before he finally joined No. 66 Squadron RFC in Italy on 10 March 1918. He was assigned to \"C\" Flight, flying a Sopwith Camel single seat fighter, and became the preferred wingman of fellow Canadian ace Billy Barker. Birks' first aerial victory came on 18 March, when he destroyed a Rumpler reconnaissance aircraft over Pravisdomini, killing an Austro-Hungarian pilot named Shneeberger. Six days later, he set another reconnaissance aircraft on fire, killing the crew of Poelzi and Suski. His third victory would not come until 2 May, when he wounded Leutnant K. Kosiuski and drove him into a crash landing that destroyed his Albatros D.V. Two days later, Birks shot down and killed ace Oberleutnant Karl Patzelt, as well as F. Frisch. In addition to killing both Austro-Hungarian pilots, he destroyed both their Albatros D.Vs; they were credited as \"captured\" because they fell within Italian lines. The new ace shot down another D.V in flames a week later, on 11 May. He destroyed two Berg fighters in five minutes on a morning patrol on 19 May. The following day, he destroyed another. On 24 May, while flying with Barker, Birks was credited with shooting down Hungarian ace J\u00f3zsef Kiss of Flik 55J; Birks thus became a double ace. On 9 June Birks set another Albatros D.V on fire in mid-air. On the 21st, he capped his list of triumphs by destroying another D.V over Motta. Most unusually for a British pilot, he had no \"soft\" victories, such as \"driven down out of control\".\n", "output": "b", "category": "Answerability Classification 860.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it, i.e., the proper nouns in the passage.

Quacker talks a lot compared to Tom and Jerry. His voice is a 'duck voice' not dissimilar to Disney's Donald Duck. In many shorts, he is the only character who speaks. He is very trusting, even trusting Tom in many situations in which Tom wishes to eat him. He is a friend of Jerry, but unlike Jerry harbors no hard feelings towards Tom. He appeared in The Tom and Jerry Show episode \"The Lost Duckling\" (1975). He also got his own series of shorts on The Yogi Bear Show (renamed Yakky Doodle) after guesting in several Hanna-Barbera TV shows.

Passage:During the expedition, Father Cresp\u00ed observed a location along the river that would be good for a settlement or mission. However, in 1771, Father Serra instead commissioned two missionaries to establish the Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel-San Gabriel Mission near the present day Whittier Narrows section of the San Gabriel River. The missionaries encountered resistance from the Tongva to their attempts to resettle the Natives on the mission. The mission encountered further trouble in 1776 when a flood damaged the mission, convincing the missionaries to move and rebuild the mission on a higher and more defensible location: its present site in San Gabriel. The first Spanish governor of Las Californias, Felipe de Neve had, as well, recommended to Viceroy Bucareli Father Cresp\u00ed's location on the R\u00edo Porci\u00fancula (Los Angeles River) for a mission. Instead, in 1781, King Charles III mandated that a pueblo be built on the site instead, which would be the second town in Alta California, after San Jos\u00e9 de Guadalupe in 1777. The monarch, disregarding the production and trade roles of the missions, saw a greater need for secular pueblos to be established as the centers of agriculture and commerce to supply the crown's ever-growing military presence in \"Nueva California.\" The priests at the missions ignored the royal mandate and continued their ranching, trading and production of tallow, soap, hides, and beef, often in competition with new pueblo ventures.\n", "output": "b", "category": "Answerability Classification 860.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it, i.e., the proper nouns in the passage.

Passage:This town was strategically located at a junction of trade routes between the Mediterranean Sea and the North Sea regions, and the Rhine and Danube rivers. In 1200, Freiburg's population numbered approximately 6,000 people. At about that time, under the rule of Bertold V, the last duke of Z\u00e4hringen, the city began construction of its Freiburg M\u00fcnster cathedral on the site of an older parish church. Begun in the Romanesque style, it was continued and completed 1513 for the most part as a Gothic edifice. In 1218, when Bertold V died, then Egino V von Urach, the count of Urach assumed the title of Freiburg's count as Egino I von Freiburg. The city council did not trust the new nobles and wrote down its established rights in a document. At the end of the thirteenth century there was a feud between the citizens of Freiburg and their lord, Count Egino II of Freiburg. Egino II raised taxes and sought to limit the citizens' freedom, after which the Freiburgers used catapults to destroy the count's castle atop the Schlo\u00dfberg, a hill that overlooks the city center.

Passage:Parschau was assigned the Fokker A.III aircraft bearing both the Fokker factory serial number 216 and the IdFlieg military serial number of A.16/15. This airplane had previously been flown by Oberleutnant Waldemar von Buttlar. This unarmed monoplane had been privately purchased in 1913 by von Buttlar. It was requisitioned by the Fliegertruppe and von Buttlar was commissioned as an officer in the German Army at the outbreak of hostilities. The airplane was painted in a shade of green that was the same as that used by von Buttlar's previous Marburg-based J\u00e4ger Regiment 11. Parschau had served with the same, Brieftauben-Abteilung Ostende unit, abbreviated as BAO in German military communications of the time, in Belgium as Oberleutnant von Buttlar did in November 1914, where the two German officers could have first made contact. As A.16/15 still bore the green color of von Buttlar's old unit, the aircraft became distinctive as Parschau's 'Green Machine', right from the outbreak of World War I. Parschau flew this machine on a roving commission for nearly a year, serving with FFAs 22 and 42 and the aforementioned \"BAO\" unit, which was actually a group of four FFA units operating as one for the Oberste Heeresleitung or OHL, the World War I German Army's High Command office. In this period, Parschau flew his distinctive machine on the Champagne front during October and November 1914. Following this were periods in Flanders and Alsace-Lorraine before Parschau was posted first to West Prussia and then on to Galicia on the Eastern Front. His travels were marked on the Fokker's fuselage. In late May 1915, this airplane was the first one to be fitted with a workable synchronization gear: the Fokker Stangensteuerung synchronizer, along with a Parabellum MG 14 machine gun for its armament. This airplane functioned as the prototype Fokker Eindecker for Parschau's use and combat evaluation.\n", "output": "b", "category": "Answerability Classification 860.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it, i.e., the proper nouns in the passage.

Passage:The general outline of the Roman conquest of Britain during the 1st century AD is recorded by historical sources; for the involvement of specific forts historians depend on archaeological excavations. This part of Britain was occupied by a tribe known as the Cornovii. In AD 46\u201347 the Roman Army led by governor Aulus Plautius had probably occupied the lands to the south of the River Trent. Late in 47 the new governor of Britain, Ostorius Scapula, began a campaign against the tribes of the western mountains (modern Wales). Caratacus, their leader, was defeated in battle in AD 50 and fled to the Brigantes who occupied the Pennines. Their queen, Cartimandua, came to terms with the Romans and handed Caratacus over to them. Ostorius died and was replaced by Aulus Gallus who brought the Welsh borders under control but did not move further north or west. It was at about this time that the fort at Strutt's Park was built. It probably lay not far south of the border between Roman territory and that held by the Brigantes, who were now an allied or subject kingdom.\n", "output": "b", "category": "Answerability Classification 860.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it, i.e., the proper nouns in the passage.

Passage:Superblocks are also used when functional units such as rail yards or shipyards, inherited from the 19th and early 20th centuries, are too big to fit in an average city block. A contemporary function which reflects ancient practices that also requires larger than typical blocks is the sports stadium or arena. Just as the Colosseum in ancient Rome, sports complexes require superblocks. The Providence Park stadium in Portland, for example, takes up four normal city blocks as does the equally large Greensboro Coliseum in North Carolina. Other contemporary institutions, establishments or functions that use superblocks are: city halls like Government Center, Boston and Toronto City Hall; regional general hospitals or specialized medical centres; convention and exhibition centers, such as Exhibition Place in Toronto and the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center; and downtown enclosed Shopping Malls such as Eaton Centre in Toronto, echoing the large gallerias of the 19th century. Cultural complexes, such as the Lincoln Center in New York City, often occupy a superblock achieved through the consolidation of regular city blocks.

Passage:In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the hook-billed vanga in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected on the island of Madagascar. He used the French name L'\u00e9corcheur de Madagascar and the Latin Collurio Madagascariensis. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the hook-billed vanga. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Lanius curvirostris and cited Brisson's work. It is now the only species placed in the genus Vanga that was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1816.

Passage:Still wines from the Champagne region were known before medieval times. The Romans were the first to plant vineyards in this area of north-east France, with the region being tentatively cultivated by the 5th century. In fact, cultivation was initially slow due to the unpopular edict by Emperor Domitian that all colonial vines must be uprooted. When Emperor Probus, the son of a gardener, rescinded the edict, a temple to Bacchus was erected, and the region started to produce a red, light, and fruity wine that contrasted with heavier Italian brews often fortified with resin and herbs. Later, churches owned vineyards and monks produced wine for use in the sacrament of Eucharist. French kings were traditionally anointed in Reims, and champagne was served as part of coronation festivities. The Champenois were envious of the reputation of the wines made by their Burgundian neighbours to the south and sought to produce wines of equal acclaim. However, the northerly climate of the region gave the Champenois a unique set of challenges in making red wine. At the far extremes of sustainable viticulture, the grapes would struggle to ripen fully and often would have bracing levels of acidity and low sugar levels. The wines would be lighter bodied and thinner than the Burgundy wines they were seeking to outdo.\n", "output": "a", "category": "Answerability Classification 860.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it, i.e., the proper nouns in the passage.

Passage:A deliberate use of acoustic feedback was pioneered by Blues and Rock'n'Roll guitarists such as Willie Johnson, Johnny Watson and Link Wray. According to AllMusic's Richie Unterberger, the very first use of feedback on a commercial rock record is the introduction of the song \"I Feel Fine\" by the Beatles, recorded in 1964. Jay Hodgson agrees that it was the first chart-topper to showcase feedback distortion, created by John Lennon leaning a semi-acoustic guitar against an amplifier. The Who's 1965 hits \"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\" and \"My Generation\" featured feedback manipulation by Pete Townshend, with an extended solo in the former and the shaking of his guitar in front of the amplifier to create a throbbing noise in the latter. Canned Heat's \"Fried Hockey Boogie\" (off of their 1968 album Boogie with Canned Heat) also featured guitar feedback produced by Henry Vestine during his solo to create a highly amplified distorted boogie style of feedback.

Passage:Kepler's first major astronomical work, Mysterium Cosmographicum (The Cosmographic Mystery, 1596), was the first published defense of the Copernican system. Kepler claimed to have had an epiphany on July 19, 1595, while teaching in Graz, demonstrating the periodic conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in the zodiac: he realized that regular polygons bound one inscribed and one circumscribed circle at definite ratios, which, he reasoned, might be the geometrical basis of the universe. After failing to find a unique arrangement of polygons that fit known astronomical observations (even with extra planets added to the system), Kepler began experimenting with 3-dimensional polyhedra. He found that each of the five Platonic solids could be inscribed and circumscribed by spherical orbs; nesting these solids, each encased in a sphere, within one another would produce six layers, corresponding to the six known planets\u2014Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. By ordering the solids selectively\u2014octahedron, icosahedron, dodecahedron, tetrahedron, cube\u2014Kepler found that the spheres could be placed at intervals corresponding to the relative sizes of each planet's path, assuming the planets circle the Sun. Kepler also found a formula relating the size of each planet's orb to the length of its orbital period: from inner to outer planets, the ratio of increase in orbital period is twice the difference in orb radius.

Passage:In the 1970s, astronomers saw some major advances in astronomical imaging technology, beginning with Antoine Labeyrie's invention of speckle interferometry, a process that significantly reduced the blurring effect caused by astronomical seeing. It increased the optical resolution of ground-based telescopes, allowing for more precise measurements of Betelgeuse's photosphere. With improvements in infrared telescopy atop Mount Wilson, Mount Locke and Mauna Kea in Hawaii, astrophysicists began peering into the complex circumstellar shells surrounding the supergiant, causing them to suspect the presence of huge gas bubbles resulting from convection. But it was not until the late 1980s and early 1990s, when Betelgeuse became a regular target for aperture masking interferometry, that breakthroughs occurred in visible-light and infrared imaging. Pioneered by John E. Baldwin and colleagues of the Cavendish Astrophysics Group, the new technique employed a small mask with several holes in the telescope pupil plane, converting the aperture into an ad-hoc interferometric array. The technique contributed some of the most accurate measurements of Betelgeuse while revealing bright spots on the star's photosphere. These were the first optical and infrared images of a stellar disk other than the Sun, taken first from ground-based interferometers and later from higher-resolution observations of the COAST telescope. The \"bright patches\" or \"hotspots\" observed with these instruments appeared to corroborate a theory put forth by Schwarzschild decades earlier of massive convection cells dominating the stellar surface.\n", "output": "b", "category": "Answerability Classification 860.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it, i.e., the proper nouns in the passage.

Passage:In August 1914, Luxemburg, along with Karl Liebknecht, Clara Zetkin and Franz Mehring, founded the Die Internationale (\"The International\") group which became the Spartacus League in January 1916. They wrote illegal anti-war pamphlets pseudonymously signed Spartacus after the slave-liberating Thracian gladiator who opposed the Romans. Luxemburg's pseudonym was Junius, after Lucius Junius Brutus, founder of the Roman Republic. The Spartacus League vehemently rejected the SPD's support in the Reichstag for funding the war, and sought to lead Germany's proletariat towards an anti-war general strike. As a result, Luxemburg and Liebknecht were imprisoned in June 1916 for two and a half years. During imprisonment, Luxemburg was twice relocated, first to Posen (now Pozna\u0144), then to Breslau (now Wroc\u0142aw). smuggled out and illegally published her articles. Among them was The Russian Revolution, criticising the Bolsheviks, presciently warning of their dictatorship. Nonetheless, she continued to call for a \"dictatorship of the proletariat\", albeit not of the one party Bolshevik model. In that context, she wrote the words \"Freiheit ist immer die Freiheit des Andersdenkenden\" (\"Freedom is always the freedom of the one who thinks differently\") and continues in the same chapter: \"The public life of countries with limited freedom is so poverty-stricken, so miserable, so rigid, so unfruitful, precisely because, through the exclusion of democracy, it cuts off the living sources of all spiritual riches and progress\".

For instance, there's the man on fire from Wish You Were Here, another wearing the Delicate Sound of Thunder lightbulb suit, dolls of the Atom Heart Mother cow and the Animals pig, a bike and both a brick wall and the hammers from The Wall. Eventually Thorgerson opted to make two images, with another used for the back cover.

Passage:Upon his return from abroad in 1698, Peter the Great began preparations for the war with Sweden. The first Russian regular regiments consisted of the so-called datochniye lyudi (lifelong conscripts), later combined with the okhochiye lyudi (volunteers). Peter managed to muster 27 regiments formed into three divisions (9 regiments each). Generals Adam Veyde, Avtonom Golovin and Anikita Repnin were appointed commanders of these divisions. Soldiers had to learn how to use weapons and master military formations in accordance with Veyde's Military Charter (1698). Foreign officers were in charge of this training, which caused Golovin's anger. He used to say that they couldn't hold a musket in their hands, didn't know their business, had to be taught themselves, and that it was all a waste of time. Soon, Peter the Great had to decline their services and put inexperienced Muscovite sluzhiliye lyudi in charge of the training. In 1700, Golovin formed 8 infantry regiments and one dragoon regiment (one division). During the Battle of Narva, the Russian army was defeated by Charles XII. Golovin's division (which consisted of recruits only) was one of the first ones to flee the battlefield. Field Marshal Charles Eug\u00e8ne de Cro\u00ff and all of the foreign officers in the Russian army surrendered to the Swedes. They were soon followed by Generals Yakov Dolgoruky, tsarevich Alexander Imeretinsky, Avtonom Golovin and Ivan Buturlin, who had decided to capitulate, as well. As a result, almost all of the commanding officers were taken prisoners and the Swedes captured all of the Russian artillery, which Peter the Great had been assembling piece by piece from all over Russia. Golovin was taken to Stockholm and remained there for the next 18 years. The tsar was only able to exchange him in 1718. In 1719 and 1720, Golovin took part in the structuralization of the Russian army. \n", "output": "b", "category": "Answerability Classification 860.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it, i.e., the proper nouns in the passage.

South of the Douro, another border county would be formed decades later when what would become the County of Coimbra was conquered from the Moors by Hermenegildo Guterres. This moved the frontier away from the southern bounds of the county of Portugal, but it was still subject to repeated campaigns from the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba. The recapture of Coimbra by Almanzor in 987 again placed the County of Portugal on the southern frontier of the Leonese state for most of the rest of the first county's existence.

The procession, led by the Kanephoros, made its way to the Areopagus and in front of the Temple of Athena Nike next to the Propylaea. Only Athenian citizens were allowed to pass through the Propylaea and enter the Acropolis. The procession passed the Parthenon and stopped at the great altar of Athena in front of the Erechtheum.

After overtaking his teammate during the start, he was asked to yield and let Vettel pass. He eventually finished the Chinese Grand Prix in 5th. In Azerbaijan, he was the favourite for pole position until a crash in the second qualifying session ended his contention. He started 8th after penalties for the two Alfa Romeos and finished the race 5th with an extra point for the fastest lap of the race. At the following race in Monaco, he qualified 16th, as part of Ferrari's erroneous strategy that kept him in the garage to save tyres, underestimating track evolution at the end of the qualifying session. He was however promoted to 15th following Antonio Giovinazzi's grid penalty. He overtook Lando Norris and Romain Grosjean but suffered a puncture after a failed attempt to pass the Renault of Nico H\u00fclkenberg. He also suffered severe floor damage to his car, leading to his second retirement at his home race. Leclerc qualified 3rd in Canada, ahead of Daniel Ricciardo in the Renault and behind Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes. He would finish in the same position, his second podium finish of the season and of his career, behind the controversial 1-2 finish of Hamilton and teammate Sebastian Vettel. He would finish third again in France, having caught up to second-placed Bottas in the closing laps. At the Austrian Grand Prix, he qualified on pole position, the second pole of his Formula 1 career.

The Series lasted eight games, due to a 6\u20136 tie in Game 2 when the game was called by darkness after 11 innings. Engle had appeared twice before during the Series in pinch-hitting duties. In Game 6, he hit a two-run RBI double off Giants pitcher Rube Marquard that scored Boston's only runs in a 5\u20132 losing effort. The decisive Game 8 at Fenway Park faced Joe Wood for Boston and Christy Mathewson for the New York Giants, who had broken a 1\u20131 tie by scoring a run in the first half of the 10th inning. The Red Sox started its half and manager Jake Stahl sent Engle to pinch-hit for pitcher Wood. Then, he hit a fly ball off Mathewson that came toward CF Snodgrass, who dropped the ball. Snodgrass made a fine catch on the next batter, Harry Hooper, but Mathewson walked Steve Yerkes, gave a single to Tris Speaker, and Engle went on to score the tying run.

Passage:The Battle of Ia Drang was the first major battle between the United States Army and the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN), also referred to as the North Vietnamese Army (NVA), and was part of the Pleiku Campaign conducted early in the Vietnam War. It comprised two main engagements, centered on two previously scouted helicopter landing zones (LZs), known as LZ X-Ray and LZ Albany. The first involved the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment and supporting units under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore, and took place November 14\u201316, 1965 at LZ X-Ray, located at the eastern foot of the Chu Pong Massif in the central highlands of Vietnam. The second engagement involved the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment plus supporting units under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Robert McDade, and took place on November 17 at LZ Albany, farther north in the Ia Drang Valley. It is notable for being the first large scale helicopter air assault and also the first use of Boeing B-52 Stratofortress strategic bombers in a tactical support role. Surrounded and under heavy fire from a numerically superior force, the American forces at LZ X-ray were able to hold off and drive back the North Vietnamese forces over three days of battle, largely through the support of both air power and heavy artillery bombardment, which the North Vietnamese lacked. LZ X-ray was considered an American tactical victory, as the Americans were able to exact an almost 10:1 kill ratio. At LZ Albany, the American forces were ambushed in close quarters. They were unable to use air and artillery support due to the close engagement of the North Vietnamese, the American forces were badly defeated, suffering an over-50% casualty rate before being extricated from the battle.

On 27 May 1940, chief-of-staff of the High Command of the German armed forces, Wilhelm Keitel, wrote to Canaris that the Brandenburgers had \"fought outstandingly well\" which was further validated when Hitler presented Iron Cross commendations to 75 percent of the 600 men who participated.

Passage:A solar cell, or photovoltaic cell (PV), is a device that converts light into electric current using the photovoltaic effect. The first solar cell was constructed by Charles Fritts in the 1880s. The German industrialist Ernst Werner von Siemens was among those who recognized the importance of this discovery. In 1931, the German engineer Bruno Lange developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide, although the prototype selenium cells converted less than 1% of incident light into electricity. Following the work of Russell Ohl in the 1940s, researchers Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller and Daryl Chapin created the silicon solar cell in 1954. These early solar cells cost US$286/watt and reached efficiencies of 4.5\u20136%. In 1957, Mohamed M. Atalla developed the process of silicon surface passivation by thermal oxidation at Bell Labs.

Passage:Inside the SAPD, the first part of 1937 saw an intensification of differences over attitudes to a possible political party of the united left or a Popular front, and more precisely over the party's approach to the Soviet Union. The differences led to Peter Blachstein's exclusion from the SAPD. Others excluded at the same time included his political mentor and Erwin Ackerknecht: the three became the focus of a short-lived political grouping known as \"Neuer Weg\" (\"New Way\"). Blachstein was also affected more directly by the intense political tensions radiating out from Moscow, based on Stalin's suspicions - not entirely unfounded - that there might be comrades in the Soviet Union and further west in Europe who favoured an alternative Soviet leader. The POUM, of which Blachstein was a member, backed a broadly Trotskyite vision for a communist future and its members therefore became targets for Soviet agents. In June 1937 Blachstein was arrested in Barcelona by communist secret police and accused of spying for Franco and working for the Gestapo. With approximately 100 other foreign detainees he was taken to a large garage which had been adapted for use as an ad hoc prison. Because of the appalling hygiene he soon fell ill with Tuberculosis, as a result of which he was transferred to a sanatorium controlled by anarchist comrades.

Passage:Maurice had to continue the war against the Persians. In 586 his troops defeated them at the Battle of Solachon south of Dara. In 588, a mutiny by unpaid Byzantine troops against their new commander, Priscus, seemed to offer the Sassanids a chance for a breakthrough, but the mutineers themselves repulsed the ensuing Persian offensive. Later in the year they secured a major victory before Martyropolis. The Sassanid commander, Maruzas, was killed, several of the Persian leaders were captured along with 3,000 other prisoners, and only a thousand men survived to reach refuge at Nisibis. The Byzantines secured much booty, including the Persian battle standards, and sent them, along with Maruzas' head, to Maurice in Constantinople. In 590 two Parthian brothers, Vistahm and Vinduyih, overthrew King Hormizd IV and made the latter's son, Prince Khosrau II, the new King. The former Persian commander-in-chief, Bahram Chobin, who had rebelled against Hormizd IV, claimed the throne for himself and defeated Khosrau. Khosrau and the two Parthians fled to the Byzantine court. Although the Senate unanimously advised against it, Maurice helped Khosrau regain his throne with an army of 35,000 men. In 591 the combined Byzantine-Persian army under generals John Mystacon and Narses defeated Bahram Chobin's forces near Ganzak at the Battle of Blarathon. The victory was decisive; Maurice finally brought the war to a successful conclusion with the re-accession of Khosrau.\n", "output": "a", "category": "Answerability Classification 860.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it, i.e., the proper nouns in the passage.

One such Christian was John of Damascus (c. 676\u2013749 AD), who was familiar with Islam and Arabic. The second chapter of his book, The Fount of Wisdom, titled \"Concerning Heresies\", presents a series of discussions between Christians and Muslims. John claimed an Arian monk (whom he did not know was Bahira) influenced Muhammad and viewed the Islamic doctrines as nothing more than a hodgepodge culled from the Bible. Writing on Islam's claim of Abrahamic ancestry, John explained that the Arabs were called \"Saracens\" (Greek \u03a3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03af, Sarakenoi) because they were \"empty\" (\u03ba\u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2, kenos, in Greek) \"of Sarah\".

Passage:McGeoch was born on October 9, 1897 in Argyle, New York. He received his bachelor's degree from Westminster College in 1918, and a master's degree from Colorado College in 1919. His master's thesis, titled \"The Present Status of Psychology\", is a review of the history of the field of psychology and how the role of psychology was viewed in the early 20th century. He then studied under Harvey A. Carr at the University of Chicago. He studied a variety of topics while at the University of Chicago, including suggestibility and intelligence in delinquents, time perception, neuropsychological and vocational testing, and the reliability and validity of the Pressey X-O test. His doctoral dissertation was titled \"A study in the psychology of testimony.\" Following the completion of his dissertation, McGeoch\u2019s work primarily focused on human learning and memory. Harvey Carr significantly influenced McGeoch\u2019s work, and provided feedback on the McGeoch's introductory textbook on human learning, The Psychology of Human Learning, which was published after Carr\u2019s death in 1943. McGeoch completed his PhD while he was a faculty member at the University of Washington. He accepted a full Professor position 2 years later at the University of Arkansas. In 1930 he moved to the University of Missouri where he became the chair of the department of psychology. He held this position for 5 years before moving to Wesleyan University, where he was also chair of the department from 1935\u20131939 and was awarded an honorary degree in recognition of his accomplishments as a lecturer and administrator.

Passage:During the Morean War, monastery was in peril twice. Apparently, during the first plunder of Cetinje, after the Battle of Vrtijeljka, the forces of S\u00fcleyman Bushati did not gravely damage the monastery. Their idea was to pacify Montenegrins, and prevent them from aiding Venetian war effort. On the other hand, his army comprised a considerable amount of forcibly mobilised Christians, and he was afraid of mutiny. The popular tale has it that expeditionary force did start to rob the monastery, however, as one of the soldiers was trying to take down a cross from the top of the roof, he was struck by lightning, which was immediately perceived as Gods sign. In 1689, the Venetians were invited to take control of Cetinje. As they arrived, they quickly fortified themselves in the monastery and in the nearby former court of Crnojevi\u0107. It thus served as a garrison for three years, when Cetinje was attacked again by Suleyman on 25 September 1692. Instead of fighting, Venetians entered negotiations, and reached an agreement to abandon the monastery under honorable terms. However, they mined a monastery with a time bomb, which set of in the evening hours, right after Venetians retreated and as the Ottomans were victoriously entering the monastery, killing many of them in the process. This resulted in seat of Metropolitanate being moved to Dobrska \u0106elija monastery for some time. Vladika Danilo reestablished it, in 1701 or 1704, across the site of the first location, atop the remains of the court with stone from the old one, and added a tablet with the coat of arms of the Crnojevi\u0107 family, and a dedication to Ivan Crnojevi\u0107. Before 1714, it was burnt, and then it was reconstructed yet again around 1743 by Metropolitan Sava Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161. It was the center of spiritual, cultural and political life of the Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro. Its importance is clearly emphasised in Prince-Bishop Vasilije's exaggerated claim, written in his \"History of Montenegro\", that ... before its destruction, Cetinje Monastery was among the most beautiful monasteries in Europe. The last time monastery was devastated was in 1785, when Mahmud Pasha Bushati sacked Cetinje. Ultimately defeated in the Battle of Krusi, his severed head is since then kept as a relic in the monastery. It has been built on several times, the current appearance dates to 1927. The original site of the monastery, known as \u0106ipur (after Greek word \u039a\u03ae\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 - Garden) was used in 1886 by Prince Nicholas of Montenegro for his Court church.

Passage:The first obelisks may start to appear in the later 16th century and it is suggested that the obelisk on Compton Pike is Elizabethan in date. More securely dated is a series of obelisks which start to appear in the 18th century. The first of these was the Wakeman obelisk of 1702 by Nicholas Hawksmoor, which is set in the square at Richmond, Yorkshire. Probably several hundred obelisks exist in the British Isles dating from 18th and early 19th centuries. Most of these obelisks, which are often landmarks commemorate famous people and their achievements. At Stowe in Buckinghamshire an obelisk was erected in memory of Wolfe's victory at Quebec in 1752, while at the death of the Duke of Cumberland in 1765 was noted by an obelisk at Englefield Green in Surrey. Thomas Coke, Earl of Leicester, Coke of Norfolk the farming pioneer has a particularly fine obelisk, set up in the park he created at Holkham in Norfolk. Sometimes an obelisk was used to mark the site of a battle such as the obelisk on the site of English Civil War battlefield at Naseby in Leicestershire. Occasionally obelisks are used as mile markers, as on the Great North Road at a mile from Westminster.

Passage:Georges Sada was born in 1939 in Iraq into a Christian family of Assyrian ethnicity (see his account). As a boy, Sada attended the Assyrian Church of the East with his family, later becoming a 'born-again' Christian and attending a more evangelical church. Throughout his childhood, Sada had a keen interest in military aircraft and the Air Force, playing as a boy at the RAF Base where his father was stationed, and imagining himself flying the fighters he saw taking off. In this time he did 'odd jobs' at the base, befriending both the pilots and the technicians who repaired their aircraft, resolving that one day he himself would have a career in the Air Force as a pilot. In 1958 at the age of nineteen, Sada applied to the air academy in Iraq and was accepted as a cadet, graduating from the Iraqi Air Academy in 1959. Over the following years he served as an Air Force Officer, including periods studying overseas in Britain, the USSR and the United States. Between 1964\u20131965 he was a student at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas. Sada's career in the air force spanned 28 years, from 1958 to 1986. He officially retired in 1986 as a two-star officer, but was later called back to active service as an Air Vice Marshal for the 1990 invasion of Kuwait. During the conflict Sada defied the orders of Saddam Hussein by refusing to execute POWs, attributing this disobedience to his strong Christian convictions. In interviews, Sada has described his attempts to persuade Saddam not to harm the prisoners (an action which would have violated the Geneva Convention and would have been a war crime): Saddam eventually relented and spared the POWs, although Sada himself was subsequently imprisoned for a time. In his book Saddam's Secrets, Sada states that Saddam did not want him harmed after his release, but wanted no further contact with him thereafter.\n", "output": "b", "category": "Answerability Classification 860.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it, i.e., the proper nouns in the passage.

A stay in Paris also provided him with inspiration from Jules Dalou, Alexandre Falgui\u00e8re and Auguste Rodin.

Passage:Along with adjacent Newton County, Searcy is unique among Arkansas counties in being traditionally Republican in political leanings even during the overwhelmingly Democratic \"Solid South\" era. This Republicanism resulted from their historical paucity of slaves, in turn created by infertile soils unsuitable for intensive cotton farming, and produced support for the Union during the Civil War. These were the only two counties in Arkansas to be won by Alf Landon in 1936, Wendell Willkie in 1940, Charles Evans Hughes in 1916, and even Calvin Coolidge in 1924. In Presidential elections post-1932, Harry S. Truman and Jimmy Carter are the only Democrats to carry the county. In the 1992 election George H. W. Bush won his second-highest margin in the state, and the Republican nominee has received over 60 percent in Presidential elections from 2000 to 2012 inclusive.

Passage:With the increasing chaos and disorder leading to the collapse of the Roman Empire in 476, the popes assumed more and more civil authority first in Rome and in the surrounding territories. Rome became the center of the Catholic Church and the capital city of the Papal States; consequently, a great number of churches, convents and other religious buildings were erected in the city, sometimes above the ruins of older pre-Christian sites of worship. Churches proliferated during the Renaissance, when the Rome's most notable churches were built (this includes St. Peter's basilica on the Vatican Hill (the largest church in the world) and the city cathedral of St. John at the Lateran. The Papacy established its residence first in the Lateran Palace, then in the Quirinal Palace. When Rome was annexed by force to the newly unified Kingdom of Italy In 1870, Pope Pius IX retired to the Vatican, proclaiming himself a prisoner of the Savoy monarchy and leading to decades of conflict between the neonate state and the Catholic Church. This was resolved in 1929, when the Lateran Treaty were signed in Rome, establishing the right for the Holy See to govern the Vatican City as an independent, sovereign state.

Passage:Elysium was produced by Bill Block, Neill Blomkamp, and Simon Kinberg, and written and directed by Neill Blomkamp, the director and co-writer of District 9 (2009). It reunites Blomkamp with some of his District 9 crew, such as editor Julian Clarke, production designer Philip Ivey, cinematographer Trent Opaloch, and actor Sharlto Copley, playing one of the film's antagonists. Elysium is a co-production of TriStar Pictures and MRC. Although the film's story is set in 2154, Blomkamp has stated that it is a comment on the contemporary human condition. \"Everybody wants to ask me lately about my predictions for the future,\" the director has said, \"No, no, no. This isn't science fiction. This is today. This is now.\" In January 2011, independent studio Media Rights Capital met with major studios to distribute Elysium, and Blomkamp shared art designs of his proposed science fiction film. The art designs won over the executives at Sony Pictures, who bought the film after making a more attractive offer than the other studios. With a production budget of , production began in July 2011. The film's Earth-bound scenes were shot in a dump in the poor Iztapalapa district on the outskirts of Mexico City, while the scenes for Elysium were shot in Vancouver and the wealthy Huixquilucan-Interlomas suburbs of Mexico City. Matt Damon shaved his head for the role of Max. The main role was first offered to Watkin Tudor Jones (aka Ninja), a South African rapper, who despite being a fan of District 9 (he has a D9 tattoo on his inner lip) did not take the role. The role was then offered to rapper Eminem, but he wanted the film to be shot in Detroit. That was not an option for the two studios, so Blomkamp moved on to Damon as his next choice. Futuristic designs were executed by Philip Ivey after long periods of researching and studying older science fiction films. Ivey has continuously cited Syd Mead as a substantial influence for the film. Weta Workshop created the exosuits for Damon and Copley's characters, while the complicated visual effects were handled primarily by Image Engine (who also collaborated on District 9) with additional work by Whiskytree, MPC, The Embassy and Industrial Light and Magic. Re-shoots took place through October 2012. The film's music score was composed by newcomer Ryan Amon and recorded at Abbey Road Studios with the Philharmonia Orchestra.

Passage:On his second visit to Guatemala, in 1537, friar Bartolome de las Casas, O.P. wanted to employ his new method of conversion based on two principles: 1) to preach the Gospel to all men and treat them as equals, and 2) to assert that conversion must be voluntary and based on knowledge and understanding of the Faith. It was important for Las Casas that this method be tested without meddling from secular colonists, so he chose a territory in the heart of Guatemala where there were no previous colonies and where the natives were considered fierce and war-like. Because of the fact that the land had not been possible to conquer by military means, the governor of Guatemala, Alonso de Maldonado, agreed to sign a contract promising that if the venture was successful he would not establish any new encomiendas in the area. Las Casas's group of friars established a Dominican presence in Rabinal, Sacapulas and Cob\u00e1n, reaching as far as Chahal and including Cubulco. Through the efforts of Las Casas' missionaries the so-called \"Land of War\" came to be called \"Verapaz\", \"True Peace\". Las Casas's strategy was to teach Christian songs to merchant Indian Christians who then ventured into the area. In this way he was successful in converting several native chiefs, among them those of Atitl\u00e1n and Chichicastenango, and in building several churches in the territory named Alta Verapaz. These congregated a group of Christian Indians in the location of what is now the town of Rabinal. In 1538 Las Casas was recalled from his mission by Bishop Francisco Marroquin who wanted him to go to Mexico and then on to Spain in order to seek more Dominicans to assist in the mission.\n", "output": "b", "category": "Answerability Classification 860.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it, i.e., the proper nouns in the passage.

Passage:Za\u00efre was soon translated into English by Aaron Hill as Zara: A Tragedy. Following its successful run at London's Drury Lane Theatre in 1736, Zara became the most frequently staged English adaptation of a Voltaire play. Famous English actresses who have played the title role include Susannah Maria Cibber, who made her stage debut in the 1736 Drury Lane production, Sarah Siddons, and Elizabeth Younge. The first known professional performance of the play in the American Colonies was in Philadelphia on 26 December 1768, performed by the Hallam Company using the Aaron Hill version. The company took the play to New York City in 1769 and after the end of the Revolutionary War sporadically revived it there and in Philadelphia. The first professional performances after the hostilities ended were given in Baltimore in April 1782 by the Thomas Wall Company.

Passage:When Boris I assumed the throne of Bulgaria in 852, the country was still pagan, with the ruling Bulgar elite being Tengriists while the Slavic population practised its own religion. Christianity was already widespread in Bulgaria as the country was established on former territories of the Byzantine Empire, and seems to have been influential. Even one of the sons of Khan Omurtag (r. 814\u2013831), Enravota, converted to Christianity. The Bulgarian nobility was strongly opposed to any form of Byzantine influence in the country and was therefore hostile to Christianity as it was directly associated with the Byzantine Empire. Boris I, however, had many reasons to consider conversion\u00a0\u2014 Bulgaria was situated between two powerful Christian empires, Byzantium and East Francia; Christian doctrine particularly favoured the position of the monarch as God's representative on Earth; and finally, Boris also saw Christianity as a way to overcome the differences between Bulgars and Slavs. The geopolitical situation in the mid 9th century was also favourable because of the increasing friction and rivalry between the Papacy in Rome and the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople for influence in Central Europe. That struggle between the two churches would give the Bulgarian ruler the opportunity to manoeuvre and negotiate with both, thus extracting favourable concessions while keeping the country out of direct foreign influence. When the Byzantines invaded Bulgaria in the autumn of 863 and demanded conversion to Christianity from Constantinople as the single condition to retreat, Boris I readily accepted and was baptised in the beginning of 864, assuming the Christian name Michael after his spiritual godfather, the Byzantine Emperor Michael III. That step was very unpopular among the nobility, but when they rebelled Boris I dealt decisively with them and executed 52 magnates along with their whole families. When in the following year the Byzantines sturdily demonstrated their determination not to allow the existence of an autocephalous Bulgarian Church, Boris I decided to turn to the Papacy.\n", "output": "b", "category": "Answerability Classification 860.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it, i.e., the proper nouns in the passage.

Passage:In 1592, during the war with Spain, an English fleet had captured a large Portuguese galleon off the Azores, the Madre de Deus, loaded with 900 tons of merchandise from India and China, worth an estimated half a million pounds (nearly half the size of English Treasury at the time). This foretaste of the riches of the East galvanized interest in the region. That same year, Dutch merchants sent Cornelis de Houtman to Lisbon, to gather as much information as he could about the Spice Islands. In 1595, merchant and explorer Jan Huyghen van Linschoten, having traveled widely in the Indian Ocean at the service of the Portuguese, published a travel report in Amsterdam, the \"Reys-gheschrift vande navigatien der Portugaloysers in Orienten\" (\"Report of a journey through the navigations of the Portuguese in the East\"). The published report included vast directions on how to navigate ships between Portugal and the East Indies and to Japan. Dutch and British interest fed by new information led to a movement of commercial expansion, and the foundation of the English East India Company, in 1600, and Dutch East India Company (VOC), in 1602, allowing the entry of chartered companies in the so-called East Indies.\n", "output": "b", "category": "Answerability Classification 860.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it, i.e., the proper nouns in the passage.

Passage:In 1290 Hungarian King Ladislaus IV died leaving no heirs to the throne. The cousin of Ladislaus IV, Andrew III, was crowned King, despite the desire of the sister of the former King Ladislaus IV, Mary of Hungary, Queen of Naples, who wanted her son, Charles Martel as the new King in Hungary. The latter party had much more support, so Pope Nicholas IV had crowned Charles Martel as King of Hungary. This movement was supported by the most powerful Croatian nobility, the \u0160ubi\u0107s, Princes of Bribir. As the current head of the family, Paul \u0160ubi\u0107 was also son-in-law of King Stefan Dragutin, family connections made Kotroman support Charles Martel's crowning. To increase his influence in Kotroman's realm, Charles Martel issued numerous edicts to split the land among the lesser gentry to gain support for his reign. It appears that he gave the reign over Bosnia to the \u0160ubi\u0107s. Charles Martel died unexpectedly in 1295, before the campaign to cease the power in Hungary was finished. The Queen of Naples and sister of former King Ladislaus IV, Mary, had then decided to put her grandson, son of Charles Martel, Charles Robert as the future King of Hungary. Pope Boniface VIII declared the twelve-year-old boy as King Charles I of Hungary in 1297. Paul \u0160ubi\u0107 of Croatia declared himself as \"Dominus of Bosnia\" in 1299 and gave the title of Bosnian Ban to his brother, Mladen I \u0160ubi\u0107. All of Kotroman's land except for the Lower Edges, which was ruled by Prince Hrvatin Stjepani\u0107 as a vassal of the \u0160ubi\u0107s, was held by the House of \u0160ubi\u0107; as was confirmed by Charles I Robert. Paul \u0160ubi\u0107 wanted to bring King Charles Robert to Split across Croatia to Zagreb, which would become the main station of his campaign against King Andrew III of Hungary. During the preparations for war, Andrew III died unexpectedly. Charles Robert assessed the Hungarian throne, but had to fight numerous opponents to his regime up to 1309.\n", "output": "b", "category": "Answerability Classification 860.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it, i.e., the proper nouns in the passage.

Formed in 1967 after the disbandment of Los Gatos Salvajes, Los Gatos were the house band of the bar La Cueva, which became a popular meeting place for rock enthusiasts and the birthplace of Argentine rock\u2014known locally as rock nacional (Spanish for \"national rock\"). During the mid-to-late 1960s, Buenos Aires was experiencing a cultural blossoming characterized by innovations in modern art, literature and cinema, largely driven by a burgeoning youth subculture that adhered to the countercultural phenomenon of the decade. The underground had its center in La Cueva, Plaza Francia and the Torcuato di Tella Institute, and identified with British Invasion music and the sexual revolution. \"La balsa\" was written by Litto Nebbia\u2014lead vocalist of the band\u2014and Tanguito (credited as Rams\u00e9s) on May 2, 1967, in the men's toilet of La Perla de Once, another bar frequented by the group.

Passage:Perhaps the reason for the appeal of Turner\u2019s work outside the art world is that it pushes the boundaries of both film and politics. Perestroika has been noted by academics and critical thinkers for both its artistic form and commentary on environmental and social issues, most notably featuring in the essay volumes Performing Authorship: Self inscription and corporeality in the cinema and Screening Nature: Cinema Beyond the Human. For Cecilia Sayad, the film\u2019s importance lies in its structures: its function in highlighting the act of authorship as performance, and how the film\u2019s structural devices serve to emphasise the fictionality of narration, how the retelling, even of truth or fact, always and necessarily involves an element of creation and thus fiction. Sayad comments that whilst Perestroika ostensibly interweaves footage of a 2007\u201308 reconstruction of a train journey across Siberia that Turner took in 1987\u201388 with that from the original journey in what was then the USSR, it is as much about the workings of memory and filmmaking itself. But Sophie Mayer has commented on how the work uses the idea of pollution as a function of retention, and weaves it through both the social/cultural and natural worlds. Mayer goes further in exploring the contextual importance of the work, comparing Perestroika with works of the filmmakers Lucrecia Martel and Apichatpong Weerasethakul, commenting that each offers a \u2018utopian possibility of a post-capitalist, post-industrial, postcolonial moment\u2019. In a booklet of essays written to accompany the publication of Perestroika and perestroika:reconstructed in 2014, another academic, Paul Newland writes \u2018the artist explores the nature of representation and its problematical relationship to our experience of reality.

Passage:Gorham's Rangers was one of the most famous and effective ranger units raised in the colonial North America. Formed by John Gorham, the unit served as the prototype for many subsequent ranger forces, including the better known Rogers' Rangers. The unit started out as a Massachusetts provincial auxiliary company, which means it was not part of the province's normal militia system. Recruited in the summer of 1744 at the start of King George's War, Governor William Shirley ordered the unit raised as reinforcements for the then-besieged British garrison at Fort Anne in Annapolis Royal. Over the next eight years the unit proved remarkably effective at suppressing Acadian and Mi'kmaq resistance to British rule in Nova Scotia and helped to both expand and secure the British sphere of influence in the region. Initially a sixty-man all-Indian company led by British colonial officers, the original Native American members of the unit were gradually replaced by Anglo-Americans and recent Scots and Irish immigrants and were a minority in the unit by the mid-1750s. The company were reconnaissance experts as well as renowned for their expertise at both water-borne operations and frontier guerrilla warfare. They were known for surprise amphibious raids on Acadian and Mi'kmaq coastal or riverine settlements, using large whaleboats, which carried between ten and fifteen rangers each. This small unit was the main British military force defending Nova Scotia from 1744 to 1749. The company became part of the British army and was expanded during the Seven Years' War and went on to play an important role in fighting in Nova Scotia as well as participating in many of the important campaigns of the war, particularly distinguishing itself at the Siege of Quebec in 1759.\n", "output": "b", "category": "Answerability Classification 860.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it, i.e., the proper nouns in the passage.

The canoe plywood was shaped by hydraulic presses as an innovation devised by Haskell. The unusually designed canoe of no skeleton framework or ribs was given the brand name Arex (\"king of the water\") and made out of the Haskell Manufacturing Company building on N. Rowe Street in Ludington, Michigan. It later became better known just as the Haskell canoe. Haskell formed the Haskell Manufacturing Company in 1916 to make boats and canoes. He incorporated it with $100,000 in 1917.

Passage:\"Marry the Night\" is a dance-pop and synthpop song with electro rock and house influences. The song starts out with electronic church bells and Gaga softly singing \"I'm gonna marry the night/I won't give up on my life/I'm a warrior queen/Live passionately tonight.\" Soon the beat changes into a dance one, accompanied with techno beats, handclaps and funk music, and moves to the chorus, where Gaga stutters the line \"Ma-ma-ma-marry/Ma-ma-ma-marry/Ma-ma-ma-marry the night\". It was compared by Tim Jonze from The Guardian to the Eurodance song, \"It's My Life\" by Dr Alban, while Nicola James from MTV compared the chorus with Jennifer Lopez's 1999 single \"Waiting for Tonight.

Passage:The regeneration of the Ninth Doctor into the Tenth at the end of \"The Parting of the Ways\" (2005) used computer effects to morph Christopher Eccleston into David Tennant. In the episode of Doctor Who Confidential accompanying the episode \"Utopia\" (2007), where the same effect is used for the Master's regeneration, it is stated that the production team decided that this would be a common effect for all future Time Lord regenerations, rather than each regeneration being designed uniquely at the whim of the individual director. This style of transition is seen again in \"The Stolen Earth\"/\"Journey's End\" (2008) both when the Doctor undergoes an aborted regeneration, and when his hand spawns a clone in the second part; in The End of Time (2010) during which Matt Smith took over the role as the Eleventh Doctor; in \"The Impossible Astronaut\" when the Doctor is shot twice and seemingly killed; in \"Day of the Moon\" when a young girl regenerates; and in \"Let's Kill Hitler\" when Mels (Nina Toussaint-White) is shot and regenerates into River Song (Alex Kingston). \"The Night of the Doctor\" and \"The Day of the Doctor\" subsequently use the effect to show the Eighth Doctor and War Doctor's regenerations respectively. The Eighth Doctor's regeneration into the War Doctor uses steady beams of light as opposed to the flame effect used for other revived series regenerations. In the Series 10 episode \"The Lie of the Land\", the Twelfth Doctor fakes a regeneration as part of a plan to test if Bill still has free will. The effect used is consistent with the one used in the modern series, with the Doctor's hands glowing and emitting regeneration energy before he enters full regeneration. However, as the regeneration was not real, it did not use up a regeneration and the Doctor did not change bodies.\n", "output": "b", "category": "Answerability Classification 860.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it, i.e., the proper nouns in the passage.

Passage:The NFL forbids religious groups, governments, and non-profit organizations owning a team. The NFL requires a controlling owner to hold at minimum a 30% stake in the team and forbids ownership groups of over 24 people, or any publicly traded corporations from purchasing NFL teams; one team, the Green Bay Packers, is exempt from this under a grandfather clause and is owned by shareholders. The Houston Texans are also grandfathered in for their home county\u2013the Harris County, Texas government\u2013which owns 5% of the team, as the rule forbidding governments from owning a team became effective in 2007. The NFL's constitution also forbids its owners from owning any other professional football teams, except for Arena Football League teams located in the NFL team's home market. In addition, the controlling owners of NFL teams were previously only permitted to own major league baseball, basketball and hockey teams if they were in the NFL team's home market, or were not located in other NFL cities. (Stan Kroenke, who owned hockey and basketball teams in Denver, was nonetheless unanimously allowed to buy the then-St. Louis Rams in 2010 and hold on to his Denver assets until 2015. Even then, the Denver assets were transferred to his wife, Ann.) Soccer has been exempt from these restrictions since 1982, when the league lost a lawsuit filed by the original NASL stemming from the investments of Kansas City Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt and Elizabeth Robbie, the wife of Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie in NASL teams; as a result, NFL owners have owned teams in MLS in other NFL markets. In October 2018, the NFL owners voted to relax the cross-ownership rule, allowing controlling NFL owners to own other professional teams within NFL markets. The league also informally requires prospective owners to have relatively liquid assets and positive cash flow; having a majority of one's wealth invested in real estate, for example, is grounds for rejection.\n", "output": "a", "category": "Answerability Classification 860.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it, i.e., the proper nouns in the passage.

She was launched on 20 August 1910, and was commissioned on 2 January 1912. Including her armament, her cost is variously quoted at \u00a31,855,917 or \u00a31,918,773. Orion was assigned to the 2nd division of the Home Fleet as the flagship of Rear-Admiral Sir Herbert King-Hall, the division's second-in-command. The ship was slightly damaged on 7 January when the pre-dreadnought battleship broke loose from her moorings and collided with Orions bow. The division was redesignated as the 2nd Battle Squadron (BS) on 1 May. The ship, together with her sister ships and , participated in the Parliamentary Naval Review on 9 July at Spithead. They then participated in training manoeuvres. King-Hall was relieved by Rear-Admiral Rosslyn Wemyss on 29 October. On 13 November, the ship participated in comparative gunnery trials with Thunderer to evaluate the effectiveness of the latter's gunnery director. Thunderer decisively outshot Orion, although some of her success was because her director was above the smoke that obscured the target from Orions guns. The test was repeated in better conditions on 4 December and Orion performed much better, apparently beating Thunderer. The three sisters were present with the 2nd BS to receive the President of France, Raymond Poincar\u00e9, at Spithead on 24 June 1913 and then participated in the annual fleet manoeuvres in August.

Passage:Born in Tacoma, Washington to an attorney and his wife who were active New Deal Democrats, Elizabeth Binns wanted to be a lawyer from a young age. Her father sometimes allowed her to skip classes in order to watch him try cases; she graduated from the local public high school at age 16.

Passage:Nazism found an audience in the country, with pro-Nazi elements organised by Louis Weichardt in 1932 under the name South African Gentile National Socialist Movement, a group that soon became known as the Greyshirts. Although the group enjoyed some support and continued after the Second World War they never became sufficiently important for the government to take action against them. The other main fascist group was the Ossewabrandwag (OB), founded in 1939, a group also inspired by Adolf Hitler. The two differed however as the Greyshirts emphasised Aryan race rhetoric and so organised amongst the various white immigrant communities whilst the OB were specifically for Afrikaner only. A third, more minor group, the New Order, emerged in 1940 under the leadership of former cabinet minister Oswald Pirow. After the Second World War Pirow became an important figure in neo-fascism, working closely with Oswald Mosley, Nation Europa and A. F. X. Baron.

Passage:In 1825, Benedict Joseph Fenwick, S.J., a Jesuit from Maryland, became the second Bishop of Boston. He was the first to articulate a vision for a \"College in the City of Boston\" that would raise a new generation of leaders to serve both the civic and spiritual needs of his fledgling diocese. In 1827, Bishop Fenwick opened a school in the basement of his cathedral and took to the personal instruction of the city's youth. His efforts to attract other Jesuits to the faculty were hampered both by Boston's distance from the center of Jesuit activity in Maryland and by suspicion on the part of the city's Protestant elite. Relations with Boston's civic leaders worsened such that, when a Jesuit faculty was finally secured in 1843, Fenwick decided to leave the Boston school and instead opened the College of the Holy Cross west of the city in Worcester, Massachusetts where he felt the Jesuits could operate with greater autonomy. Meanwhile, the vision for a college in Boston was sustained by John McElroy, S.J., who saw an even greater need for such an institution in light of Boston's growing Irish Catholic immigrant population. With the approval of his Jesuit superiors, McElroy went about raising funds and in 1857 purchased land for \"The Boston College\" on Harrison Avenue in the Hudson neighborhood of South End, Boston, Massachusetts. With little fanfare, the college's two buildings\u2014a schoolhouse and a church\u2014welcomed their first class of scholastics in 1859. Two years later, with as little fanfare, BC closed again.

Passage:The Navajo War was not directly a part of the Black Hawk War, but it may have been a source of some of the native warriors who fought in the Black Hawk War. Black Hawk's success drew fighters from other Utes in Colorado, Apaches from New Mexico, and many Navajos. In the winter of 1866 Black Hawk and his band went to the Four Corners region where he received many new recruits. So many Navajos joined him that they formed almost half his raiders. The Navajo had been decimated by the U.S. Army under Kit Carson and forced out of their ancestral homeland. The remaining Navajos were eager for a chance to build up their herds at the expense of white settlers. Manuelito, the most important chief refusing to relocate to the Bosque Redondo Reservation, jointly led Black Hawk's raids on Mormon settlements in southern Utah during 1866. The attacks commenced at Pipe Springs, then a Mormon settlement on the Arizona-Utah border. The retaliation for the Pipe Springs raid left four unarmed Paiutes dead for murders they had nothing to do with. This brought some Paiute fighters to Black Hawk's band. Hopis hearing of the Navajo's movements feared they were to be attacked and struck first ambushing Manuelito's Navajos. The raids continued at the Paria settlements, and Kanab, who sent pleas for help against the raids. In subsequent years, the raids continued in the south by Navajos and Paiutes, which raised tensions to a fever pitch which would result in the worst massacre of the war at Circleville. Chief Kanosh predicted that in 1867 six thousand Navajos would wipe out the Mormon towns in southern Utah.\n", "output": "b", "category": "Answerability Classification 860.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it, i.e., the proper nouns in the passage.

The Swedes scored 3 goals in the first period which left Romania out of it. After a lopsided loss to Czechoslovakia (7\u20132) the team then took on USA. The US jumped out to a 2\u20130 lead in the first period and added two more to it to lead 4\u20131 after two periods. Unlike other teams that the US had faced, the Romanians fought strong in the third period, despite being outshot 15\u20133, and scored a goal. The final score was 7\u20132. Romania played Norway for their final game, who had lost all four of their past games and had no chance to advance to the Medal Round. Romania fell behind less than a minute into the game, but stormed back to take the lead 3\u20131 in the third period. The Norwegian team battled back though, and scored once with a minute and a half left to play, and scored once more to tie it with only 29 seconds left. This tie still gave Romania one point but they had been hoping for a win. They finished the tournament with a 1\u20133\u20131 record, and were ranked 8th out of 12, just beating the Netherlands, West Germany, Norway, and Japan. This was the last time that the Romanians competed in the Olympic tournaments.\n", "output": "a", "category": "Answerability Classification 860.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it, i.e., the proper nouns in the passage.

Passage:The 1880s saw an intense competition between the European powers for territories in Africa, a process known as the Scramble for Africa. The process culminated in the Berlin Conference of 1884, in which the European nations concerned agreed upon their respective territorial claims and the rules of engagements going forward. As a result of this France gained control of the upper valley of the Niger River (roughly equivalent to the areas of modern Mali and Niger). France had already conquered most of northern Algeria during the period 1830-47, incorporating it as an integral part of France. France occupied the area of modern Niger in 1900, declaring it a military territory, ruled originally from Zinder. Niger was originally included, along with modern Mali and Burkina Faso, within the Upper Senegal and Niger colony, however it was split off in 1911 and became a constituent of the federal colony of French West Africa (Afrique occidentale fran\u00e7aise, abbreviated AOF). In the meantime in Algeria France had been pushing south from the littoral region, conquering much of the Algerian Sahara in 1902. A boundary between French West Africa and French Algeria (i.e. what are now Algeria\u2019s borders with Mauritania, Mali and Niger) was agreed on 7 June 1905 by the Commandant of Upper Senegal and Niger and the Military Commander of the Department de l'Oasis within French Algeria. The border was further defined by the Niamey Convention of June 1909.\n", "output": "b", "category": "Answerability Classification 860.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it, i.e., the proper nouns in the passage.

Passage:The Allied occupation of Japan at the end of World War II was led by General Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, with support from the British Commonwealth. Unlike in the occupation of Germany, the Soviet Union was allowed little to no influence over Japan. This foreign presence marks the only time in Japan's history that it has been occupied by a foreign power. At MacArthur's insistence, Emperor Hirohito remained on the imperial throne. The wartime cabinet was replaced with a cabinet acceptable to the Allies and committed to implementing the terms of the Potsdam Declaration, which among other things called for the country to become a parliamentary democracy. Under MacArthur's guidance, the Japanese government introduced sweeping social reforms and implemented economic reforms that recalled American \"New Deal\" priorities of the 1930s under President Roosevelt. The Japanese constitution was comprehensively overhauled and the Emperor's theoretically-vast powers, which for many centuries had been constrained by conventions that had evolved over time, became strictly limited by law. The occupation, codenamed Operation Blacklist, was ended by the San Francisco Peace Treaty, signed on September 8, 1951, and effective from April 28, 1952, after which Japan's sovereigntywith the exception, until 1972, of the Ryukyu Islands was fully restored.\n", "output": "a", "category": "Answerability Classification 860.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it, i.e., the proper nouns in the passage.

Passage:The Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio-class frigates were passed to the Philippine Navy with fewer weapons aboard than they had had during their U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast guard careers and with old surface search radars installed. The Philippine Navy addressed these shortfalls through modernization programs. In Philippine service, Diego Silang retained her South Vietnamese armament, consisting of a single Mark 12 5\"/38 caliber (127-mm) gun, a dual-purpose weapon capable of anti-surface and anti-air fire, mounted in a Mark 30 Mod 0 enclosed base ring with a range of up to yards; two twin Mark 1 Bofors 40mm anti-aircraft gun mounts, four Mk. 4 single 20-millimeter Oerlikon anti-aircraft gun mounts, four M2 Browning .50-caliber (12.7-millimeter) general-purpose machine guns, and two 81-mm mortars. However, in 1979 Hatch and Kirk, Inc., added a helicopter deck aft which could accommodate a Philippine Navy MBB Bo 105C helicopter for utility, scouting, and maritime patrol purposes, although the ship had no capability to refuel or otherwise support visiting helicopters.

In 1646 he was appointed Field Crown Hetman. During the Khmelnytsky Uprising, he was captured by the Tatars after the Battle of Korsun in 1648. He was a prisoner-of-war until 1650 when he was ransomed. On 12 May 1651 he commanded victorious Polish army in the Battle of Kopyczy\u0144ce between Poles and combined Cossack-Tatar forces under chief Asand Demko. In 1651, during the subsequent hostilities between the Commonwealth and Cossack-Tatar alliance, he was the nominal commander of the Polish army right wing at the great victorious Battle of Beresteczko (de facto commanded Jeremi Wi\u015bniowiecki).

Passage:By the 1920s, SCGX was doubling annually and had emerged as the \"fastest growing grain market in the world\"; transacting 22 million bushels in 1928 (valued at $336 million in 2018), resulting from its location in the heart of the Corn Belt and self-imposed standards before the Grain Standards Act of 1916 including species admittance and non-mixing. However, its growth was limited by shipping rates. With the trucking industry and Interstate Highway System not yet developed, SCGX was constrained by monopolized railroad rates, primarily by the Great Northern Railway. Exhausting their bargaining power with the Interstate Commerce Commission, SCGX President Charles C. Flanley directed future lobbying efforts to unlocking barge navigation of the Missouri River. His initiative was stalled throughout the 1930s by the Great Depression and Dust Bowl. In 1938, a renewed thirteen year campaign led by Secretary William Henry Marriott finally opened commercial navigation of the Missouri River and helped establish the Missouri River Basin Project, which included development of the Gavins Point Dam. The alternate transportation succeeded in breaking the railroad's monopoly. By the 1970s, SCGX was among the largest exchanges in the world; transacting over 100 million bushels annually (valued at $1 billion as of 2018).\n", "output": "a", "category": "Answerability Classification 860.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it, i.e., the proper nouns in the passage.

Passage:After the fall of the Lovell family following their support of the Lancastrian cause during the Wars of the Roses, the castle was confiscated in 1461 and passed through several owners until bought by Sir Thomas Arundell of Lanherne in 1544. The Arundells were an ancient and prominent Cornish family, the principal branches of which were seated at the manors of Lanherne, Trerice, Tolverne and Menadarva in Cornwall. The family held several estates in Wiltshire. The castle was confiscated when Sir Thomas \u2014 a staunch Roman Catholic \u2014 was executed for treason in 1552, but in 1570 was bought back by his son, Sir Matthew Arundell, later a Sheriff and Custos Rotulorum of Dorset. The Arundells, led by Thomas Arundell, 1st Baron Arundell of Wardour, subsequently became known as some of the most active of the Catholic landowners in England at the time of the Reformation; thus they were naturally Royalists in the English Civil War. During that conflict, Thomas Arundell, 2nd Baron Arundell of Wardour, was away from home on the King's business and had asked his wife, Lady Blanche Arundell, aged 61, to defend the castle with a garrison of 25 trained fighting men. On 2 May 1643 Sir Edward Hungerford, with 1,300 men of the Parliamentarian Army, demanded admittance to search for Royalists. He was refused and laid siege, setting about the walls with guns and mines. After five days the castle was threatened with complete destruction. Lady Arundell agreed to surrender, and the castle was placed under the command of Colonel Edmund Ludlow. Lord Arundell had died of his wounds after the Battle of Stratton, and his son, Henry 3rd Lord Arundell, next laid siege to his own castle, blew up much of it and obliged the Parliamentary garrison to surrender in March 1644.\n", "output": "b", "category": "Answerability Classification 860.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it, i.e., the proper nouns in the passage.

Passage:The widespread use of the swan as a badge largely derives from the legend of the Swan Knight, today most familiar from Richard Wagner's opera Lohengrin. A group of Old French chansons de geste called the Crusade cycle had associated the legend with the ancestors of Godfrey of Bouillon (d. 1100), the hero of the First Crusade. Although Godfrey had no legitimate issue, his family had many descendants among the aristocracy of Europe, many of whom made use of the swan in their heraldry or as a para-heraldic emblem. In England these included the important de Bohun family, which used the so-called Bohun swan as its heraldic badge; after the marriage in 1380 of Mary de Bohun (d. 1394) to the future King Henry IV of England, the swan became adopted by the House of Lancaster, who continued to use it for over a century. The swan with the crown and chain is especially associated with Lancastrian use; it echoes the crown and chain of Richard II's white hart, which he began to use as a livery badge from 1390. As well as several of his own white hart badges, Richard's treasure roll of 1397 also includes a swan badge with a gold chain, perhaps presented by one of his enemies mentioned above: \"Item, a gold swan enamelled white with a little gold chain hanging around the neck, weighing 2 oz., value, 46s. 8d\".

Passage:Black & White is a non-fiction book written by Shiva Naipaul and published by Hamish Hamilton in the U.K. in 1980. It was published with the title Journey to Nowhere: A New World Tragedy in the U.S. The book is based on Naipaul's trip to Guyana in the aftermath of the Jonestown Massacre, and his subsequent trip to the United States, in which he explored links between the People's Temple and other groups and individuals. Naipaul attempted to connect Rev. Jim Jones, founder of the People's Temple, with disparate parts of California's counterculture, and Guyanese and other Third World governments and the revolutionary ideologies which supported them. Naipaul was highly critical of these and other movements, including black theology, the nascent New Age movement and EST, in as much as they helped, in his analysis, to create fertile ground for the People's Temple to flourish on the two continents.

Passage:McKellar twice served as President pro tempore of the United States Senate, commencing in 1945, the first to hold the position under the system that has prevailed since of reserving it for the most senior member of the majority party. When Harry Truman became president in April 1945, upon FDR's death, the vice presidency became vacant (the mechanism for filling intra-term vacancies had not yet been created by the 25th Amendment), and so McKellar became the permanent presiding officer of the United States Senate. Also, as the President pro tempore of the Senate had, prior to 1886, been second in the presidential line of succession, behind only the vice president, Truman viewed McKellar as the logical wartime replacement for himself, and asked McKellar to attend all Cabinet meetings. In 1947 Truman successfully lobbied Congress to pass a new Presidential Succession Act restoring both the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate to the succession ahead of the Cabinet secretaries. By the time the law came into effect, McKellar was no longer in the position of President pro tempore, because Republicans held the majority in the 80th Congress. Truman vetoed the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947 to restrict labor unions, which McKellar voted in favor of. As such Truman selected Alben Barkley of Kentucky as his running mate in the 1948 presidential election. When Democrats regained control as a result of the 1948 elections, McKellar again became President pro tempore. He was therefore second in line for the presidency (behind the Speaker of the House) from January 3, 1949 until January 20, 1949, when Alben Barkley took office as Vice President of the United States.\n", "output": "b", "category": "Answerability Classification 860.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it, i.e., the proper nouns in the passage.

Passage:The band originated from a surf rock-influenced garage rock group, the Sanctions, in 1965. The Sanctions, which included James Lowe (vocals, guitar), Mark Tulin (bass guitar), Ken Williams (lead guitar), and Michael \"Quint\" Weakley (drums), recorded 12 cover songs on an acetate disc on March 27, 1965, in a home studio owned by Russ Bottomley. For their next set of recordings on September 29, 1965, the group, then known as Jim and the Lords, was joined by keyboardist Dick Hargrave, who left shortly afterwards to pursue a career in graphic arts. The songs went unreleased until Heartbeat Productions distributed the 2000 album, Then Came The Electric Prunes, which was commended for its good sound quality, considering the circumstances in which it was recorded. Back to a quartet, the band, while rehearsing in a garage, met a real estate agent named Barbara Harris. Harris had connections in the music industry, and introduced the group to Dave Hassinger to record demos at Sky Hill Studios. Hassinger, who had been working as the resident sound engineer at RCA Studios, recently completed development for The Rolling Stones' album, Aftermath, and expressed a desire to produce a record. He suggested to the group that they change their name, and they considered a list of alternatives. According to Lowe, the name Electric Prunes started off as a joke, but he eventually convinced other band members, saying, \"It's the one thing everyone will remember. It's not attractive, and there's nothing sexy about it, but people won't forget it.\" As a result of the recordings, a single, featuring a cover of the Gypsy Trips' folk rock tune, \"Ain't It Hard\", and the Lowe-penned song, \"Little Olive\", was released in early 1966, but failed to chart.\n", "output": "b", "category": "Answerability Classification 860.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it, i.e., the proper nouns in the passage.

Azurite is naturally occurring in Sinai and the Eastern Desert of Egypt. It was reported by F. C. J. Spurrell (1895) in the following examples; a shell used as a pallet in a Fourth Dynasty (2613 to 2494 BCE) context in Meidum, a cloth over the face of a Fifth Dynasty (2494 to 2345 BCE) mummy also at Meidum and a number of Eighteenth Dynasty (1543\u20131292 BCE) wall paintings. Depending on the degree of fineness to which it was ground, and its basic content of copper carbonate, it gave a wide range of blues. It has been known as mountain blue or Armenian stone, in addition it was formerly known as Azurro Della Magna (from Italian). When mixed with oil it turns slightly green. When mixed with egg yolk it turns green-grey. It is also known by the names blue bice and blue verditer, though verditer usually refers to a pigment made by chemical process. Older examples of azurite pigment may show a more greenish tint due to weathering into malachite. Much azurite was mislabeled lapis lazuli, a term applied to many blue pigments. As chemical analysis of paintings from the Middle Ages improves, azurite is being recognized as a major source of the blues used by medieval painters. Lapis lazuli (the pigment ultramarine) was chiefly supplied from Afghanistan during the Middle Ages, whereas azurite was a common mineral in Europe at the time.

At the beginning of the season, many believed this to be the year Stoops and the Wildcats would reach their first college bowl game in a decade; a winning season was considered a must in order for Stoops to remain as Wildcats head coach. Under the direction of Stoops, Arizona scored 70 points in the season opener against the Idaho Vandals, falling just four points short of a school record for points scored in a game. They went on to soundly defeat Toledo, UCLA, Washington, and California, but lost close games to New Mexico and Stanford. They went on to defeat Washington State on the road to secure bowl eligibility at six wins, but lost to Oregon on the road after mounting a dramatic second-half come-from-behind rally, and to Oregon State in Tucson on a last-second field goal. The Wildcats' final game of the regular season was a 31\u201310 victory on December 6 in Tucson against Arizona State in the annual Territorial Cup rivalry game. With that win and a final regular season record of 7\u20135, Arizona accepted a bid from to the Las Vegas Bowl to face BYU. It was the Wildcats' first bowl appearance since the 1998 Holiday Bowl. Stoops' reputation in Tucson was mixed; while the Wildcats had a winning record and appeared in and won their first bowl game in ten years, many fans were divided during the season on whether he should be retained as head coach, as they expected Stoops to guide the team to an eight, nine or even ten-win season given the talent level and the offensive and defensive systems employed by the Wildcats (and with the overall talent level in the Pac-10 conference perceived to be not as strong as usual in 2008). While Stoops brought the Wildcat football program to a level of respectability which was lost during the era of John Mackovic, some fans were disappointed the program was not at the elite level of Stoops' former program Oklahoma or of perennial Pac-10 football power USC. However, Stoops was given strong votes of confidence by UA (later UNLV) athletic director Jim Livengood, by university president Dr. Robert Shelton, and by several prominent Arizona football boosters.\n", "output": "b", "category": "Answerability Classification 860.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it, i.e., the proper nouns in the passage.

Passage:Telford Shopping Centre is a indoor shopping centre in Telford, Shropshire, England. It is located in the geographical and economic centre of the new town, on land which was previously undeveloped. The trustees of the shopping centre are registered offshore for tax purposes. It is the largest shopping area in the ceremonial county of Shropshire, being located roughly equidistant between Shrewsbury and the West Midlands conurbation. With a floor area of 100,000 m\u00b2, the centre is one of the twenty five largest in the country, and has an average footfall of 300,000 per week, equating to 15 million per annum. The centre is located on a site, containing over 175 stores. The Centre's catchment population is over 3 million people. The term Telford Town Centre is often used to refer to the shopping centre alone, but the town centre also encompasses the town park and surrounding areas of central Telford. The centre's logo features The Iron Bridge, of nearby Ironbridge, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 2008 the centre was ranked as 14th best in the country by CACI.. 2019 was the completion of the \u00a355 million redevelopment of the centre which included new stores and moving existing stores into bigger premisise.

Passage:In the session's closing minutes, Carlin's Felipe Nasr was on a fast lap and closed up to Johnny Cecotto Jr.'s slow Trident car on the racing line while driving through the fourth corner and appeared to execute an sudden manoeuvre resulting in Nasr gesticulating to Cecotto. The stewards deemed Nasr at fault and he incurred a three-grid penalty. Hence, Marciello, Arthur Pic (Campos Racing) and Lancaster rounded out the top ten. Leal was the fastest driver not to have received a penalty who was unable to qualify in the top ten; his best time of 1 minute and 39.588 seconds was 0.723 seconds off Palmer's pace. He was followed by Cecotto and Negr\u00e3o in the next two spots. Rossi could not replicate his earlier form and could only muster a 15th place start. Kimiya Sato (Campos Racing) was 16th and was closely followed by Ren\u00e9 Binder (Arden International) and Daly.

Artem Markelov (Russian Time) started from the back of the grid after a spin on cold tyres. This was caused by him running over the turn one kerb.

Passage:Za\u00efre was soon translated into English by Aaron Hill as Zara: A Tragedy. Following its successful run at London's Drury Lane Theatre in 1736, Zara became the most frequently staged English adaptation of a Voltaire play. Famous English actresses who have played the title role include Susannah Maria Cibber, who made her stage debut in the 1736 Drury Lane production, Sarah Siddons, and Elizabeth Younge. The first known professional performance of the play in the American Colonies was in Philadelphia on 26 December 1768, performed by the Hallam Company using the Aaron Hill version. The company took the play to New York City in 1769 and after the end of the Revolutionary War sporadically revived it there and in Philadelphia. The first professional performances after the hostilities ended were given in Baltimore in April 1782 by the Thomas Wall Company. Although the professional theatres were closed during the War, the play proved popular with the British Army. General Burgoyne, himself a playwright, produced Zara with military actors in British-occupied Boston in 1775 and four times in occupied New York between 1780 and 1781.\n", "output": "b", "category": "Answerability Classification 860.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it, i.e., the proper nouns in the passage.

In Game 3, the Lakers raced to an easy 137\u2013104 victory as Magic Johnson dished out 21 assists. After the game, Larry Bird said his team played like \"sissies\" in an attempt to light a fire under his teammates. In Game 4, the Lakers had a five-point game lead with less than a minute to play, but made several execution errors as the Celtics tied the game and then came away with a 129\u2013125 victory in overtime. The game was also marked by Celtic forward Kevin McHale's takedown of Laker forward Kurt Rambis on a breakaway layup which triggered the physical aspect of the rivalry. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar would go after Larry Bird later on in the third quarter, and 1981 Finals MVP Cedric Maxwell further antagonized the Lakers by following a missed James Worthy free throw by crossing the lane with his hands around his own neck, symbolizing that Worthy was \"choking\" under pressure.

In Game 6, the Lakers evened the series with a 119\u2013108 victory. In the game, the Lakers answered the Celtics rough tactics when Worthy shoved Cedric Maxwell into a basket support. After the game, a Laker fan threw a beer at Celtics guard M.L.

In the game the Lakers rallied from a 14-point deficit to three points down with one minute remaining, when Maxwell knocked the ball away from Magic Johnson.

Passage:Most Deep Learning systems rely on training and verification data that is generated and/or annotated by humans. It has been argued in media philosophy that not only low-payed clickwork (e.g. on Amazon Mechanical Turk) is regularly deployed for this purpose, but also implicit forms of human microwork that are often not recognized as such. The philosopher Rainer M\u00fchlhoff distinguishes five types of \"machinic capture\" of human microwork to generate training data: (1) gamification (the embedding of annotation or computation tasks in the flow of a game), (2) \"trapping and tracking\" (e.g. CAPTCHAs for image recognition or click-tracking on Google search results pages), (3) exploitation of social motivations (e.g. tagging faces on Facebook to obtain labeled facial images), (4) information mining (e.g. by leveraging quantified-self devices such as activity trackers) and (5) clickwork. M\u00fchlhoff argues that in most commercial end-user applications of Deep Learning such as Facebook's face recognition system, the need for training data does not stop once an ANN is trained. Rather, there is a continued demand for human-generated verification data\u00a0to constantly calibrate and update the ANN. For this purpose Facebook introduced the feature that once a user is automatically recognized in an image, they receive a notification. They can choose whether of not they like to be publicly labeled on the image, or tell Facebook that it is not them in the picture. This user interface is a mechanism to generate \"a constant stream of\u00a0 verification data\" to further train the network in real-time. As M\u00fchlhoff argues, involvement of human users to generate training and verification data is so typical for most commercial end-user applications of Deep Learning that such systems may be referred to as \"human-aided artificial intelligence\". \u00a0\n", "output": "a", "category": "Answerability Classification 860.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with a context passage which has extra information available on certain terms mentioned in it, i.e., the proper nouns in the passage.
