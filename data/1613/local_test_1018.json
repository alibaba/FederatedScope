Came incredibly fast in the mail and was packaged very nicely. The paperwork that came with it concerning product description/instructions was written in laughably horrible english, barely even comprehendable.

It's a little larger then the standard dv6000 battery, so it does stick out a little bit making your laptop not sit flush against a table top (not a big issue.) The battery took a couple of hours to charge each time I charged it and got roughly 6 hours of full on gaming time with it. The issue I do have with this battery is I litearlly only got about 4 days out of it. 4th day I had it just shut down while I was using it. Won't start off the battery now and will not charge. I never once charged the laptop with it on, and I've always made sure to drain the battery before charging it to insure it keeps its maximum battery life. When the battery is in and AC cord is plugged in, Windows states it's charging but always remains at 24% life. I have tried several different AC power cords to charge it aswell to no effect. I really was hoping this battery would be fine despite the bad reviews I've read and that maybe people where just getting fluke batteries, but that doesn't seem to be the case.

Amount of force needed to press the keys is too high. This causes the user to pound the keys.<br /><br />2. Keyboard seems to miss double leters effectively. Probably caused by #1 above. >>>Notice that I left a letter out of 'letters' in the sentence before. That was not on purpose!<<< I hit 'l' two times, but only got one. Hapens al the time unless I POUND the double letters intentionally. And again, the missed leters here ('Hapens', 'al') are hapening naturally.<br /><br />3. The keyboard is very loud and clacky as another reviewer mentioned. Probably caused by #1 above. I sit near a person at work that uses this keyboard and it is LOUD. She said her fingers have gotten stronger since using this keyboard, probably because she has to pound the keys. I'm actually considering buying her another keyboard out of my own pocket... Here at home, as I type this, I'm two rooms away from my sleeping wife, and I'm actually wondering if my typing will wake her up.<br /><br />4. They keys are recessed in a flush enclosure that has a rigid rim around the base of the keys. If you accidentally hit the edge of the left shift key for example, you'll hit the rigid edge, which is at the same elevation, and miss the shift. This is the first such keyboard I've ever used with this design peculiarity. I now know why keyboard keys should be raised instead of recessed into a flush case.<br /><br />On a positive note, it looks good. So if you are going for looks only, this is the keyboard for you.", "output": "Negative Review", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 463.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an Amazon review, indicate whether it is a 'Positive Review' or 'Negative Review'.", "input": "Fixed my problem very quickly!", "output": "Positive Review", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 463.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an Amazon review, indicate whether it is a 'Positive Review' or 'Negative Review'.", "input": "Link below for the HD video on YouTube<br />http://youtu.be/Rj6M9E35Zec<br /><br />Pros/Cons<br />Unfortunately I could not get it to work, gave up and returned it.

The first one became corrupt within a month, but only after I had moved 3 years worth of my photography to it and saved family records dating back to the 1530s on it. Lost forever. Western Digital had me mail it in for data retrieval only to tell me later that it was impossible because of encryption that was military grade. They sent me a new one with no apology for the priceless records that I could never get back again.<br /><br />During the next year I used the new one to store any new photos I took. Then I was injured in a car accident and didn't take any for a year, but continued to store documents on my WDMP. After under 2 years that drive also became corrupted and I once again lost everything; this time that included every paper I wrote for school for 2 years.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product to anyone, not even an enemy. It will cause you heartache and grief and you will never be able to recover whatever is lost because of it. The company don't care for their customers at all. The sooner people learn to quit giving their money to such a dishonest company the sooner we can put them out of business and no longer have to worry about them.", "output": "Negative Review", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 463.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an Amazon review, indicate whether it is a 'Positive Review' or 'Negative Review'.", "input": "I was a bit worried thatt I would miss holding the book and feeling the paper, but actually I would rather read on the Kindle.", "output": "Positive Review", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 463.json"}, {"instruction": "Given an Amazon review, indicate whether it is a 'Positive Review' or 'Negative Review'.", "input": "Unfortunately, I bought this device before learning online that it is slow, poorly designed, and extremely expensive compared to ANY other product on the market.

(Always get the Best Buy extended warranty.) I am currently a month outside of the Best Buy warranty, but have 9 days to go on the Lyncsys warranty, which allows refunds and returns for up to 90 days. Except Linksys/Belkin won't honor it. I heard various explanations for this--they had to ask Best Buy and *they* said no, there isn't a warranty unless I bought it directly from Lyncsys/Belkin, all they can do is replace it. They are replacing the slow, poorly designed, and extremely expensive device with another slow, poorly designed, and extremely expensive device, and that is their response to my request that they actually do what they promised.<br />I've had probably 10 Lyncsys or Belkin products in the past, which all worked very well. I don't know why this one is an aberration, or if my customer service experience is an aberration. I will soon have a new, in-box Lyncsys WUSB6300, which I won't use, and a deeply dissatisfying and disheartening opinion of Lyncsys and Belkin as businesses, which I will use to guide my future purchases.", "output": "Negative Review", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 463.json"}]
