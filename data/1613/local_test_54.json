He  was brought on by  Steve Jobs  to be the then-young founder's \"adult supervision. \"\nSculley  started  his  career at Pepsi driving  its  trucks and eventually became  its  CEO.\n He  stayed at Apple for 10 years  and had a tense relationship with Jobs that led to  Jobs'  temporary departure from the company.\nAfter Apple   Sculley  became a tech investor and  he 's now a founding member of a healthcare startup that  he  thinks could one day generate even more revenue than Apple.\n John Sculley  remembers the first time  he  met  Steve Jobs .  He  was CEO of Pepsi at the time  and  he  flew to California to meet with the then-26-year-old cofounder of Apple about a potential CEO role there.\n Jobs  had met about 20 other candidates and been unimpressed. But after 5 months of getting to know  Sculley    he  was sold and offered  him  the job.  Sculley  initially turned  it  down. Then  Jobs  dropped a now-famous line on  him  that made  Sculley  change  his  mind:\n\"Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life? Or do you want to come with  me  and change the world?\"\n Sculley  spent a decade at Apple  and  it  was a roller coaster ride. So was  his  relationship with  Jobs . During one particularly tense moment   Jobs  planned a coup to unseat  Sculley . When  Sculley  learned about  Jobs'  plan   he  held a board meeting that resulted in Jobs running from the room crying and taking a long sabbatical. It's a moment  Sculley  now regrets.\n\"In hindsight  now that I have decades of perspective  I didn't appreciate how important founders are  \" Sculley  said in an interview for Business Insider's podcast  \"Success! How I Did It.\"\n\"This was not a power struggle; this was two different points of view of how do you make the company sustainable. I can't change it  that's history  but it's actually beautiful that  Steve  did eventually come back to Apple  and of course  he  ended up becoming a very successful CEO.  Steve Jobs 2.0  had matured tremendously from Steve Jobs 1.0.\"\nAfter  Sculley  left Apple   he  became a tech investor.  He 's now the cofounder of a healthcare startup that  he  thinks could become even bigger than Apple someday  RXAdvance.  He  says 5% of the US population \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the chronically ill \u00e2\u0080\u0094 accounts for $1.5 trillion in spending. And  he  thinks  he 's figured out a way to solve it.\n\"It turns out that the avoidable drug impacted medical costs \u00e2\u0080\u0094this is out of that $3 trillion of health spending \u00e2\u0080\u0094adds up to about $840 billion. That's many times bigger than most industries  certainly in high tech  and of that $840 billion  it's estimated that $350 billion is avoidable expense  \" Sculley  explained.\n Sculley  discussed  his  career   his  friendship and eventual falling out with  Steve Jobs   and  his  new healthcare initiative on the podcast  which you can listen to below.\n John Sculley : Thank you.\n Sculley : Oh  I wish you wouldn't bring that up! I was in Hawaii because  we  would introduce market by market  and fortunately those days  we  didn't have cable television so that you could see something that happened in Hawaii all the way back on the mainland.

Take away that holy trinity  and no Indian would agree to get out of bed to a country filled with poverty  partisan riots  and corruption. I was born and raised in New Delhi  and my family so besotted with movies that our modest flat boasted three televisions  which lowered the odds of World War III breaking out between those who chose the news broadcast over the 1955 black-and-white Devdas  or the primary colored Hindi musicals of the 1980s  or Wimbledon. Only one man could unite a family:  Hindi film actor Amitabh Bachchan . He's not a politician or a saint  even though there's a temple that prays for him in Calcutta. But he's family to practically everyone I consider family.\nFor someone so integral to India   Bachchan  struck out with  his  first nine films.  He  scored a major Indian film award for 1970's Anand  but it wasn't  his  breakout role. Depending on who you ask   Bachchan 's rise could be credited to 1972's action comedy Bombay to Goa  or the decade-defining Zanjeer in 1973. Objectively  the latter did spark the nexus of  Bachchan 's fame: the \"angry young man\" struggling daily in a country rife with despair and unemployment  who isn't afraid to fight back if necessary.\nIndia in the 70s was overflowing with young college graduate males who'd been told their dreams would come true in a country that was just turning 30. Instead  they stared down arch societal expectations. Around this time  there were also unwed mothers who'd been abandoned by the rotten male scoundrels in their life\u00e2\u0080\u0094young women repulsed by men leering at them on buses and in college corridors. There were dockworkers who dreamed of glamour and intrigue. Ordinary people everywhere wanted to be whisked away for three hours and 30 minutes.  Bachchan  was a handsome young man with  his  back to the wall in movies about surviving while staying true to faith and family; to millions   he  was life itself.\n Bachchan  plays Jai  a common yet wise criminal who  along with  his  partner Veeru  is recruited by an ex-cop who wishes revenge on a famous dacoit. I watched Sholay last week for the first time in almost a decade  and it was such a warm and welcome experience that I wanted to dance in the streets and send everyone to Hindi classes so they could understand the dialogue. Indeed  there are nuances in  Bachchan 's delivery that risk being lost in translation; in Sholay   his  voice moves like oiled leather  and  his  first line of dialogue translated is a hallmark of leftism: \"All cops look the same to  me .\"\nWhile recently revisiting  Bachchan 's filmography  two films took me by surprise. I hadn't seen Abhimaan from 1973 since I was a teenager and was wary to revisit it; based on the marital troubles of Pandit Ravi Shankar and his first wife  Annapurna Devi  it's an dissection of the jealousy that consumes a famous singer after his new bride turns out to be more talented than him. The film's honest depiction of sexual desire and gratification  and its death in the face of discord  took me by surprise  and that  Bachchan  plays the part of the disgruntled singer opposite his own wife  Jaya Bhaduri  adds layers to the film that I wouldn't have noticed as a child.\nOn the other hand  I've watched 1975's Chupke Chupke many times and have yet to tire of  Bachchan 's portrayal of Sukumar Sinha  an intelligent English literature professor who's hapless in playing an elaborate practical joke on his friend's brother-in-law.  Bachchan  has comedic potential that directors have often ignored in order to rack up the drama points; he's no less hilarious in Piku from 2015  in which he plays ornery Bengali father Bhashkor Banerjee  consumed by constipation and all discussions thereof.\nBhashkor lives with his adult daughter Piku (Deepika Padukone)  an architect who's nearing her last nerve while taking care of her father; for the first time  I saw myself in  Bachchan  in that I know what it is to be a stubborn Bengali daughter to a stubborn Bengali father. Water pooled in my eyes as I imagined future conversations about the color and consistency of stool with an ailing father\u00e2\u0080\u0094whether from mirth or sorrow  I wasn't sure.\nTruffaut called  Bachchan  a \"one-man industry\"; a nation full of disheartened unemployed youths called him \"the angry young man\"; mothers called him their son. As for my aunt  she didn't call him anything when she met him once  after a premiere in New Delhi. She was a teenager  and shook his hand. He smiled at her. That night  she slept with that hand cupped neatly against one cheek. I am certain that if I am lucky enough to meet him before he passes  I would do the same.", "output": "A Tribute to the Only Bollywood Star My Indian Family Ever Agreed About", "category": "Title Generation 1046.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, generate a short title of the document.

(Photo: JUAN CARLO/THE STAR)\nThat's according to a preliminary report recently released by the state agency. It details the chain of events from Dec. 14  when  Cory Iverson   32  died in the blaze. The report also lists safety issues for review.\n Iverson  who had worked for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) since 2009   had responded to help battle the Ventura County blaze as part of a fire engine strike team out of the agency's San Diego unit.\nThe fire  which has now burned 440 square miles in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties  has not yet been fully contained. Two people  a woman evacuating the fire and  Iverson   died and 1 063 structures were destroyed.\nFour firefighters were able to retreat up an escape route and were uninjured  the preliminary report says.  Iverson   however  became trapped while trying to put out the flames and was killed.\nThis undated photo provided by Cal Fire shows Fire Apparatus Engineer Corey  Iverson   right  with his wife  Ashley  and their daughter.  Iverson   who worked for the department's San Diego Unit as a member of a fire strike team  died while fighting the Thomas Fire north of Fillmore. (Photo: VIA AP)\nAutopsy results showed  he  died from burns and smoke inhalation. No other injuries were reported.\nThe steep terrain  heavy vegetation and hazardous weather conditions such as erratic winds and low humidity \u00e2\u0080\u0094 all which were present when  Iverson  died \u00e2\u0080\u0094 contribute to that extreme fire behavior  the report states.\nBefore  Iverson  and the team began their 24-hour shift two safety briefings were held  according to the report.\nThe crew was in the second half of their shift when  Iverson  became trapped. They worked from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Dec. 13 mopping up flames that had gone over a fire line on a ridge southwest of an avocado orchard  the report states.\nWhen  Iverson  and the four other firefighters in  his  strike team began working that day fire intensity was described as low and the upslope wind was pushing the smoke toward the west.\nThey each carried 300 feet of hose.  Iverson  also carried a scraping tool. As they started  the fire backed up to the dozer line  the report says.\nAs they worked  spot fires flared up. One started burning in front of  Iverson   and as  he  worked to put it out with a tool  a second one was reported nearby.\n Iverson  dropped some of the hose from  his  pack and went to put out the second spot fire. When  he  got there  it erupted.\nWith spot fires growing fast  firefighters' hoses did little to quell the flames.  Iverson  called in a request for air support. That was  his  last confirmed radio transmission  the report says.", "output": "Calif. report: Engineer trapped by flames before death in Thomas fire", "category": "Title Generation 1046.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, generate a short title of the document.

Al Franken told Democratic leaders gathered on the eve of a hotly contested governor's election in Virginia. After an expectant pause  he leaned into the microphone and added  \"Ignore them.\"\n Franken  was jokingly beseeching activists to get out the vote the following day  in what ended up as a surprisingly decisive victory for Democratic candidate Ralph Northam. But the moment  barely two weeks ago  also underscored how high the one-time \"Saturday Night Live\" comic had risen in  his  party's firmament.\nAfter spending much of  his  nearly nine years as senator trying to shed  his  funnyman image and quietly digging into issues like internet access and consumer protection   he  was now a draw at political events and mentioned by some as a 2020 presidential possibility. Months of savaging some of President Donald Trump's appointees had turned the Harvard-educated Franken into a weapon of choice for Democrats eager to attack the administration and energize party voters.  He  brandished comedy as a bludgeon.\nNow   Franken 's rising trajectory has been interrupted by allegations  he  had physical contact with four women without their permission.  He  faces a Senate ethics investigation for improper conduct and hasn't been seen publicly since the first claims of misbehavior last week.  His  future is suddenly unclear.\n\"It's always a great disappointment when leaders you like and admire do bad stuff \" said Mike Lux  a liberal Democratic consultant. He said it was premature to say how the allegations would affect  Franken 's career. But  Lux added  \"If more incidents come to light   he 's got a real problem.\"\nLos Angeles radio anchor Leeann Tweeden last week said  Franken  had put  his  tongue in her mouth during a 2006 USO tour  before  he  became senator. She also posted a photo of  him  with  his  hands above her chest as she slept wearing a flak vest aboard a military plane. Franken  66  has apologized.\nIn a story published Wednesday by the Huffington Post  two more women alleged that  Franken  touched their buttocks during campaign events in 2007 and 2008.\n Franken  canceled a sold-out appearance in Atlanta to promote  his  book  \"Al Franken  Giant of the Senate.\"  His  aides have said  he 's \"spending time with  his  family and doing a lot of reflecting.\"\nFILE - In this May 3  2017  file photo   Senate Judiciary Committee member Sen.

That rising trajectory has been interrupted by allegations that  he  forcibly kissed one woman and squeezed another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s buttocks without their permission. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster  File)\n Franken  came to the Senate after a months-long recount gave  him  a 312-vote victory in  his  2008 election.  He  immediately distanced  himself  from  his  decades of professional comedy  which included off-color jokes about rape and disparaging women  and avoided national reporters.\nInstead   he  focused on building a reputation as a studious senator  pushing legislation to crack down on Wall Street rating agencies  he  considered complicit in the 2007 economic collapse. As a signature issue   he  adopted the push to protect \"net neutrality \" an Obama administration policy barring internet providers from blocking or hindering websites. The Trump administration's Federal Communications Commission said Tuesday it will dismantle the rule.\n Franken  helped shape parts of former President Barack Obama's health care law and tackled farm and mental health issues.  He  easily secured a second six-year term in 2014  defeating a Republican businessman.\n Franken  appeared on  his  first Sunday network talk show late in  his  first term amid signs  he  was bolstering  his  national profile. But it was Trump's emergence that teased out a new  Franken  and had  him  pivot from staid senator to liberal attack dog.\nIn withering interrogations in the Senate   Franken  has clashed with a parade of Trump Cabinet appointees.\n\" He  made those guys sweat \" former Senate Democratic aide Jim Manley said. \" He 's got the ability to channel some of the populist rage against the administration.\"\n Franken  had a celebrated clash last month with Jeff Sessions over the attorney general's evolving descriptions of  his  contacts with Russian officials during last year's presidential campaign. Sessions  a Trump campaign official  told Congress in January  he 'd not communicated with the Russians.  He  later said  he  didn't recall such contact.

But  problematically  \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t plan ahead as the internet matured \u00e2\u0080\u009d when consumers of information were left to contend with not only \u00e2\u0080\u009chuman arbiters of facts\u00e2\u0080\u009d but also code and algorithms that propel certain types of content to the fore  based on our own online behavior. Innocently sharing a cat video put out by Russia Today  a Kremlin-backed propaganda machine that elevates fringe \u00e2\u0080\u009cexperts\u00e2\u0080\u009d and attempts to sow distrust  means you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see a lot more of their content in the future.\nComplicating matters more is that in our politicized climate  the term fake news itself came to mean different things to different people. It had a literal meaning that  seemingly overnight  became a hashtag and an epithet to hurl at anything or anyone that one disagrees with. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even come to some kind of convergence and talk about something as insidious and as threatening to our future as the spread of misinformation\u00e2\u0080\u0094otherwise known as fake news in the literal sense\u00e2\u0080\u0094then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we have sort of a catastrophically huge problem on our hands?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asks  Webb .\nAs someone who studies current and past trends to try to anticipate what the future may hold   Webb  likes to end these conversations with a reminder that  for however doomed things appear  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are not living in the middle of Westworld\u00e2\u0080\u0094the future has not been preordained. There is something we can do in the year 2018 and beyond  and that is be smarter consumers of news.\u00e2\u0080\u009d", "output": "Can American Society Overcome the Fake News Phenomenon? \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Mother Jones", "category": "Title Generation 1046.json"}]
