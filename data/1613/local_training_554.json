Over time, the constant pressure of blood moving through a weakened artery can cause a section of its wall to enlarge and form a bulge (aneurysm). The damage can build over time. The excess strain and resulting damage from high blood pressure (HBP or hypertension) causes the coronary arteries serving the heart to slowly become narrowed from a buildup of fat, cholesterol and other substances that together are called plaque. This slow process is known as atherosclerosis. High blood pressure with a known cause is called secondary hypertension. Between 5% and 15% of people with high blood pressure have secondary hypertension. In many of these people, high blood pressure results from a kidney disorder.

It takes additional heat to raise the temperature of the water to reach its boiling point. This is about 180 BTUs for 1 pound of water. To change the liquid state into water vapor, it requires an additional 972 BTUs per pound of water. By changing state twice; that is, ice to water to vapor, approximately 1,300 BTUs of heat energy per pound of water has been stored in the moisture which is bound to the air. Any time condensation and freezing occurs, that amount of heat energy will be released, thus raising the temperature of the air. Best Answer: Water vapor is the dominant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Water vapor high in the atmosphere can produce 'noctiluminescent' clouds, primarily from the space shuttle exhaust. At ground level it makes things humid and unpleasant, though it does prevent plant dessication. Dew and fog can be an important source of moisture in some environments. A broad question. Greenhouse gas. A greenhouse gas (abbrev. GHG) is a gas in an atmosphere that absorbs and emits radiation within the thermal infrared range. This process is the fundamental cause of the greenhouse effect. The primary greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere are water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Changes in water vapor and clouds are amplifying global warming A new paper represents a major step in measuring and understanding the Earth\u2019s climate John Abraham Overview of Greenhouse Gases. : 1  Carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere through burning fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, and oil), solid waste, trees and wood products, and also as a result of certain chemical reactions (e.g., manufacture of cement). The increased water vapor in turn leads to an increase in the greenhouse effect and thus a further increase in temperature; the increase in temperature leads to still further increase in atmospheric water vapor; and the feedback cycle continues until equilibrium is reached. Water Vapor Confirmed As Major Player In Climate Change Date: November 18, 2008 Source: NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center Summary: Water vapor is known to be Earth's most abundant greenhouse gas, but the extent of its contribution to global warming has been debated. Using recent NASA satellite data, researchers have estimated more precisely than ever the heat-trapping effect of water in the air, validating the role of the gas as a critical component of climate change. Scientists will discuss the role of water vapor, the most abundant greenhouse gas, at a conference sponsored by the American Geophysical Union in Potomac, Maryland, October 12-15. Despite the fact that the water vapour concentration of the atmosphere is 5 times that of CO2 (around 0.3% by mass for water vapour cf around 0.06% by mass for CO2), the contribution of CO2 to the greenhouse effect is at least 10% (and more like 25-30% with the water vapour feedback). Magma contains dissolved gases, which provide the driving force that causes most volcanic eruptions. As magma rises towards the surface and pressure decreases, gases are released from the liquid portion of the magma (melt) and continue to travel upward and are eventually released into the atmosphere.", "output": "effect of water vapor on the environment", "category": "Question Generation 1497.json"}, {"instruction": "Write a phrase, the answer to which is present in the passage.

Failure to do this could result in a destructive feedback loop that would contribute to the deg-radation of the reef and, ultimately, Belize\u2019s diminished competitiveness in the ecotourism market. Keywords Tourism \u00b7 Belize \u00b7 Conservation awareness \u00b7 Coral bleaching, if it continues, will threaten coral reefs around the world whenever the weather conditions are unusually hot, and will affect not only reefs that are under stress by human usage but also the most remote and pristine reefs so far untouched by human hands. This is a recipe for disaster for any and all reefs. Growth for a reef occurs slowly. Typically reefs can generate approx one inch of growth per year. Any interruption to this slow growth only weakens the coral and severely limits it\u2019s ability to cope with environmental change.. For example, anchor damage on a reef in the Virgin Islands resulted in a decrease in live coral cover, compared to coral cover on adjacent undamaged reefs which remained ten years after the damage occurred. ref Anchoring also damages reef-associated habitats such as seagrasses, which provide important nursery and juvenile habitats for many coral reef species. Coral Reefs and the Unintended Impact of Tourism The choices we make as tourists can affect the health of Costa Rica\u2019s renowned coral reefs. By Guest Blogger | April 18, 2016 tourism can have negative impacts on coral reefs including pollution, direct contact of tourists, anchor damage, and sedimentation from coastal erosion and over-development. However, tourism can also create positive shifts toward conservation of coral reefs.

Shark Ecotourism and the Effects on Coral Reef Ecosystems Research Question: Does shark based ecotourism have impacts, either good or bad, on the health and sustainability of nearby coastal ecosystems? To measure the effects of food provisioning on the ecosystem I will take five water samples at each site, The Coral Reef Alliance, based in San Francisco, lists several things people can do to help protect coral reefs: choosing sustainably-harvested seafood and not buying coral jewellery are a few. But using biodegradable sunscreen isn\u2019t one of them. Time and again we hear arguments in favor of ecotourism, only to then discover cases where human visitation to wilderness sites has negative impacts, both on individual species and entire ecosystems.", "output": "ecotourism effects on coral reef", "category": "Question Generation 1497.json"}, {"instruction": "Write a phrase, the answer to which is present in the passage.

Faults A break in the Earth's lithosphere where one block of rock moves toward, away from, or past another. That result suggests a powerful feedback between the forces that make the topography and the 'push-back' on the system exerted by the topography, they explained. While their model cannot accurately predict when and where earthquakes will occur in the short-term, it can help at better understanding or forecasting earthquakes over longer time spans, Dr. Holt said. The record of an earthquake, a seismogram, as recorded by a seismometer, will be a plot of vibrations versus time. On the seismograph, time is marked at regular intervals, so that we can determine the time of arrival of the first P-wave and the time of arrival of the first S-wave. \u2022 Surface waves are produced when earthquake energy reaches the surface of Earth. 2 Features of Earthquakes \u2022 Surface waves travel outward from the epicenter. \u2022 The earthquake epicenter (EH pih sen tur) is the point on Earth\u2019s surface directly above the earthquake focus.

These areas are plate boundaries, boundaries, generally in the middle of oceans or along the edges of a. Deep earthquakes occur along where a denser oceanic plate subducts into the mantle. b. A strong burst of shaking occurs during an earthquake. The second longest ever recorded earthquake occurred in 1964 in Alaska and lasted for four minutes (Figure 9.9). Foreshocks are small bursts of shaking that may precede a large earthquake. Foreshocks can occur days before the earthquake hits, or just minutes before. strongly related to lithospheric plate boundaries.

Sunlight is the perfect balance of wavelengths necessary for plant growth and blooming, but you can also use artificial light to help your plants along. In fact, low-light foliage plants (such as pothos and peace lily) can grow quite nicely in windowless offices with enough artificial light. In order to grow, plants need: 1  Blue wavelength light for foliage growth. 2  Red wavelength light for flowering and fruiting. 3  Plants have little use for green wavelengths and reflect them back, which is why leaves appear green.
