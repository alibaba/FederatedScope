Together, they formed the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), which was formed for service in France and became known as the Old Contemptibles. The' second' army was Kitchener's Army, formed from the volunteers in 1914 -- 1915 destined to go into action at the Battle of the Somme. The' third' was formed after the introduction of conscription in January 1916, and by the end of 1918, the British Army had reached its maximum strength of 3,820,000 men and could field over 70 divisions. The vast majority of the British Army fought in the main theatre of war on the Western Front in France and Belgium against the German Empire. Some units were engaged in Italy and Salonika against Austria-Hungary and the Bulgarian Army, while other units fought in the Middle East, Africa and Mesopotamia -- mainly against the Ottoman Empire -- and one battalion fought alongside the Japanese Army in China during the Siege of Tsingtao.'.

The elements in a group have similar physical or chemical characteristics of the outermost electron shells of their atoms (i.e., the same core charge), as most chemical properties are dominated by the orbital location of the outermost electron. There are three systems of group numbering. The modern numbering group 1 to group 18 is recommended by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). It replaces two older naming schemes that were mutually confusing. Also, groups may be identified by their topmost element or have a specific name.
