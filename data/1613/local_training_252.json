Owner desires to retain the services of Service Provider to operate and manage the SEF and provide scheduled maintenance of the SEF, and  Service Provider is willing to perform such services upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.\n\nAGREEMENT\n\nIn consideration of the foregoing recitals, the mutual agreements, representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this Agreement and the  Exhibits hereto, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, Owner and Service Provider agree as  follows:\n\nARTICLE 1.  RESPONSIBILITIES OF SERVICE PROVIDER\n\n1.1 Appointment of Service Provider.\n\n(a) Owner hereby appoints Service Provider, and Service Provider hereby accepts the appointment, to perform the SEF operations and maintenance  services (Services) on behalf of Owner as of the Services Commencement Date as further described in Exhibit C hereto in accordance with and  subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.\n\n(b) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, Service Provider shall perform the Services and its obligations under this  Agreement, and act at all times as an independent Service Provider of Owner. None of Service Provider's employees shall be, or shall be  considered to be, employees of Owner. Service Provider shall be fully responsible for the payment of all wages, salaries, benefits and other  compensation to its employees. This Agreement is not intended to create, and shall not be construed to create, and neither Party shall be or  constitute, or be deemed or construed to be or constitute, under any circumstances or for any purpose whatsoever, a partner, joint venturer, agent  (except as specifically provided in this Agreement) or legal representative of the other Party, and the Parties expressly disclaim any intention to  create a partnership, joint venture, association or other such relationship. Neither Party is granted any right or authority to assume or create any  obligation or responsibility, express or implied, on behalf of or in the name of the other Party, or to bind the other Party in any manner (except as  specifically provided in this Agreement).\n\n1.2 Performance of Maintenance Services.

The Party receiving such documents or information shall not  publish or otherwise disclose them or use them for its own purposes (otherwise than as may be required by it, its professional advisers, or  potential or actual lenders or investors, or potential or actual subcontractors to perform its obligations or to assert its rights under this  Agreement). Each Party further agrees, to the extent requested by the supplier of such information, to require its subcontractors, vendors,  suppliers and employees to enter into appropriate nondisclosure agreements relative to such confidential information, prior to the receipt thereof.  To the extent reasonably required, confidential information may be made available to potential debt and equity investors and as necessary subject  to a mutually acceptable confidentiality agreement or to respective advisors who are bound to confidentiality by applicable rules of professional  conduct or by mutually acceptable confidentiality agreements. The provisions of this Section 7.1 shall not apply to information within any one of  the following categories or any combination thereof: (1) information that was in the public domain prior to the receiving Party's receipt or that  subsequently becomes part of the public domain by publication or otherwise, except by the receiving party's wrongful act; (2) information that the  receiving Party can demonstrate was in its possession prior to receipt thereof from the disclosing Party and not otherwise subject to an obligation  of confidentiality; or (3) information received by a Party from a third party having no obligation of secrecy with respect thereof.\n\n(b) The obligations of the Parties under this Section will survive for a period of two (2) years from and after the expiration or termination of the  Agreement.\n\nARTICLE 8.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, Service Provider shall indemnify, defend  and hold harmless Owner and Owner's officers, directors, employees and agents from and against all claims, losses, damages, liabilities and  expenses, including attorneys' fees and expenses, arising out of or resulting from those Hazardous Conditions introduced to the Premises by  Service Provider or anyone for whose acts it may be liable.\n\n10.2 Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of California, without\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngiving effect to the conflicts of laws principles thereof.

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, any amendment, modification or change to this Agreement will be void unless in  writing and executed by both Parties.\n\n10.4 Non-Waiver. No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right, power, privilege, or remedy hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof.  No waiver by either Party of a breach of any term or provision contained herein shall be effective unless signed and in writing and signed by the  waiving party. No consent by either Party to, or waiver of, a breach by either Party, whether express or implied, shall be construed, operate as, or  constitute a consent to, waiver of, or excuse of any other or subsequent or succeeding breach by either Party.\n\n10.5 Severability. If any part, term, or provision of this Agreement is determined by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,  illegal, or unenforceable, such determination shall not affect or impair the validity, legality, or enforceability of any other part, term, or provision of  this Agreement, and shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole. Rather the part of this Agreement that is found invalid or  unenforceable will be amended, changed, or interpreted to achieve as nearly as possible the same objectives and economic effect as the original  provision, or replaced to the extent possible, with a legal, enforceable, and valid provision that is as similar in tenor to the stricken provision, within  the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions, and the remainder of this Agreement will remain in full force\n\n10.6 No Third Party Beneficiary. Nothing in this Agreement will provide any benefit to any third party or entitle any third party to any claim, cause  of action, remedy or right of any kind.\n\n10.7 No Recourse to Affiliates. This Agreement is solely and exclusively between the Parties, and any obligations created herein on the part of  either Party shall be the obligations solely of such Party. No Party shall have recourse to any parent, subsidiary, partner, member, affiliate, lender,  director, officer or employee of the other Party for performance or non-performance of any obligation hereunder, unless such obligations were  assumed in writing by the Person against whom recourse is sought.\n\n10.8 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, and in original or portable document format, and by the  different parties hereto on the same or separate counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original instrument, and all of which together  shall constitute one and the same Agreement.\n\n10.9 Further Assurances. The Parties shall at their own cost and expense do such further acts, perform such further actions, execute and deliver  such further or additional documents and instruments as may be reasonably required or appropriate to consummate, evidence, or confirm the  agreements and understandings contained herein and to carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreement.\n\n10.10 General Interpretation. The terms of this Agreement have been negotiated by the Parties hereto and the language used in this Agreement  shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the Parties hereto to express their mutual intent. This Agreement shall be construed without regard  to any presumption or rule requiring construction against the Party causing such instrument of any portion thereof to be drafted, or in favor of the  Party receiving a particular benefit under this Agreement. No rule of strict construction will be applied against any person.\n\n10.11 Access to Premises. Owner shall furnish reasonable access to the Premises in order to allow Service Provider to perform the Services.

Owner  shall coordinate and provide for User's, or User's agent's, supervision of Service Provider, as may be required by User, in a manner that shall not  disrupt Service Provider's performance of the Services.\n\n10.12 No Claims against the Premises. Service Provider understands and acknowledges that the SEF is separate from, and not an improvement to or  a part of the Premises and that the SEF is separately owned by Owner. Owner, and not User, any owner, landlord, tenant, or subtenant of the  Premises, is solely responsible for the payment of all Services Fees, and Service Providers shall have no claim against the Premises for unpaid  Services Fees. Service Provider agrees not to attempt to record any lien against the Premises for unpaid Services Fees.\n\n10.13 Headings. The headings of the Sections of this Agreement are inserted for convenience of reference only and do not form a part or affect the  meaning hereof.\n\n10.14 Public Announcements.

To the extent consistent with applicable law, the Public Party shall have given the other Party,  Owner, or User advance notice and an opportunity to review and provide comment on such releases. On the Public Party's request, the other Party  shall provide a written description of information about such Party as it should appear in such filings.\n\n10.15 Force Majeure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Party shall be liable for any failure to comply  with its obligations under the this Agreement, other than to pay moneys due, to the extent arising out of any circumstances not within the  reasonable control, directly or indirectly, of the Party affected (Force Majeure). Force Majeure shall include fire, explosion, flood, earthquake,  hurricane, tornado, storm, wind or other unusually adverse weather, civil commotions, civil disobedience, war, rebellion, sabotage, acts of civil or  military authority, acts of public enemy, acts of terrorism, boycotts, industry-wide strike or labor difficulties, acts of God, and any actions or  inactions by the local utility, but shall not include any inability to make payments that are due hereunder. Each Party shall be entitled to an  equitable adjustment for its performance obligations hereunder arising from Force Majeure. A Party claiming Force Majeure shall promptly notify  the other party, specifying in reasonable detail the event of Force Majeure, the expected duration, and the steps such party is taking to remedy any  delay.\n\n[SIGNATURE PAGE FOLLOWS]\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperations and Maintenance Agreement Aerojet 1\n\nINTENDING TO BE LEGALLY BOUND, Owner and Service Provider have signed this Agreement through their duly authorized representatives  effective as of the latest date set forth below.\n\nOWNER:\n\nDate: December 11, 2009\n\nSOLAR TAX PARTNERS 1, LLC\n\nBy: /s/ HEK Partners, LLC by William Hedden and Steven Kay\n\nPrinted name: William Hedden and Steven Kay\n\nTitle: Members\n\nAddress:\n\n1838 15th Street\n\nSan Francisco, CA\n\nSERVICE PROVIDER:\n\nDate: December 11, 2009\n\nSOLAR POWER, INC.\n\nBy: /s/ Todd Lindstrom\n\nPrinted name: Todd Lindstrom\n\nTitle: Executive Vice President\n\nTelephone: ( 916 ) 745-0900\n\nAddress:\n\n1115 Orlando Drive  Roseville, CA 95661\n\nTelephone: (916) 745-0900  Telefax: (916) 721-0428\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpertations and Maintenance Agreement Aerojet 1\n\nEXHIBIT A\n\nSEF DESCRIPTION\n\n3.6 MW SYSTEM\n\n(17,632) SPI SP205 MODULES\n\n(6) (AE 500KW) INVERTERS\n\n(3) 480V-12.7 KV TRANSFORMERS\n\nSEF IS A SINGLE AXIS CONERGY TRACKER SYSTEM\n\nExhibit A-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperations and Maintenance Agreement Aerojet 1\n\nEXHIBIT B\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PREMISES\n\nAEROJET \u2014 PHASE 1\n\nRANCHO CORDOVA, CA\n\nExhibit B-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperations and Maintenance Agreement Aerojet 1\n\nEXHIBIT C\n\nSCOPE OF SERVICES\n\nAs of the Delivery Date (as defined in the EPC) (Services Commencement Date), Service Provider shall provide the Services marked below as  frequently as indicated below in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement:\n\nMAINTENANCE SERVICE SCHEDULE\n\nExhibit C-1\n\n          SERVICES         INCLUDED         (ONLY IF         CHECKED)   SERVICE DESCRIPTION   SERVICE FREQUENCY \u00fe\n\n\n\nINSPECTION OF SEF'S GENERAL SITE CONDITIONS, PV ARRAYS, ELECTRICAL  EQUIPMENT, MOUNTING STRUCTURE, DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEM, AND  BALANCE OF SYSTEM PROVIDED UNDER EPC.\n\nBI-ANNUALLY (TBD)\n\n          \u00fe     SYSTEM TESTING, INCLUDING STRING LEVEL OPEN CIRCUIT VOLTAGE AND DC  OPERATING AMPERAGE TESTS.

APPOINTMENT AND SCOPE OF AUTHORITY\n\n1.1 The parties hereby agree that the Terminated Agreement shall terminate and cease to have effect for all purposes, and shall simultaneously be replaced by this Agreement, with effect from 25 September 2018 (the Effective Date).

The terms of the marketing program will be set forth in a marketing agreement between AGI and the Company. The marketing agreement will provide, among other things, the terms pursuant to which the Company shall make Fulfillment Deposits for warranty products sold as a part of the marketing program.\n\n        6. Relationship.

University recognizes that ArTara may receive specific data requests from Regulatory Authorities in connection with ArTara's presentations of Program Data to support Regulatory Filings. University will assist ArTara in responding to such requests for data or access to source data from Regulatory Authorities. ArTara agrees to notify University of such requests as soon as is practicable. The goal of Phase III will be filing of a BLA based on Project Documentation and response to Regulatory Authorities.\n\n4\n\nSource: ARTARA THERAPEUTICS, INC., 8-K, 1/10/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Phase IV Optional: Upon mutual written agreement of University and ArTara, ArTara may sponsor, and University may conduct, new Product or Product-related clinical studies (for example, follow-up studies) to support the goal of the Project or as may be useful for gaining or maintaining Regulatory Approvals for the Product for the Indication.

Billie and Craig Talesman, having an office located at 1800 Frank Huff Road, Seminole Reservation, Okeechobee, FL 34974, hereinafter referred to as SIC.\n\nOverview\n\nThe purpose and intent of this strategic alliance is to combine the resources and talents of, TKCI and SIC, in order to take advantage of every opportunity permitted by tribal sovereignty to create revenue streams in multiple areas in conjunction with operating partners that have existing marketing and customers in place, thereby limiting the capital requirements and risk. New marketing advantages based upon competitive pricing, cross marketing and new revenue streams from expansion into other industries will grow the business beyond anything previously imagined. The structure may also be used for additional compatible acquisitions which will also fuel growth. TKCI believes that structuring operations with Tribal Sovereignty will deliver the financial advantages of operating in a tax free environment with limited liability, plus other benefits such as permit and zoning ease, supporting an ideal structure for investment capital and successful entrepreneurial ventures.\n\nTerm\n\nThe term of this Agreement is twenty-four (24) months. The Agreement may be renewed, subject to mutual written approval.\n\nNotwithstanding the completion, expiration or termination of this Agreement, the indemnities warranties and undertakings contained or referred to in this Agreement shall continue to subsist for as long as may be necessary for the purpose of giving effect to each one and every one of them.\n\nTKCI Committments\n\nTKCI shall establish a wholly-owned subsidiary (the Holding Company) for the sole purpose of conducting and developing business on behalf of this alliance.

Turnkey Capital Inc. (TKCI) will reserve ten percent (10%) of the shares of TKCI for SIC. These shares will be issued once an exclusivity agreement is reached.

Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, Bellicum specifically agrees not to, and agrees not to cause any Third Party to, sell, market, export, transfer, or re-export Miltenyi Products without Miltenyi's express prior written consent.\n\n(e) Bellicum may offer and permit its Licensees and Subcontractors (if any) to use the Miltenyi Products supplied hereunder only if and so long as such use is in compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and Applicable Laws. Bellicum shall instruct and oblige its Licensees and Subcontractors accordingly.\n\n(f) Bellicum acknowledges that the Miltenyi Products should be used with the same caution applied to any potentially hazardous compound. Use of the Miltenyi Products by Bellicum, its Licensees or Subcontractors shall be supervised by a technically qualified individual.\n\n(g) Without limitation to the generality of clauses (a) through (e) above, Bellicum further will not, and will cause its Licensees and Subcontractors not to, without express prior written consent from Miltenyi:\n\n(1) Modify or alter, or cause any Third Party to modify or alter, any Miltenyi Product supplied hereunder other than in connection with its Permitted Use;\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\n(2) Reverse engineer, disassemble or otherwise analyze, or cause any Third Party to reverse engineer, disassemble or otherwise analyze, any Miltenyi Product supplied hereunder, in whole or in part; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right or ability of Bellicum or its Licensees or Subcontractors to identify defects, troubleshoot problems, evaluate, test, use or conduct any study utilizing any Miltenyi Product(s) as reasonably necessary to achieve the purposes of this Agreement;\n\n(3) Transfer any Miltenyi Product supplied hereunder to any Third Party, except to Bellicum Subcontractors or Licensees solely for the Permitted Use or for training or validation purposes in connection with Bellicum's development and commercialization of Bellicum Product;\n\n(4) Resell Miltenyi Product supplied hereunder to any Third Party, including Bellicum Subcontractors and Licensees, without prior express written permission from Miltenyi; or\n\n(5) Transfer, use, import or export any Miltenyi Product supplied to Bellicum hereunder in any country or territory other than the Designated Countries.\n\n2.3 Additional Countries. Miltenyi acknowledges that Bellicum and/or its Licensees may from time to time desire to use Miltenyi Products in one or more countries that are currently not part of the Designated Countries (each, an Additional Country). The Parties agree, upon reasonable written request by Bellicum from time to time during the term of this Agreement, to evaluate the regulatory requirements for utilizing of Miltenyi Products for manufacture of Bellicum Products in the requested Additional Country(ies). Based on the assessment of potentially required additional work (Additional Work), including but not limited to regulatory work pursuant to Section 4.9 as may be required to prepare and file Master Files for Miltenyi Products in support of Bellicum Product filings in such Additional Country(ies), the Parties will negotiate in good faith with the goal of entering into an agreement on mutually acceptable terms with respect to Miltenyi's provision of such Additional Work. Bellicum shall inform Miltenyi in writing at least twelve (12) months in advance prior to any intended regulatory filing in an Additional Country.\n\n2.4 Reserved Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing herein is intended nor shall be construed as creating any exclusive arrangement between Miltenyi and Bellicum with respect to the supply, purchase and/or use of the Miltenyi Products. Miltenyi reserves the right, at its sole discretion and without any restriction or limitation whatsoever, to manufacture, have manufactured, use, have used, sell, have sold, offer for sale, export, import or otherwise commercialize or dispose of Miltenyi Products in any manner and for any purpose whatsoever.\n\n2.5 Subcontracting by Miltenyi. Subject to the terms of the Quality Agreement, if applicable, Miltenyi may, at its sole discretion, upon reasonable prior written notice to Bellicum, elect to have the Miltenyi Products, or any one of them or any component thereof, manufactured by an Affiliate of Miltenyi, and further may subcontract the manufacturing of Miltenyi Product or any component thereof, to a Subcontractor; provided that (i) Miltenyi shall reasonably take into account Bellicum's written concerns regarding proposed Affiliate(s) or Subcontractor(s); and (ii) Miltenyi shall be solely and fully responsible for the performance of all delegated and subcontracted activities by its Affiliates and Subcontractor(s), including compliance with the terms of this Agreement and the Quality Agreement (as applicable), and in no event shall any such delegation or subcontract release Miltenyi from any of its obligations under this Agreement. Miltenyi's Subcontractors and Affiliates for the manufacture and/or supply of Miltenyi Products will be listed in the Quality Agreement\n\n2.6 Compliance.\n\n(a) Miltenyi shall have sole responsibility for ensuring, and shall ensure, that Miltenyi's and its Affiliates' and Subcontractors' activities and performance in connection with the manufacture of Miltenyi Products and the supply of such Miltenyi Products to Bellicum under this Agreement are at all times in compliance with Applicable Laws. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it shall\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nbe the sole responsibility of Miltenyi to obtain and maintain, and Miltenyi shall obtain and maintain, all licenses, permits, authorizations, or registrations required by Applicable Laws in order for Miltenyi, its Affiliates, and/or Subcontractors (as the case may be) to manufacture and make Delivery of Miltenyi Products, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, at Miltenyi's expense.\n\n(b) Bellicum shall have sole responsibility for ensuring, and shall ensure, that the use of the Miltenyi Products for their respective Permitted Use by Bellicum, its Subcontractors and Licensees (as the case may be) is at all times in compliance with Applicable Laws. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it shall be the sole responsibility of Bellicum to obtain and maintain, and Bellicum shall obtain and maintain, all licenses, permits, authorizations, registrations, additional validations or additional testing required by Applicable Laws in order for Bellicum, its Subcontractors and Licensees to use the Miltenyi Products for the Permitted Use, at Bellicum's expense. Miltenyi shall comply with all reasonable requests for assistance by Bellicum in connection with Bellicum's efforts to obtain such licenses, permits, authorizations, registrations, additional validations or additional testing, to the extent applicable to the Miltenyi Products; provided that the Parties shall agree on the scope of such assistance to be provided by Miltenyi and upon the reasonable costs to be paid by Bellicum to Miltenyi for such assistance.\n\n(c) In the event that Bellicum receives notice from a Regulatory Authority raising any issues concerning the safety or quality of any Miltenyi Product, Bellicum shall promptly notify Miltenyi of the same in writing. Upon receipt of such notification, and subject to Miltenyi's obligations set forth in the Quality Agreement, if applicable, in this regard, Miltenyi shall make [...***...] to cure such safety or quality issue(s) as they relate to the Miltenyi Products as promptly as possible, and unless such issues solely relate to Bellicum's Permitted Use of the relevant Miltenyi Product(s) in connection with the manufacture or use of a Bellicum Product, such efforts shall be at Miltenyi's sole expense.\n\n(d) As of the Effective Date and to and through the expiration or termination of this Agreement, each Party represents, warrants and covenants to the other Party that: (1) such Party, and, to its actual knowledge, its owners, directors, officers, employees, and any agent, representative, Subcontractor or other Third Party acting for or on such its behalf, shall not, directly or indirectly, offer, pay, promise to pay, or authorize such offer, promise or payment, of anything of value, to any person for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business through any improper advantage in connection with this Agreement, or that would otherwise violate any Applicable Laws, rules and regulations concerning or relating to public or commercial bribery or corruption; and (2) its financial books, accounts, records and invoices related to this Agreement or related to any work conducted for or on behalf of the other Party are and will be complete and accurate in all material respects. Each Party may request in writing from time to time that the other Party complete a compliance certification regarding the foregoing in this Section 2.6.\n\n2.7 Violations. Nothing herein contained shall oblige Miltenyi to continue supplying, or Bellicum to continue ordering or purchasing, any Miltenyi Product if such supply or purchase is reasonably believed by Miltenyi or Bellicum, as the case may be, based on objective grounds, to violate Applicable Laws or such Party's licenses, or if the Miltenyi Products supplied to Bellicum infringe, or are alleged to infringe, a Third Party's Intellectual Property Rights.\n\n2.8 Transfer of Miltenyi Products. Bellicum shall have the right to transfer Miltenyi Product(s) purchased hereunder, or to request from Miltenyi, by notice in writing, that Miltenyi Deliver any Miltenyi Product(s) purchased hereunder to an Affiliate of Bellicum or a Subcontractor or Licensee of Bellicum Product designated by Bellicum, solely for the purpose of the Permitted Use, subject to the payment to Miltenyi of all additional expenses (if any) incurred by Miltenyi in connection with such provision and transfer of Miltenyi Product(s) to Bellicum's designee; and provided that in each case: (i) each Subcontractor or Licensee of Bellicum to whom Miltenyi Products are transferred shall be bound in writing by limitations and obligations that are consistent with the corresponding limitations and obligations imposed on Bellicum\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nhereunder and under the Quality Agreement, as applicable; and (ii) notwithstanding the transfer of any Miltenyi Product purchased hereunder, Bellicum will nevertheless continue to remain fully and primarily responsible and liable to Miltenyi for payment of the Product Price and for the use of the Miltenyi Product by any Subcontractor and Licensee to whom a Miltenyi Product is transferred.\n\n2.9 Bellicum Licensees.\n\n(a) If and to the extent that Bellicum grants rights with respect to a Bellicum Product under license or other agreement(s) with one or more Licensees of Bellicum, in no event shall Bellicum grant any rights under Miltenyi Intellectual Property Rights other than as expressly permitted hereunder and as are necessary to use Miltenyi Product for the purpose of the Permitted Use, or any rights that are otherwise inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement or the Quality Agreement.\n\n(b) To the extent that the rights granted to Bellicum hereunder (including Bellicum's right to use each Miltenyi Product for its Permitted Use) are shared with one or more of its Subcontractors or Licensees in accordance with the terms hereof, Bellicum shall first impose limitations and obligations on such Subcontractors or Licensees, in writing, that are consistent with the corresponding limitations and obligations imposed on Bellicum hereunder, and Bellicum shall notify Miltenyi of the name and contact information for each such Subcontractor or Licensee that it shares such rights with, in writing, in accordance with Article 16 of this Agreement.\n\n(c) Bellicum shall promptly notify Miltenyi in writing of any additional Licensee contemplating the use of Miltenyi Product(s) for the manufacture of a Bellicum Product from time to time, which Licensee shall be added to the Bellicum Product specific Module by amendment.\n\n(d) At the reasonable written request of Bellicum during the Term, Miltenyi shall enter into a direct supply agreement for Miltenyi Products with any Licensee nominated by Bellicum, materially consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Quality Agreement (as applicable), except as agreed otherwise in writing between Miltenyi and the respective Bellicum Licensee.\n\n2.10 Liability for Non-Compliance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Bellicum shall, in relation to Miltenyi, at all times and in all respects continue to remain fully and primarily responsible and liable to Miltenyi for the performance and the acts or omissions of its Affiliate, Subcontractor, and Licensee in connection with the subject matter of this Agreement, including the failure of an Affiliate, Subcontractor, or Licensee of Bellicum to comply with all of the limitations and obligations imposed on Bellicum hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Miltenyi shall, in relation to Bellicum, at all times and in all respects continue to remain fully and primarily responsible and liable to Bellicum for the performance and the acts or omissions of its Affiliates and Subcontractors in connection with the subject matter of this Agreement, including the failure of an Affiliate or Subcontractor of Miltenyi to comply with all of the limitations and obligations imposed on Miltenyi hereunder. For clarity, in no event shall any permitted delegation or subcontracting of any activities to be performed in connection with this Agreement release a Party from any of its limitations or obligations under this Agreement.\n\n2.11 Governance.\n\n(a) Alliance Managers. Each Party shall appoint an appropriately qualified individual to serve as an alliance manager under this Agreement (the Alliance Manager). Such persons shall endeavor to assure clear and responsive communication between the Parties and the effective exchange of information, and may serve as the primary point of contact for any matters arising under this Agreement. The Alliance Managers may attend meetings of the JSC, assist in resolving Disputes at the initial level of the Parties' good faith discussions, and may raise issues for discussion by the JSC.\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\n(b) Joint Steering Committee. The Parties hereby establish a joint steering committee (the JSC) that will monitor and provide strategic oversight of the activities under this Agreement, and facilitate communications between the Parties with respect to the supply of Miltenyi Products and Bellicum's development and commercialization of Bellicum Products. Each Party shall initially appoint up to three (3) representatives (or their designees) to the JSC, excluding the Alliance Manager of each Party who will attend JSC meetings in a non- voting capacity. Each such JSC representative of a Party will have sufficient seniority within such Party to make decisions arising within the scope of the JSC's responsibilities. The Parties' initial representatives to the JSC will be provided to each other Party within thirty (30) days after the Effective Date. The JSC may change its size from time to time by mutual consent of its members. Each Party may replace its JSC representatives at any time upon written notice to the other Party; provided, however, that neither Party may replace a representative on the JSC with an individual with lower seniority without the approval of the other Party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. The JSC shall meet at least two times each Calendar Year, and at least one such JSC meeting shall be in person/ face-to-face with alternating locations (for in person/ face-to-face meetings only), unless otherwise agreed in writing by both Parties. Each Party may invite up to three (3) of its own employees, and the JSC may invite other non-members, to participate in the discussions and meetings of the JSC, provided that such participants shall have no voting authority at the JSC. The JSC shall have two (2) co- chairpersons, one from each Party. The role of the co-chairpersons shall be to convene and preside at meetings of the JSC. The Alliance Managers shall work with the co-chairpersons to prepare and circulate agendas and to ensure the preparation of minutes. The co- chairpersons shall have no additional powers or rights beyond those held by the other JSC representatives.\n\n(c) Specific Responsibilities of the JSC. In addition to its overall responsibility for monitoring and providing strategic oversight with respect to the Parties' activities under this Agreement, the JSC shall in particular: (i) oversee the collaborative efforts of the Parties under this Agreement; (ii) review and discuss the research, development and commercialization of Miltenyi Products and Bellicum Products, including regulatory matters related thereto; (iii) attempt to resolve Disputes presented by the Alliance Managers; and (iv) perform such other functions as appropriate to further the purposes of this Agreement, in each case, as agreed in writing by the Parties. The JSC has no authority to modify this Agreement, the Quality Agreement or any Module.\n\nARTICLE 3 PRODUCT QUALITY; CHANGE CONTROL\n\n3.1 Product Quality.\n\n(a) Product Specifications. Miltenyi shall manufacture or have manufactured the Miltenyi Products to meet the agreed Product Specifications, as then in effect, as published by Miltenyi from time to time, or as set forth in the Quality Agreement, as applicable.\n\n(b) Agreed Standards. All Miltenyi Products shall be manufactured and quality controlled in compliance with and pursuant to: (i) the Agreed Standards, (ii) the requirements of the Quality Agreement, if applicable, and (iii) Applicable Laws.\n\n(c) Testing. Miltenyi shall have standard analytical testing performed on each batch of Miltenyi Product to be shipped to Bellicum, in accordance with Agreed Standards and the procedures described in the corresponding documentation, to verify that Miltenyi Product meets Product Specifications and that it was manufactured in accordance with Agreed Standards and Applicable Laws.\n\n(d) Quality System. All Miltenyi Products supplied under this Agreement shall be manufactured and quality controlled under an appropriate quality system in accordance with Agreed Standards, as more fully described in the Quality Agreement (as applicable). Any subsequent change to Miltenyi's quality system that, as Bellicum can reasonably establish, would have or is likely to have a material effect on the safety, efficacy, identity and/or quality of a Miltenyi Product or its Permitted Use, requires the Parties to discuss and agree upon each such change in writing.\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\n(e) Quality Agreement. Within [...***...] days from the Effective Date (or such longer period as agreed by the Parties in writing, but in any event prior to the first delivery of Clinical Grade Product to Bellicum), the Parties shall enter into an agreement on mutually acceptable, commercially reasonable terms that details the quality assurance obligations of each Party relating to Clinical Grade Products (the Quality Agreement). In the event of a conflict between the terms of the Quality Agreement and the terms of this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall govern; provided, however, that the Quality Agreement shall govern in respect of quality issues.\n\n3.2 Change Control.\n\n(a) General. Subject to the terms and limitations set forth in this Section 3.2 and in the Quality Agreement, and unless otherwise agreed between the Parties in writing from time to time, Miltenyi reserves the right to periodically make changes to the Product Specifications, Agreed Standards and/or otherwise with respect to the properties, manufacture and/or testing of the Miltenyi Products (including changes with respect to: suppliers of raw materials; quality in raw materials; methods of manufacturing; packaging; equipment and/or premises; Subcontractors; product control techniques and methods of analysis; product release specifications; and/or presentation and content of relevant documentation, including certificates pursuant to Section 6.5) from time to time during the Term (each, a Change).\n\n(b) Change Notification. Change notifications shall be provided in accordance with the applicable notification procedures set forth in the Quality Agreement or in this Agreement. In the event that Miltenyi proposes a Material Change, unless such proposed Change is a Required Change pursuant to Section 3.2(c) below and there are compelling reasons for earlier implementation of such Required Change, Miltenyi shall give Bellicum at least [...***...] months' advance written notice prior to implementation of the proposed Material Change (a Change Notification). Miltenyi shall be responsible for drafting relevant documentation and shall provide to Bellicum all information reasonably necessary for Bellicum to make appropriate filings with the applicable Regulatory Authority regarding any Change under this subsection, if applicable.\n\n(c) Changes Required for Compliance. If during the Term a Change is required to comply with changes in Agreed Standards made by Regulatory Authorities, Applicable Laws and/or other requirements of a Regulatory Authority, or if Miltenyi determines, in its reasonable judgment, that a Change is required to address safety and/or quality issues in regard to the Miltenyi Product generally (in each case, a Required Change), Miltenyi shall use [...***...] to implement such Required Change at its cost. However, in the event that a Required Change is specifically related to the use of Miltenyi Product for a Permitted Use in relation to a Bellicum Product (a Bellicum-Specific Required Change), then Miltenyi shall use [...***...] to implement such Bellicum-Specific Required Change only if and to the extent Bellicum agrees to reimburse Miltenyi for all documented costs and expenses reasonably incurred by Miltenyi as a result of any such Bellicum-Specific Required Change. Prior to implementing a Required Change in accordance with this Section 3.2(c), Miltenyi shall promptly advise Bellicum as to any scheduling and/or Product Price adjustments which may result from any such Required Change, if any. Miltenyi and Bellicum shall negotiate in good faith in an attempt to reach agreement on (i) the new Product Price, if any, for any Miltenyi Product which embodies such Required Change, giving due consideration to the effect of such change on Miltenyi's manufacturing costs for the changed Miltenyi Product as well as any other relevant factors, (ii) the responsibility for any costs and expenses associated with Miltenyi's activities required to implement such Change, and (iii) any other amendments to this Agreement which may be necessitated by such Change (e.g., an adjustment to the lead time for firm orders). For clarity, Miltenyi shall have no obligation to implement a Bellicum-Specific Required Change unless and until the Parties have reached agreement on all items as described in the preceding sentence.\n\n(d) Changes Requested by Bellicum. If during the Term Bellicum desires Miltenyi to make any Change not necessary to comply with changes in Agreed Standards made by Regulatory\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nAuthorities, Applicable Laws and/or other requirements of Regulatory Authorities (in each case, a Bellicum-Requested Change), Bellicum shall notify Miltenyi thereof in writing. Implementation of any such proposed Bellicum-Requested Change shall be subject to Miltenyi's consent. Miltenyi may withhold its consent to an Bellicum-Requested Change if Miltenyi reasonably determines that such change (i) does not comply with Agreed Standards, Applicable Laws or the requirements of Miltenyi's applicable Regulatory Authority, or (ii) could have potential adverse impact on Miltenyi's manufacturing activities or the sale of the respective Miltenyi Product to other customers. In addition, a Bellicum-Requested Change shall only be implemented following a technical and cost review which shall be conducted as promptly as is reasonably possible and in good faith by Miltenyi, at Bellicum's cost, and shall be subject to Miltenyi and Bellicum reaching agreement as to the one-time costs and revisions to the Product Price necessitated by any such Bellicum-Requested Change. If Bellicum agrees to reimburse Miltenyi for all documented costs and expenses reasonably incurred by Miltenyi as a result of the proposed Bellicum- Requested Change and accepts a proposed Product Price adjustment that reflects a change in Miltenyi manufacturing costs resulting from such Bellicum-Requested Change, Miltenyi shall use [...***...] to implement the proposed Bellicum-Requested Change. For clarity, an agreed adjustment to the Product Price shall become effective only with respect to orders for Miltenyi Products that are manufactured in accordance with the Bellicum-Requested Change.\n\n(e) Changes Requested by Miltenyi. If during the Term Miltenyi wishes to make any Material Change not necessary to comply with changes in Agreed Standards made by Regulatory Authorities, Applicable Laws or other requirements of Regulatory Authorities (in each case, a Miltenyi-Requested Change), Miltenyi shall notify Bellicum in accordance with the Change Notification procedures set forth in Section 3.2(b) and the Quality Agreement before implementation of such Miltenyi-Requested Change (including at least 6 months advance written notice prior to implementation), and shall keep Bellicum advised of its efforts to effectuate such change. Miltenyi shall use its best efforts to provide to Bellicum with a commercially reaosnable number of samples of the Changed Miltenyi Product (meaning such Miltenyi Product that is produced under conditions of the Miltenyi-Requested Change) for evaluation by Bellicum as soon as such Changed Miltenyi Product becomes available during the post-noficiation period. Miltenyi shall be responsible for drafting relevant documentation and shall provide to Bellicum any information reasonably necessary for Bellicum to make appropriate filings with the applicable Regulatory Authority for Bellicum to obtain any required amendment or other modification of the Bellicum Product regulatory approvals regarding changes under this subsection, if applicable. Miltenyi shall implement such Miltenyi-Requested Change at its own cost and expense. If Bellicum does not agree that such Changed Miltenyi Product is acceptable from Bellicum's perspective, then any limitations on or obligations of Bellicum under Article 5 pertaining to forecast variances and Firm Zone ordering in relation to Miltenyi Products affected by such Miltenyi-Requested Change shall not apply, and therefore Bellicum has no obligation to purchase any such Changed Miltenyi Products.\n\n(f) Cooperation. In connection with any Change pursuant to this Section 3.2, the Parties shall cooperate, share information, and otherwise act in good faith to prepare the appropriate documentation as may be necessary to secure and maintain appropriate regulatory approvals or manufacturing permits for Miltenyi Product and Bellicum Product, respectively.\n\n(g) Continued Supply. Except in the event of a Required Change, or other circumstances requiring the prompt implementation of a proposed Material Change (as such circumstances and prompt implementation are notified to Bellicum in writing and if requested by Bellicum, discussed with Bellicum in good faith), Miltenyi shall continue to supply Miltenyi Product without the proposed Material Change for as long a period as is reasonably required for Bellicum, using [...***...], to make all appropriate filings and obtain any required amendment or modification of existing regulatory approvals for Bellicum Product (unless otherwise agreed, such period not to exceed six (6) months from the date of implementation of the Material Change as provided in Miltenyi's Change Notification pursuant to Section 3.2(b)), subject to the Parties reaching agreement, as to the one-time costs and revisions to the Product\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nPrice necessitated by any such continued supply of unchanged Miltenyi Product during such period. Until such agreement is reached, any limitations on or obligations of Bellicum under Article 5 pertaining to forecast variances and Firm Zone ordering in relation to Miltenyi Products described in this subsection (g) shall not apply, and therefore Bellicum has no obligation to purchase any such Miltenyi Products produced after implementation of such Material Change. If the continued supply of unchanged Miltenyi Product under this subsection (g) is reasonably estimated by the Parties to exceed a period of six (6) months from the implementation date of the Material Change notified in a Change Notification pursuant to Section 3.2(b), then the Parties shall promptly meet to discuss in good faith how to remedy the situation.\n\n(h) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (e) and (g), in the event that Bellicum reasonably determines to reject a proposed Material Change (including a Miltenyi-Requested Change), Miltenyi will continue to supply the applicable Miltenyi Product without such change after expiry of the said 6-month period and during the Term of this Agreement, or until Bellicum has secured an alternate source of supply from a Third Party manufacturer; provided, however, that the Parties will discuss in good faith, reflecting the change in circumstances contemplated by this Section 3.2(h), and agree in writing upon commercially reasonable terms to be set forth in an amendment to this Agreement to reflect any demonstrable increased cost and effort (if any) resulting from the manufacture of unchanged Miltenyi Product solely for Bellicum, including (as an example) any applicable adjustments to Forecasts, Lead Times, production cycles, batch sizes, Delivery Dates, Product Prices, or other relevant issues. If the Parties cannot reach agreement regarding such amendment, any obligations of Bellicum in relation to a Forecast for the affected Miltentyi Product in months 7-12 of the applicable Monthly Forecast, and any limitations regarding forecast variances, as each of these are set forth in Article 5, will not apply to a Miltenyi Product produced after implementation of such Material Change (i.e., one that replaces such affected (unchanged) Miltenyi Product), and Miltenyi shall be relieved from any obligations to supply such affected (unchanged) Miltenyi Product under this Agreement after the period described in the first sentence of this subsection (h) ends. For clarity, in no event shall Miltenyi be required to manufacture, supply or sell an existing Miltenyi Product to which a Required Change must be applied.\n\n(i) Research Grade Products. The notification requirements of the second sentence of Section 3.2(b) of this Agreement with respect to Material Changes and the obligations of Section 3.2(g) with respect to Continued Supply shall not apply to Research Grade Products.\n\n(j) Costs. Bellicum shall have responsibility for any Regulatory Authority filing fees and other costs and expenses incurred by Bellicum in connection with any filing or required amendment or other modification of regulatory approvals or consents for Bellicum Product resulting from any Change pursuant this Section 3.2, if applicable.\n\nARTICLE 4 REGULATORY\n\n4.1 Regulatory Responsibility.\n\n(a) Bellicum Product(s). Subject to responsibilities pertaining to Miltenyi Products that are solely reserved by Miltenyi under this Agreement, and subject to the provisions in this Article 4 (including Section 4.7), Bellicum will be solely responsible for all regulatory activities with respect to any Bellicum Product, including the manufacture and quality control thereof.\n\n(b) Miltenyi Product(s). Subject to responsibilities pertaining to Bellicum Product(s) that are solely reserved by Bellicum under this Agreement, and subject to the provisions in this Article 4 (including Section 4.7), Miltenyi will be solely responsible for all regulatory activities with respect to any Miltenyi Product, including the manufacture and quality control thereof.\n\n(c) Disclaimer. Bellicum hereby acknowledges and agrees that, except as specifically set out with respect to any Miltenyi Product in the Product Specifications or in the Quality Agreement, as\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\napplicable, the Miltenyi Products have no approvals by Regulatory Authorities in the Territory for use in diagnostic or therapeutic procedures or other clinical applications, or for any other use requiring compliance with any law or regulation regulating clinical, diagnostic or therapeutic products or any similar product (hereinafter collectively referred to as Regulatory Laws). Bellicum further acknowledges and agrees that Miltenyi Products have not yet been fully tested or validated for safety or effectiveness in connection with Bellicum's Permitted Use. Save as set out in the Product Specifications or the applicable Quality Agreement, it shall be the sole responsibility of Bellicum to test and validate the Miltenyi Products for Bellicum's contemplated Permitted Use hereunder and to take all other actions necessary to establish compliance of Bellicum's Permitted Use thereof with all regulatory requirements, and to ensure that any Bellicum Product resulting from such Permitted Use meets all applicable safety, quality, or other regulatory requirements (including Regulatory Laws), in each case prior to the first use of such Miltenyi Product.\n\n(d) The Miltenyi Products supplied hereunder may not be used for any purpose that would require Regulatory Authority approvals or consents unless such proper Regulatory Authority approvals or consents have been obtained. Bellicum agrees that if it elects to use, or causes any Bellicum Subcontractor or Licensee to use, any Miltenyi Products for a purpose that would subject Miltenyi or such Miltenyi Products to the jurisdiction of any Regulatory Laws, Bellicum will be solely responsible for obtaining any required Regulatory Authority approvals or consents, and for otherwise ensuring that Bellicum's (or its Subcontractors' or Licensees') use of such Miltenyi Products for such purpose complies with such Regulatory Laws. Bellicum shall defend and indemnify Miltenyi and its Affiliates against any liability, damage, loss or expense resulting from or arising out of Bellicum's failure to obtain all necessary Regulatory Authority approvals or consents or to comply with any Regulatory Laws in relation to Bellicum's use of such Miltenyi Products for such purpose.\n\n4.2 Regulatory Authority Requirements. Miltenyi states that (i) Miltenyi is obliged by relevant Regulatory Authorities to keep a record of all of its customer's clinical trials that use Miltenyi Products (name and title of clinical trials, the official registration numbers, name and addresses of the involved principal investigators and clinical trial centers as well as the corresponding formal document granting approval of an IND (for example only, IND/CTA acknowledgement letter of the relevant Regulatory Authority(ies) involving the use of IDE/CRR- labelled Miltenyi Products)) (regardless of whether such clinical trials are sponsored by Miltenyi or by any Third Party); and (ii) Miltenyi is not permitted to provide IDE/CRR-labeled Miltenyi Products to customers in the United States for use in clinical trials if the IND or IDE is not approved by the respective regulatory authority or rejected. . Miltenyi shall act and shall have no liability to Bellicum for acting in accordance with the foregoing requirements. As used herein, CTA means a clinical trial application; IDE means an investigational device exemption; and IDE/CRR references a certain subset of Miltenyi Products labeled with the IDE/CRR designation.\n\n4.3 Regulatory Work. Miltenyi has established, or may from time to time establish, Master Files for one or more Miltenyi Products with one or more Regulatory Authorities in the Territory. Miltenyi shall maintain each such Master File in accordance with Applicable Laws (Regulatory Work). To the extent Bellicum requests that Miltenyi generate any additional Master File and/or add additional information to any existing Master File, the provisions of Section 4.4 Extension of Scope, Supplemental Services below shall apply.\n\n4.4 Extension of Scope, Supplemental Services. With respect to any Bellicum Product, Bellicum may request that Miltenyi provide additional regulatory assistance beyond the scope of the Regulatory Work, and/or may request that Miltenyi perform additional services (i.e. generation of additional supportive data for inclusion in a Master File) that alter, amend, or add to the Regulatory Work. Bellicum shall submit each such request to Miltenyi with reasonable detail in writing. Any request that constitutes a material modification or increase in scope of the Regulatory Work or an agreement for the provision of additional services shall require a written amendment to this Agreement via the Bellicum Product- or Bellicum Program-specific Module signed by authorized representatives of both Parties. Such amendment\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nshall specify in detail any modification or scope change of the Regulatory Work performed by Miltenyi, the appropriate compensation (if any) or basis for such compensation to be paid to Miltenyi by Bellicum for the performance of such additional Regulatory Work assistance or services, and the appropriate time schedule for completion of such additional Regulatory Work assistance or services. Upon executing such written amendment, the additional Regulatory Work assistance or services shall be deemed included within Regulatory Work and subject to the standards of performance described in this Agreement.\n\n4.5 Master Files; Right to Cross Reference. Upon Bellicum's written request, subject to Section 4.9, Miltenyi shall submit a cross reference letter to the appropriate Regulatory Authority(ies) in any Designated Country in which Miltenyi maintains a Master File(s) for the relevant Miltenyi Product(s), authorizing such Regulatory Authority(ies) to access and refer to such Master File(s) for the relevant Miltenyi Product(s) to the extent such information is reasonably required for regulatory purposes to obtain the applicable regulatory approvals for the Permitted Use of the Miltenyi Product(s) and/or the Bellicum Product(s); provided, however, that Bellicum shall first provide to Miltenyi all necessary information about such Bellicum Product that is reasonably included in such cross reference letter.\n\n4.6 Rights to Master Files. Miltenyi shall solely own and retain all rights, title and interest in and to the Master File(s) (and any pertaining regulatory documentation). Bellicum shall have no right to access the Master File(s), or, except as expressly set forth in Section 4.5 supra, to require the disclosure by Miltenyi of any information contained in any Master File, or to cross-reference or otherwise use the Master File(s) for any purpose other than as expressly provided herein.\n\n4.7 Communication to/from Regulatory Authorities.\n\n(a) Communication from Regulatory Authorities. Each Party will promptly notify the other Party in writing of any material communication from any Regulatory Authority that is related specifically to (i) the safety and/or functionality of any Miltenyi Product(s) and/or the use thereof for the manufacture of Bellicum Product or (ii) the safety and/or functionality of any Bellicum Product(s) as the same relate or could relate to a Miltenyi Product and/or the use of Miltenyi Product(s) in the manufacture of Bellicum Product(s), and that would, in each case of (i) and (ii), reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on either Party's products that are the subject matter of this Agreement, or ability of a Party to comply with its obligations under this Agreement (collectively, Communication(s)). Each Party shall, as soon as practicable after any contact with or receipt of any Communication, forward a copy or description of the same (to the extent it so relates) to the other Party. Each Party reserves the right to redact its Confidential Information and confidential Third Party information from such Communications. Each Party shall obligate its Affiliates and Subcontractors accordingly.\n\n(b) Communication to Regulatory Authorities. In the event that a response to a Regulatory Authority is required in connection with any Communication, Bellicum will have sole responsibility for the form and content of any response to a Communication from a Regulatory Authority in connection with any regulatory submission regarding a Bellicum Product, or any non-Miltenyi Product component thereof (Miltenyi will provide its proposed response regarding any Miltenyi Product component thereof), and any non-product-specific information and/or non-procedure-specific information related to Bellicum, and Miltenyi will have sole responsibility for the form and content of any response to a Communication from a Regulatory Authority regarding a Miltenyi Product regulatory submission or any component thereof, the Master Files, and any non-product specific information related to Miltenyi. If Miltenyi's response is requested and needed in connection with any Bellicum Product regulatory submission, and a delayed response is likely to delay development or commercialization of such Bellicum Product, then Miltenyi will promptly use its diligent efforts to provide such response as soon as practicable. At the responding Party's reasonable request and expense, the other Party will collaborate in good faith with the responding Party in preparing such responses and, subject to Sections 4.5 and 4.6, will provide the responding\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nParty with information that the responding Party reasonably believes is required to develop a requested response for questions in relation to such Communication.\n\n(c) Required Communications. If Bellicum is required to communicate with any Regulatory Authority specifically regarding any Miltenyi Product, then Bellicum shall so advise Miltenyi as soon as practicable and, unless prohibited by Applicable Law, or to the extent that such a disclosure would result in the violation of any contractual obligations to a Third Party, provide Miltenyi in advance with a copy of any proposed written Communication with such Regulatory Authority to the extent that such Communication pertains to Miltenyi Products; provided that Bellicum reserves the right to redact its Confidential Information and confidential Third Party information from such copy. Bellicum shall use reasonable efforts to comply with all reasonable direction of Miltenyi pertaining to the foregoing. To the extent permitted by the Regulatory Authority, Miltenyi shall have the right to participate in any planned oral Communications or meetings between Bellicum and any Regulatory Authority specifically relating to Miltenyi Products or Miltenyi Technology. For purposes of clarification, the obligations imposed on Bellicum pursuant to this Section 4.7(c) shall not apply with respect to Communications with Regulatory Authorities that are focused primarily on a non-Miltenyi Product portions or on a Bellicum Product.\n\n4.8 Assistance. Miltenyi shall, if requested by Bellicum, consult with and provide reasonable assistance to Bellicum with regard to regulatory matters concerning the Miltenyi Products, as appropriate, provided that for any assistance regarding regulatory matters that is beyond the scope of standard use of the Miltenyi Products as made available in Miltenyi's catalogue, Bellicum shall pay for Miltenyi's time for such consulting and assistance at Miltenyi's then-standard rates, which scope and limits shall be discussed between the Parties and mutually agreed in writing prior to the performance of the assistance by Miltenyi (subject to the Parties' representations, warranties and liabilities under this Agreement). Absent Miltenyi's gross negligence or willful misconduct, Bellicum shall bear all responsibility for Bellicum's or Bellicum Subcontractors' use of information provided by Miltenyi (including use in regulatory filings and any Third Party liability) pursuant to this Section 4.8.\n\n4.9 Additional Filings. Bellicum acknowledges that, as of the Effective Date, Master Files in relation to Miltenyi's supply obligations have not been filed in all jurisdictions worldwide. If Bellicum desires to pursue clinical evaluations related to the approvability or approval of any Bellicum Product or decides to pursue commercialization of any Bellicum Product in any jurisdiction where Miltenyi does not then have an active Master File, and Bellicum would not legally be able to conduct such evaluation or commercialization without Miltenyi filing a Master File in such jurisdiction or making necessary information available to the Regulatory Authority, then Bellicum shall so notify Miltenyi, and the Parties shall discuss in good faith the terms and conditions under which Miltenyi would be willing to file such Master File or provide necessary information to the Regulatory Authority including additional compensation to Miltenyi (if any), but Miltenyi shall not be obligated to file such Master File or provide such information, unless the Parties mutually agree in writing on such commercially reasonable terms and conditions. To the extent requested by Bellicum in writing from time to time to amend the Bellicum Product specific Module to include Additional Countries, Miltenyi shall work in good faith with Bellicum to include such Additional Countries in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.3 supra.\n\n4.10 Disclaimer. Except as provided in this Article 4 or otherwise in the Agreement, Miltenyi provides no warranty that any Master File or other regulatory dossier or submission by Miltenyi or Bellicum will be approved by any Regulatory Authority. Miltenyi shall in no way be held responsible for any refusal by any Regulatory Authority or ethics committee to grant permission to conduct a clinical trial(s) and/or for any refusal by any Regulatory Authority to grant approval under an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) or under a Biological License Application (BLA) or for compassionate use for a Bellicum Product.\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nARTICLE 5 FORECASTS AND ORDERS\n\n5.1 Forecasts. In order to assist Miltenyi with its capacity, procurement and production planning, and as a general framework for forecasting Bellicum's orders of Miltenyi Products (where more specific parameters may be set forth in a given Module), Bellicum agrees to provide Miltenyi with rolling forecasts of Bellicum's (and its Subcontractors' and Licensees') anticipated quantity requirements for Miltenyi Products in the Forecast Territory during the Term of this Agreement, in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.1 (each, a Forecast). There is no binding forecasting obligation for Research Grade Products, except (if applicable) as otherwise explicitly agreed in a Module. Any modified forecasting terms and conditions for a particular Bellicum Product or Bellicum Program that supplement this Article 5 will be set forth in the Module applicable to that Bellicum Product or Bellicum Program. All of the Forecasts provided under this Agreement will break down the demand of Miltenyi Products on a product-by-product (expressed in number of units) and manufacturing country-by-manufacturing country basis (i.e., Forecast Territory only) and substantially follow the mutually agreed Miltenyi forecast sheet, as attached hereto in Exhibit C 1-3. All Forecasts provided by Bellicum will be good faith estimates of Bellicum's anticipated quantity requirements for Miltenyi Products during the relevant period. Bellicum agrees to use [...***...] in preparing all Forecasts provided hereunder to minimize variances between Forecasts. Each Forecast shall be duly signed by an authorized representative of Bellicum (or Bellicum's designee on behalf of Bellicum) and submitted in writing to Miltenyi, by mail, email or facsimile, and shall supersede prior Forecasts to the extent the Forecast overlaps with prior Forecasts.\n\n(a) Rolling Monthly Forecast; Firm Zone. Within [...***...] Business Days of the Effective Date, and thereafter by the [...***...] day of each Calendar Month during the Term, Bellicum shall submit a monthly rolling Forecast of Bellicum's anticipated quantity requirements for Miltenyi Products within the Forecast Territory (on a manufacturing country-by-manufacturing country basis) for each of the next twelve (12) consecutive Calendar Months (e.g., year 1: months 1-12), commencing with the Calendar Month in which such Forecast is submitted (each, a Monthly Forecast). (For clarity, the initial Monthly Forecast will cover Calendar Year 1, i.e., Calendar Months 1-12; the following Monthly Forecast will cover the twelve Calendar Months period following the Calendar Month 1 of the previous Monthly Forecast, i.e., Calendar Months 2-13.) The Monthly Forecast shall show quantities forecasted on a monthly basis, and for the first (1st) three (3) months shall state the desired dates of Delivery for the forecasted quantities. With respect to any Monthly Forecast for Miltenyi Products submitted during the Term, [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) of the quantities forecasted for the first (1st) three (3) month period of each Monthly Forecast (each such 3-month period will be referred to as the Firm Zone) shall be binding, and the corresponding portion of each subsequent Monthly Forecast shall be consistent with such period. For clarity, all forecasted quantities of Miltenyi Products during the Firm Zone shall constitute a binding commitment by Bellicum to submit corresponding Purchase Orders for Miltenyi Products. The Parties agree that, except with respect to the Firm Zone and any additional conditions set forth in a given Module, a Monthly Forecast provided by Bellicum will not be binding upon both Parties.\n\n(b) Rolling Quarterly Forecast. Within [...***...] Business Days of the Effective Date, and thereafter by the [...***...] day of each last month of a Calendar Quarter during the Term, Bellicum shall submit a non-binding quarterly rolling Forecast of Bellicum's anticipated quantity requirements for Miltenyi Products for each of the four (4) Calendar Quarters immediately following the last month of such Calendar Quarter (each, a Quarterly Forecast). Each Quarterly Forecast shall show anticipated quantity requirements on a quarterly basis. (For clarity, the initial Quarterly Forecast will cover Calendar Year 2, i.e. Calendar Quarters 1, 2, 3 and 4 (covering Calendar Months 13-15, 16-18, 19-21 and 22-24); the following Quarterly Forecast will cover the four Calendar Quarter period following the Calendar Quarter 1 of the previous Quarterly Forecast, i.e. Calendar Quarters 2-5.) A Quarterly Forecast provided by Bellicum will not be binding upon both Parties.\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\n(c) Long-Term Forecast. In addition, Bellicum (or Bellicum's designee on behalf of Bellicum) shall within [...***...] days of the Effective Date, and thereafter by [...***...] of each Calendar Year during the Term, submit a non-binding annual rolling Forecast of Bellicum's anticipated quantity requirements for Miltenyi Products for each of the next three (3) consecutive Calendar Years, commencing with the Calendar Year in which such Forecast is submitted (each, a Long-Term Forecast) for the purposes of assisting Miltenyi with its capacity and production planning for Miltenyi Products during such period. Each Long-Term Forecast shall show anticipated quantity requirements on an annual basis. (For clarity, the initial Long-Term Forecast will cover the Calendar Years 3 to 5; the following Long-Term Forecast will cover the Calendar Years period following the previous Calendar Year 3 of the previous Long-Term Forecast, i.e. Calendar Years 4-5.) A Long Term Forecast provided by Bellicum will not be binding upon both Parties and shall serve to assess future capacity planning at Miltenyi.\n\n(d) Forecasts Due Periodically. In the event that Miltenyi has failed to receive an updated Forecast for any relevant forecast period within the times or by the dates provided in clauses (a) through (c) above, Miltenyi shall promptly notify Bellicum of such failure in writing and, if Bellicum fails to respond with an updated Forecast by the [...***...] day of a Calendar Month of the relevant forecast period, the most recent Forecast shall be regarded as current.\n\n(e) Acceptable Forecast Variance. Outside the Firm Zone, Bellicum may increase or decrease the amount of Miltenyi Product forecast for each Calendar Month of each Monthly Forecast by up to [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) for Calendar Months 4 through 6, and by [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) for Calendar Months 7 through 12, compared to the amount of Miltenyi Product that was forecast for the comparable Calendar Month in the prior Monthly Forecast provided in accordance with this Agreement, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, (e.g., the forecast for the fourth Calendar Month in a Monthly Forecast may not increase or decrease by more than [...***...]% of the amount of any particular Miltenyi Product in any particular country forecast for the fifth Calendar Month of the prior Monthly Forecast). For clarity, variances with respect to forecasts submitted for any Calendar Month within the Firm Zone shall not be acceptable.\n\n5.2 Volume Limitations.\n\n(a) Subject to Bellicum's adherence to its Forecast obligations pursuant to Section 5.1 above, or as specifically modified in a specific Module, Miltenyi shall meet the demands of any Purchase Orders (as defined below) that are made by Bellicum in compliance with the Forecasts. Miltenyi shall not be obligated to supply Bellicum with quantities of Miltenyi Product in excess of [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) of the most recent Forecast provided to Miltenyi but agrees to use [...***...] to satisfy Bellicum's requirement of Miltenyi Product in excess of [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) of the relevant Forecast quantities in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.\n\n(b) In the event that Miltenyi becomes aware that it is or will be unable to supply any desired quantity of Miltenyi Product pursuant to a Purchase Order that falls within the relevant Forecast on or before the applicable Delivery date(s) therefor, Miltenyi shall promptly inform Bellicum, and then, the Parties shall, in good faith, seek to agree on a revised date (or dates) for Delivery. If Miltenyi fails to propose a reasonably acceptable plan for the Delivery, Bellicum may, to be determined in Bellicum's reasonable discretion and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, at its option, cancel the Purchase Order.\n\n5.3 Firm Zone Requirements. Unless otherwise set forth in a relevant Module, the quantity of Miltenyi Product(s) forecasted for each Calendar Month of the Firm Zone of the most recent rolling Monthly Forecast submitted pursuant to Section 5.1(a) of this Agreement shall be binding on both Parties, commencing on the Effecctive Date of the Agreement (but not for the first three months thereto), and in each Calendar Month during the Term, Bellicum shall have the firm obligation to order at a minimum the amount of Miltenyi Product(s) specified for the first (1st) Calendar Month of the most recent rolling Monthly Forecast\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\n(such amount, the Firm Zone Requirements). The Firm Zone Requirement shall not apply within the first three months of the Effective Date of the Agreement. Within [...***...] days of the end of each Calendar Quarter, Miltenyi will calculate the total Firm Zone Requirements for each of the three (3) Calendar Months during that Calendar Quarter. In the event that Bellicum fails to order the Firm Zone Requirements of Miltenyi Product from Miltenyi during any particular Calendar Month in the relevant Calendar Quarter in which Miltenyi was ready, willing and able to Deliver Miltenyi Product in accordance with the applicable Monthly Forecast, then the Firm Zone Order Shortfall shall be the total amount by which the Firm Zone Requirements for any given Calendar Month during such Calendar Quarter exceed the amount of Miltenyi Product actually ordered by Bellicum during such Calendar Month. Miltenyi will invoice Bellicum for an amount equal to the Firm Zone Shortfall and Bellicum will pay such invoice within [...***...] days of the invoice date. Upon Bellicum's request and subject to payment of the Firm Zone Shortfall amount by Bellicum, Miltenyi will, if so requested by Bellicum, provide Bellicum with Miltenyi's remaining stock of the relevant forecasted Miltenyi Products equal in value to such Firm Zone Shortfall amount.\n\n5.4 Purchase Orders. This Section 5.4 sets forth a general framework for Purchase Order-related terms and conditions, which shall apply unless modified terms and conditions for a particular Bellicum Product are set forth in its corresponding Module.\n\n(a) Bellicum shall order Miltenyi Products by submitting written purchase orders to Miltenyi, in such form as the Parties may agree from time to time and in accordance with any applicable Lead Times and the provisions of this Article 5 (each, a Purchase Order). All Purchase Orders (and any related acceptances or objections by Miltenyi) may be delivered electronically or by other means to Miltenyi's applicable sales representative located in the country of the shipping destination or to such location as Miltenyi shall reasonably designate from time to time.\n\n(b) Each Purchase Order will specify the MB Global Contract Number assigned to this Agreement, the volumes of Miltenyi Product(s) ordered, the desired Delivery date(s) the Miltenyi Products are to be made available to Bellicum for pick-up by Bellicum's designated carrier or freight forwarder, the relevant ship-to address, and any special shipping instructions. Bellicum will order Miltenyi Product in a defined number of units, subject to reasonable minimum order size requirements that may vary according to product type.\n\n(c) Bellicum shall submit each Purchase Order to Miltenyi reasonably prior to the desired Delivery date(s), which shall be no sooner than the applicable Lead Time(s) for the relevant Miltenyi Product(s); provided that absent an applicable Lead Time, the Purchase Order shall be submitted at least [...***...] days in advance of the desired Delivery date specified in such Purchase Order; and provided further that Miltenyi shall use diligent and good faith efforts to Deliver before the desiredDelivery date.\n\n(d) Purchase Orders shall be firm and binding upon written acceptance by Miltenyi. Miltenyi shall confirm acceptance of the Purchase Order by written notice (sent by fax, mail, overnight courier or e-mail) to Bellicum within [...***...] Business Days of receipt of the Purchase Order from Bellicum. If Miltenyi fails to confirm acceptance of a Purchase Order within [...***...] Business Days of receipt of the Purchase Order from Bellicum, then Bellicum will contact Miltenyi to verify Miltenyi's receipt and acceptance of such Purchase Order and request written confirmation thereof from Miltenyi. Miltenyi shall accept all Purchase Orders for quantities of Miltenyi Product that are within the Firm Zone Requirement amounts specified for the relevant Calendar Month in the applicable Monthly Forecast.\n\n(e) Each Purchase Order shall reference the MB Global Contract Reference Number (MBGCR) defined in the respective Modules, submitted by Bellicum to Miltenyi shall be governed exclusively by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the relevant Module and the applicable Quality Agreement. None of the terms and conditions set forth on any Purchase Order, order form, invoice, acceptance, objection or similar document shall change or modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and the Parties hereby agree that the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the relevant Module shall\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nsupersede any conflicting term or condition set forth in any Purchase Order, order form, invoice, acceptance, objection or similar document furnished by Bellicum to Miltenyi or by Miltenyi to Bellicum, as the case may be. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchase Orders may only contain products to be ordered under a single MBGCR. The combination of products referring to different MBGCR in one Purchase Order, or a combination of products referencing a MBGCR and products not referencing a MBGCR in one Purchase Order is not possible.\n\n(f) In the event of a Bellicum Product safety issue, withdrawal or hold on use of a Bellicum Product by a Regulatory Authority or other issue that directly results in a material reduction or elimination of Bellicum's quantity requirements for a particular Miltenyi Product(s), the Parties will discuss promptly and in good faith adjustments to the permitted forecast variance described in Section 5.1(e) during the period when such circumstance exists, and other steps that could be taken to soften the impact of such circumstance on each Party.\n\n5.5 Changes to Purchase Orders. Subject to Section 5.2 and applicable Lead Times, Miltenyi shall use [...***...] to comply with unplanned changes in Purchase Orders requested by Bellicum either in terms of quantities or Delivery dates. All requests for changes to Purchase Orders shall be submitted in writing. Bellicum shall be responsible for all supplementary costs that result from the implementation of any unplanned change to an accepted Purchase Order requested by Bellicum.\n\n5.6 Minimum Purchases. This Section 5.6 sets forth a general framework for Minimum Purchases-related terms and conditions, which shall apply unless modified terms and conditions for a particular Bellicum Product are set forth in its corresponding Module. In the event Bellicum's aggregate purchases of Miltenyi Products from Miltenyi under this Agreement in any Calendar Year during the Term is less than [...***...]% of the Rolling Monthly Forecast subject to Sections 5.1 and 5.3, at the beginning of that Calendar Year or \u20ac[...***...] ([...***...] Euros), whatever is higher, (the Minimum Purchase), then Miltenyi shall provide written notice to Bellicum of such shortfall. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, and for Calendar Year 2019 only, the \u20ac[...***...] amount recited as an element used to determine the Minimum Purchase in a Calendar Year is hereby reduced to \u20ac[...***...]. Bellicum shall have [...***...] days to tender a firm Purchase Order for the purchase of such shortfall to satisfy the Minimum Purchase requirements set forth above. If Bellicum fails to tender such firm Purchase Order and has not otherwise met the Minimum Purchase requirements within said [...***...]-day period, then Miltenyi, in its sole discretion, effective immediately upon Bellicum's receipt of written notice of Miltenyi's election to do so, shall have no obligation to Bellicum under this Agreement:\n\n(1) not to discontinue the supply of any particular Miltenyi Product;\n\n(2) to use [...***...] to ensure continuous supply of Miltenyi Products to Bellicum in accordance with Forecasts provided by or on behalf of Bellicum; and\n\n(3) to provide Regulatory Work in accordance with Section 4.3.\n\nMinimum Purchases referred to above will include the quantities of Miltenyi Product(s) ordered by Bellicum in accordance with applicable Forecasts that could not be supplied by Miltenyi. At the time Bellicum reaches the Minimum Purchase requirements again, Miltenyi and Bellicum shall in good faith agree to continue the supply commitment.\n\nARTICLE 6 DELIVERY\n\n6.1 Delivery; Shipment.\n\n(a) Each quantity of Miltenyi Product(s) ordered by Bellicum in a particular Purchase Order pursuant to this Agreement shall be delivered FCA (Incoterms 2010) Miltenyi's Facility by delivery\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nof the shipped goods to Bellicum's designated carrier or freight forwarder, in adequate packaging and ready for loading, on the Delivery Date (Delivery).\n\n(b) Each shipment of Miltenyi Products will be picked up by Bellicum's designated carrier on the agreed delivery date(s) (each, a Delivery Date) confirmed by Miltenyi for the applicable Purchase Order in accordance with applicable Lead Time(s), during normal business hours (Monday to Friday, excluding statutory holidays) unless special arrangements are agreed to by Miltenyi in writing. Bellicum shall be responsible for all arrangements regarding loading, shipment, insurance from Miltenyi's Facility to the ultimate destination and import customs clearances at the destination country, except as otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing. Alternatively, upon Bellicum's written request, Miltenyi will make all necessary shipping arrangements on behalf of Bellicum with a carrier designated by Bellicum, on Bellicum's responsibility. Bellicum shall provide Miltenyi with a list of approved carriers. Bellicum also shall be responsible for all of the following costs and charges, as applicable: loading charges of the designated carrier, freight charges and other shipping expenses from Miltenyi's Facility to the ultimate destination, expenses for insurance of goods during transit, import customs clearances.\n\n(c) Upon Delivery, Bellicum will cause its carrier to verify the gross and visually observable physical integrity of all Miltenyi Product packaging prior to loading and to acknowledge proper receipt of the Miltenyi Products by signing the relevant transport documentation.\n\n(d) Miltenyi shall have the Miltenyi Products appropriately labelled with a traceable lot or batch number and packaged for shipping in commercial packaging materials in compliance with Agreed Standards, Miltenyi's standard procedures and, the applicable Quality Agreement.\n\n(e) Quantities actually Delivered to Bellicum or Bellicum's designee pursuant to an accepted Purchase Order may not vary from the quantities reflected in such Purchase Order without Bellicums' prior written consent; provided, however, that if Bellicum so consents to a variance in quantities actually Delivered (as compared to quantities set forth in an accepted Purchase Order), Bellicum shall only be invoiced and required to pay for the quantities of Miltenyi Product that Miltenyi actually Delivered to Bellicum or Bellicum's designee. In the event that Bellicum consents to accept Delivery of less than the quantities of Miltenyi Product in an accepted Purchase Order, Miltenyi shall include, in the next shipment of Miltenyi Product to Bellicum, any quantities ordered pursuant to an accepted Purchase Order but not actually delivered on the designated Delivery date. If a delay in any such Delivery of Miltenyi Products exceeds ten (10) Days, then Bellicum may require a pro rata reduction in its then-current Monthly Forecast to account for such delay.\n\n6.2 Title and Risk. Title and risk of loss or damage to Miltenyi Products shall pass to Bellicum as defined by Incoterm FCA (Incoterms 2010). Should any of the Delivered Miltenyi Products be damaged during transit to Bellicum or Bellicum's designee, then notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.4, a replacement order to replace such damaged Miltenyi Products shall be fulfilled, even if the volume limitations defined in Section 5.2 are exceeded, by Miltenyi in good faith and as soon as practicable (and such replacement order shall be considered a new Purchase Order during the applicable Firm Zone).\n\n6.3 Partial Delivery. With Bellicum's specific prior written consent, Miltenyi may make partial shipment against Purchase Orders, to be separately invoiced with each shipment and paid for when due in accordance with this Agreement. For such partial shipments, Miltenyi will pay all shipment costs associated with such subsequent or additional shipments.\n\n6.4 Minimum Guaranteed Shelf Life. Miltenyi shall ensure that, at the time of Delivery the remaining shelf life of each shipped Miltenyi Product shall be no less than the minimum shelf life set forth in Exhibit B as such Exhibit B Module may be amended from time to time by written notification of Miltenyi to Bellicum. As of the Effective Date the Minimum Guaranteed Shelf Life of certain Miltenyi Products is relatively short and thus requires Bellicum to perform a tight materials management (i.e. short-termed\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nordering of such Miltenyi Products) regarding production planning of Bellicum Product. The Parties mutually agree to use their [...***...] to implement any back-office activities as necessary to implement a) an increased Minimum Guaranteed Shelf Life and/or b) improvements to material management and production planning to address the challenge in the previous sentence and the Parties agree to provide to each other reasonable assistance where practicable to implement such back-office changes as necessary, taking into account cost, resource and capacity requirements.\n\n6.5 Certificates. Miltenyi shall include proper release certificates, certificates of compliance, and/or certificates of analysis with all shipments of Miltenyi Product, as applicable, in accordance with the requirements of the Quality Agreement.\n\n6.6 Product Shortage. Miltenyi shall promptly notify Bellicum of any potential or anticipated shortfall in the manufacturing or inventory of any Miltenyi Product that may adversely affect the Delivery of such Miltenyi Product in accordance with Bellicum's forecast requirements and pending Purchase Orders therefor. If Miltenyi is unable to supply any Miltenyi Product subject to a pending Purchase Order for any reason, then the Parties shall, in good faith, seek to agree on a revised date (or dates) for Delivery and Miltenyi shall undertake prompt and diligent efforts to mitigate the adverse impact on Bellicum. In the case of a limited availability of any Miltenyi Product, in selling such Miltenyi Product, Miltenyi shall take into account the aggregate volume of Miltenyi Products purchased by Bellicum, and shall subject to reasonable ethical standards provide to Bellicum priority access to Miltenyi Product consistent with such Miltenyi Product purchase volumes and critical medical needs. If due to the fault or error of Miltenyi or a Third-Party supplier or Subcontractor of Miltenyi or Force Majeure, Miltenyi fails to deliver any Miltenyi Product in the quantities specified in Bellicum's Purchase Order, Miltenyi shall use all [...***...] that may be necessary in order to minimize the shortfall, and deliver the ordered Miltenyi Product as soon as possible. If Miltenyi fails to propose a reasonably acceptable plan for the Delivery or if the delay is more than thirty (30) days following the confirmed Delivery Date, Bellicum may, at its reasonable election and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, cancel the Purchase Order(s) without penalty.\n\n6.7 Continuity of Supply.\n\n(a) Contingent upon Bellicum's continued adherence to its obligations in accordance with this Agreement, including the Forecast obligations and Firm Zone Requirements pursuant to Sections 5.1 and 5.3 above, Miltenyi shall use [...***...] have and devote adequate manufacturing capacity to ensure continuous supply of Miltenyi Products to Belicum in accordance with the Forecasts during the Term, in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.7. However, Miltenyi's compliance with this Section 6.7(a) shall not require Miltenyi to incur any significant expenses to purchase new equipment, to install equipment purchased or requested by Bellicum, or to add (or, for clarity, allocate or dedicate) additional manufacturing or storage capacity for the manufacturing and supply of Miltenyi Products to Bellicum hereunder.\n\n(b) In the event that Miltenyi becomes aware that it will not be able, or is likely not to be able, to produce all of Bellicum's forecast requirements of Miltenyi Products from its primary facility located in Bergisch Gladbach, Germany, Miltenyi shall determine, at its option and expense, to establish additional or alternative manufacturing and supply capability for the Miltenyi Products by qualifying and maintaining one or more back-up manufacturing facilities at the premises of Miltenyi and/or any of its Affiliates (each, a Secondary Location). Use of a Secondary Location must be notified to Bellicum in writing in accordance with the Change Notification processes set forth in Section 3.2. Miltenyi shall use its best efforts to provide to Bellicum with a commercially reasonable number of samples of the Secondary Location Miltenyi Products (meaning such Miltenyi Products that are produced at such Secondary Location) for evaluation by Bellicum as soon as each such Secondary Location Miltenyi Product becomes available during the post-noficiation period. In the event that Miltenyi decides to qualify a Secondary Location for the supply of Miltenyi Products hereunder, it shall provide reasonable prior written notice thereof (not less than\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nsix (6) months in advance) to Bellicum, including such details as Bellicum reasonably requires to assess the qualifications of such Secondary Location. Miltenyi shall have sole responsibility for all activities in connection with the setup and approval of the Secondary Location, including for establishing proof of product equivalence for Miltenyi Products produced at the Secondary Location, process and equipment validation and for filing all submissions or other correspondence with Miltenyi's applicable Regulatory Authorities in connection with the Secondary Location.\n\n(c) In addition, Miltenyi may from time to time determine, in its sole discretion, to have one or more Miltenyi Products manufactured, assembled and/or supplied, in whole or in part, by a Subcontractor chosen by Miltenyi and reasonably acceptable to Bellicum. Miltenyi shall provide Bellicum with prior written notification of such Change in accordance with the applicable notification procedures as set forth in the Section Change Control and in the Quality Agreement, if applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Miltenyi shall remain responsible for the fulfilment of its supply and other obligations hereunder with respect to any Miltenyi Product manufactured by Miltenyi's Subcontractor. Miltenyi shall be solely responsible for providing proof of product equivalence and for filing all submissions or other correspondence with the applicable governmental or regulatory authorities in connection with any decision to seek approval of a Third Party subcontractor site for the Miltenyi Products. Further, Miltenyi shall be solely responsible for all process and equipment validation required by the responsible Regulatory Authorities and the regulations thereunder and shall take all steps reasonably necessary to pass government inspection by such Regulatory Authorities\n\n(d) In addition, the Parties shall from time to time discuss in good faith and mutually and reasonably agree upon (i) whether one or more Miltenyi Products require a minimum inventory to be held by Bellicum, and (ii) whether there shall be any type of Miltenyi Product that require a minimum inventory to be held by Miltenyi on behalf of Bellicum and under which terms and conditions such minimum inventory shall be reserved for Bellicum.\n\n6.8 Continuity of Supply - Commercial Phase.\n\nIf a given Module involves supply of Miltenyi Products for Bellicum's Commercial Phase activities, Section 6.8(b) shall apply, provided that additional terms and conditions regarding continuity of supply for such Commercial Phase activities pursuant to such Module have been negotiated in good faith and mutually agreed upon in such Module. The Parties acknowledge that provisions in such Module relating to additional terms and conditions regarding such continuity of supply will depend on the specific Miltenyi Product(s) that are relevant to such Module, and further acknowledge that such provision(s) in such Module may be subject to the Parties' good faith negotiation and mutual agreement regarding additional terms and conditions relevant to minimum purchase requirements (if any) for Miltenyi Product(s) under a Module.\n\n(a) Principal Terms.\n\n(1) In the event of a Supply Failure (as defined below), Bellicum shall have the option to request Miltenyi to establish, as soon as reasonably feasible and at Miltenyi's sole cost and expense, a Secondary Location reasonably capable of making up the Supply Failure of the affected Miltenyi Product (the Affected Miltenyi Product), and if Miltenyi should either (i) notify Bellicum in writing that it is not willing and/or capable to establish a Secondary Location, or (ii) should not have established such Secondary Location and made up the Supply Failure within a reasonable period of time with regard to the Affected Miltenyi Product from receipt of Bellicum's written request therefore, then Bellicum shall, at Bellicum's sole cost and expense, have the right to select, qualify, and maintain an additional second source manufacturing facility as a back-up manufacturing facility for the Affected Miltenyi Products at the premises of a Third Party (the Second-Source Supplier). In the event that Bellicum elects to qualify a Second-Source Supplier for an Affected Miltenyi Product, it shall provide Miltenyi with prior written notice to Miltenyi including such details as Miltenyi reasonably requires to assess the qualifications of such Second-Source Supplier. Any such Second-Source Supplier shall be subject to the prior written consent of Miltenyi, which\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nshall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except as necessary in Miltenyi's reasonable judgment to protect the bona fide and legitimate interests of Miltenyi in protecting its proprietary Intellectual Property Rights from misappropriation or misuse (e.g., by disclosure to a Miltenyi Competitor). If Miltenyi so withholds its consent, it shall propose alternative Second-Source Suppliers reasonably acceptable to both Miltenyi and Bellicum. If the Parties fail to identify a mutually acceptable Second-Source Supplier within thirty (30) days, Bellicum may proceed with an alternative Second-Source Supplier of its choice (however not a Miltenyi Competitor) without Miltenyi's consent.\n\n(2) For purposes hereof, each of the following events shall be deemed a Supply Failure:\n\n(i) if Miltenyi, using [...***...], fails to deliver to Bellicum at least [...***...]% (on a Miltenyi Product-by-Miltenyi Product basis) of an accepted Purchase Order of Miltenyi Product placed by Bellicum in accordance with the relevant binding Forecast within a reasonable period of time after the agreed Delivery Date therefor (whether by reason of Force Majeure or otherwise) more than twice during any Calendar Year; provided, however, that any of the foregoing events shall not be considered a Supply Failure to the extent that it results from:\n\n(x) an act or omission of Bellicum, including any specific written instructions or requirements issued by Bellicum, including an Bellicum- Requested Change; or\n\n(y) the failure or delay on the part of any supplier of materials designated and required by Bellicum or any other Subcontractor designated and required by Bellicum; or\n\n(z) a Required Change or other change in any material requirement relating to the development, manufacturing, packaging and shipping of Miltenyi Product at Miltenyi's facility required by Applicable Laws, or the imposition of any other condition with respect to the Miltenyi Product by any governmental body or agency, or Regulatory Authority, based on Applicable Laws, or an event of Force Majeure, unless Miltenyi fails to use [...***...] to remedy the failure, inability, or delay within a reasonable period of time. In the event of the foregoing failures, inabilities, or delays, the Parties shall meet and discuss in good faith how to remedy the situation.\n\n(ii) If Miltenyi fails to Deliver to Bellicum at least [...***...]% (on a Miltenyi Product-by-Miltenyi Product basis) of an accepted Purchase Order, then for that Miltenyi Product affected by such failed Delivery, the next step in the Discount scheme set forth in Exhibit F shall be applied to such Miltenyi Product during the following two (2) Calendar Quarters (and a repeated failure shall result in further step in the Discount scheme being applied in like manner).\n\n(3) In the event that Bellicum selects a Second-Source Supplier over Miltenyi's reasonable objection, Miltenyi shall not be responsible to Bellicum for the performance of the said Second-Source Supplier. Any such Second-Source Supplier shall, as a condition of qualification, provide reasonable and customary undertakings to Miltenyi related to the protection of Miltenyi's Confidential Information. Bellicum shall be primarily responsible, with Miltenyi's reasonable cooperation and assistance, for providing proof of product equivalence and for filing all submissions or other correspondence with the applicable governmental or regulatory authorities in connection with any decision to seek approval of a manufacturing facility as Second-Source Supplier for Affected Miltenyi Product. Further, Bellicum shall be primarily responsible, with Miltenyi's reasonable assistance, for all process and equipment validation\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nrequired by the responsible Regulatory Authorities and the regulations thereunder and shall take all steps reasonably necessary to pass government inspection by such Regulatory Authorities.\n\n(4) In the event of a Supply Failure, Miltenyi shall grant Bellicum's Second-Source Supplier a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, one-site production license, without the right to sublicense, under Miltenyi's Intellectual Property Rights solely to the extent reasonably necessary to manufacture the Affected Miltenyi Product for the Permitted Use by Bellicum at Bellicum's cost. For the avoidance of doubt, a Second-Source Supplier's license under this subsection shall not permit the manufacture of any Miltenyi Product that is not subject to Supply Failure. A Second-Source Supplier's license hereunder shall subsist until such time as Miltenyi and Bellicum reach agreement on alternative license and/or supply arrangements which shall, inter alia, take into consideration: (i) Miltenyi's interest in regaining control over the manufacture of Miltenyi Products, (ii) Bellicum's interest in securing continuity of supply of the Affected Miltenyi Product(s), (iii) the costs incurred by Bellicum in establishing the Second-Source Supplier to rectify the applicable Supply Failure, (iv) the avoidance of potential adverse effects (supply disruption) that may result from the transfer of manufacturing back to Miltenyi, and (v) the appropriate sharing of costs resulting from the Supply Failure.\n\n(5) In furtherance of the Second-Source Supplier's license grant pursuant to subsection (4) above, Miltenyi shall, to the extent reasonably necessary:\n\n(i) provide the Second-Source Supplier, subject to a non-disclosure agreement on terms no less restrictive than those set forth herein, with prompt access to the documentation, protocols, assays, SOPs, materials, including biological materials, and other know-how and information constituting the manufacturing process of the Affected Miltenyi Product(s);\n\n(ii) assist the Second-Source Supplier with the working up and use of Miltenyi's technology, including providing a reasonable level of technical assistance and consultation;\n\n(iii) provide the Second-Source Supplier with additional disclosures of information and technical assistance and consultation as necessary to keep the Second-Source Supplier informed of the then-current Miltenyi Intellectual Property Rights and the then-current manufacturing process(es) for the Affected Miltenyi Product(s); and\n\n(iv) provide such other assistance to Bellicum and the Second-Source Supplier as may be reasonably required to give effect to such license.\n\n(6) Unless Miltenyi is in material breach, Bellicum will pay for work requested by Bellicum and conducted by or on behalf of Miltenyi, and reimburse Miltenyi for all reasonable and necessary costs and expenses incurred by Miltenyi, in establishing and maintaining Bellicum's Second-Source Supplier for an Affected Miltenyi Product.\n\nARTICLE 7 ACCEPTANCE AND REJECTION.\n\n7.1 Acceptance Testing. Bellicum or (for Miltenyi Product purchased by Bellicum but shipped directly to a Bellicum's Affiliate, Subcontractor, or Licensee) Bellicum's designated recipient of the\n\nshipment of Miltenyi Product will promptly upon Delivery visually inspect each shipment of Miltenyi Product delivered hereunder to (i) determine whether such Miltenyi Product is damaged and (ii) verify that the quantity of Miltenyi Product delivered conforms with the Purchase Order and other applicable documentation. Further, Bellicum shall have a period of [...***...] days from the date of Delivery to\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nperform, or have its Affiliate, Subcontractor, or Licensee (as the case may be) perform, incoming quality assurance testing on each shipment of Miltenyi Product in accordance with the Bellicum-approved quality control testing procedures as set forth in the Product Specifications or the Quality Agreement, as applicable (the Testing Methods), to verify conformance with the Product Specifications. For the avoidance of doubt, Bellicum shall have no obligation under this Section 7.1 to inspect or test the contents of the Miltenyi Products other than as in accordance with the agreed Testing Methods, save as prescribed by Applicable Laws.\n\n7.2 Rejection. Bellicum or its designee shall have the right to reject any shipment of Miltenyi Products that does not conform with the applicable Miltenyi Product Warranty at the time of Delivery when tested in accordance with the Testing Methods (each, a Rejected Product). Except in the case of latent defects as described in Section 7.3, each shipment of Miltenyi Products shall be deemed accepted by Bellicum if Bellicum or its designated recipient of the shipment does not provide Miltenyi with written notice of rejection (a Rejection Notice) within [...***...] days from the date of receipt of the relevant shipment of Miltenyi Product, describing the reasons for the rejection and the non-conforming characteristics of such Rejected Product in reasonable detail. Once a Delivery of Miltenyi Products is accepted or deemed accepted hereunder, Bellicum shall have no recourse against Miltenyi in the event any such Miltenyi Product is subsequently deemed unsuitable for use for any reason, except for Miltenyi Product that does not conform to the Miltenyi Product Warranty after said 30-day period due to a latent defect in the Miltenyi Product that could not be detected through the performance of the Testing Methods.\n\n7.3 Latent Defects. Bellicum shall have the further right to reject such quantities of Miltenyi Product accepted or deemed accepted pursuant to Section 7.2 above by providing a Rejection Notice on the grounds that all or part of the shipment fails to comply with the Miltenyi Product Warranty to the extent such non-conformance could not have reasonably been determined by visual inspection or incoming quality assurance testing in accordance with Section 7.1, provided that the applicable shelf-life of the Miltenyi Product has not expired and such non-conformance is unrelated to the shipping or storage of the Miltenyi Product after Delivery. The rejection provisions of Section 7.2 above shall apply. Notification to Miltenyi by Bellicum must occur within [...***...] days after Bellicum or Bellicum's designated recipient of the shipment becomes aware or reasonably should have become aware that the Miltenyi Product fails to comply with the Miltenyi Product Warranty.\n\n7.4 Confirmation. After its receipt of a Rejection Notice from Bellicum or its designee pursuant to Section 7.2, Miltenyi shall notify Bellicum in writing as soon as reasonably practical whether or not it accepts Bellicum's basis for rejection, and Bellicum shall reasonably cooperate with Miltenyi in determining in good faith whether such rejection was necessary or justified. Upon Miltenyi's reasonable request, Bellicum shall provide, or cause its designees to provide, (i) evidence of appropriate transport, storage and handling for any Rejected Product in accordance with the storage and handling instructions set forth in the applicable Product Specifications; and (ii) reasonable testing data demonstrating that the Miltenyi Product in question does not conform to the Miltenyi Product Warranty. If the Parties are unable to agree as to whether a shipment of Miltenyi Products supplied by Miltenyi hereunder conforms to the applicable Miltenyi Product Warranty, such question shall be submitted to an independent quality control laboratory mutually agreed upon by the Parties. The findings of such independent quality control laboratory shall be binding upon the Parties. The cost of the independent quality control laboratory shall be borne by the Party whose results are shown by such laboratory to have been incorrect.\n\n7.5 Return or Destruction of Rejected Products. Bellicum may not return or destroy any batch of Miltenyi Products until it receives written notification from Miltenyi that Miltenyi does not dispute that such batch fails to conform to the applicable Miltenyi Product Warranty. Miltenyi will indicate in its notice either that Bellicum is authorized to destroy the rejected batch of Miltenyi Products, or that Miltenyi requires return of the rejected Miltenyi Products. Upon written authorization from Miltenyi to do so, Bellicum shall promptly destroy the rejected batch of Miltenyi Products and provide Miltenyi with written certification of\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nsuch destruction. Upon receipt of Miltenyi's request for return, Bellicum shall promptly return the rejected batch of Miltenyi Products to Miltenyi. In each case, Miltenyi will reimburse Bellicum for the documented, reasonable costs associated with the destruction or return of the rejected Miltenyi Products.\n\n7.6 Replacement or Refund. Bellicum shall not be required to pay any invoice with respect to any shipment of Miltenyi Products properly rejected pursuant to this Section 7.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Bellicum shall be obligated to pay in full for any rejected shipment of Miltenyi Products that is not returned or destroyed in accordance with Section 7.5 above, and that is subsequently determined to conform to the applicable Miltenyi Product Warranty, irrespective of whether Bellicum has already paid Miltenyi for a replacement shipment (but in such event, the replacement shipment will be Delivered to Bellicum and will be included in Bellicum's Minimum Purchases). If Bellicum pays in full for a shipment of Miltenyi Products and subsequently properly rejects such shipment in accordance with Section 7.2, Bellicum shall be entitled, upon confirmation that such shipment failed to conform to the applicable Miltenyi Product Warranty, either, at Bellicum's option: (i) to a refund or credit equal to the Product Price paid with respect to such rejected shipment (including without limitation, taxes paid and shipping expenses); or (ii) to require Miltenyi to promptly replace and Deliver to Bellicum an amount of Miltenyi Products that conforms to the requirements of this Agreement at no additional cost to Bellicum. Bellicum acknowledges and agrees that Bellicum's rights to a refund or credit for, or to receive replacement of, properly rejected shipments of Miltenyi Products hereunder shall be Bellicum's sole and exclusive remedy, and Miltenyi's sole obligation, with respect to non-conforming Miltenyi Products delivered hereunder.\n\n7.7 Exceptions. Bellicum's rights of rejection, return, refund and replacement set forth in this Article 7 shall not apply to any Miltenyi Product that is non-conforming due to damage (i) caused by Bellicum, its Affiliates, Subcontractors, or Licensees or their respective employees or agents, including but not limited to, misuse, neglect, improper storage, transportation or use beyond any dating provided, or (ii) that occurs after Delivery of such Miltenyi Product in accordance with this Agreement, including any damage caused thereafter by accident, fire or other hazard, and Miltenyi shall have no liability or responsibility to Bellicum with respect thereto.\n\nARTICLE 8 FINANCIAL TERMS\n\n8.1 Upfront Payment. Following execution of this Agreement and within [...***...] days of Bellicum's receipt of an invoice therefor, and as consideration for (i) the right to use certain Miltenyi Products for human use, including the right to cross-reference to the Master File(s) and Miltenyi's additional filings in connection with such Master File(s) as described in Article 4; (ii) Miltenyi's obligation to supply certain Miltenyi Products for human clinical trials and commercialized human use; and (iii) Miltenyi's support of Bellicum's development and commercialization efforts regarding Bellicum Products, Bellicum will pay to Miltenyi a non-refundable upfront fee in the aggregate amount of two million Euro (\u20ac2,000,000) (the Upfront Fee). The Upfront Fee will be paid in installments, as follows: (a) a first installment of [...***...] Euro (\u20ac[...***...]), to be invoiced by Miltenyi following execution of this Agreement; (b) a second installment of [...***...] Euro (\u20ac[...***...]), to be invoiced by Miltenyi following the first anniversary of the Effective Date.\n\n8.2 Milestone Payments. For each particular Bellicum Product, Bellicum will pay to Miltenyi [...***...], one-time only milestone payments of [...***...] Euro (\u20ac[...***...]) each, [...***...] milestone payment corresponding to [...***...], and [...***...] milestone payment corresponding to [...***...], or [...***...], whatever comes earlier, respectively, of such Bellicum Product, as set forth in such Bellicum Product's or Bellicum Program corresponding Module(s).\n\n8.3 Third Party Fees and Royalties. Bellicum will reimburse Miltenyi for Third Party royalties and/or license fees, if any, owed by Miltenyi under Third Party license agreements existing as of the Effective Date as set forth on Exhibit D solely to the extent Miltenyi's exercise of rights under such licenses is required\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nto supply Miltenyi Product to Bellicum under this Agreement for the Permitted Use; and further provided that amounts owed under such Third Party license agreements have not otherwise been passed through to Bellicum and are actually paid by Miltenyi to Miltenyi's licensor(s). Bellicum acknowledges that the potential volume of such Third Party royalties and/or license fees under applicable Third Party license agreements will be as set forth on Exhibit D, as updated from time to time by Miltenyi. If, during the Term of this Agreement, the Parties mutually agree to obtain additional Third Party licenses to enable the Permitted Use of Miltenyi Products by Bellicum, its Affiliates, Subcontractors, and/or Licensees under this Agreement, and such additional licenses give rise to Third Party royalties and/or license fees with respect to Bellicum's use of Miltenyi Products under this Agreement, then the Parties will negotiate in good faith which Party(ies) is/are responsible for payment of such Third Party royalties and/or license fees. Miltenyi, acting reasonably, reserves the right to defer the inclusion of additional Miltenyi Products in Exhibit B hereto until the Parties have reached agreement on this matter.\n\n8.4 Pricing\n\n(a) Product Price. In consideration of the supply and Delivery of Miltenyi Products under and in accordance with this Agreement, Miltenyi agrees to sell and Deliver and Bellicum agrees to purchase Miltenyi Products under and in accordance with this Agreement at the Purchase Price listed for each unit of a Miltenyi Product set forth on Exhibit E (the Product Price).\n\n(b) Tiered Pricing. Bellicum shall be entitled to a reduction of the Product Prices set forth in Exhibit F (collectively, the Discounts). The Discount, as applicable to a particular Miltenyi Product in a Calendar Year, shall be based on Bellicum's and its Subcontractors' and Licensees' consolidated volume purchases of such Miltenyi Product in a Calendar Year. Within the first Calendar Year, Miltenyi shall analyze Bellicum's and its Subcontractors' and Licensees' purchases of Miltenyi Products at the end of each Calendar Quarter; if such purchases for a particular Miltenyi Product exceed the volume threshold of the then applicable Discount (based on binding and firm Purchase Orders received by Miltenyi in that Calendar Quarter), then, in the following Calendar Quarter, for all Purchase Orders regarding such Miltenyi Product, the corresponding higher Discount level in accordance with the volume thresholds as defined in Exhibit F shall apply. Subject to Bellicum reaching the Minimum Purchase requirements in accordcance with Section 5.6 in a Calendar Year, for the subsequent Calandar Year, the Discount applicable for the first Discount volume threshold shall apply, beginning from the first Miltenyi Product ordered by Bellicum under this Agreement during such subsequent Calendar Year.\n\n(c) Purchase Price Adjustments. Miltenyi shall be entitled to modify the Purchase Price for any Miltenyi Product as set forth in Section 8.3(a) above and Exhibit E on or after the commencement of each Calendar Year during the Term after Contract Year 1 in accordance with this Section 8.4(c), provided that there shall not be more than one (1) Purchase Price increase with respect to the same Miltenyi Product in any given Contract Year during the Term. In case, after application of the applicable Discount, any Purchase Price increases [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) annually, then the Parties shall consult each other, negotiate in good faith and agree in writing upon an adaptation of the applicable Discount to stay within the capping of a [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) increase, except for cases when such Purchase Price increase is the result of a documented increase of more than [...***...] ([...***...]%) in the cost of any raw materials, packaging and/or other components used in the manufacture of Miltenyi Product and Miltenyi, at Bellicum's request, has provided reasonable documentation evidencing such changes in production costs. It is however expressly agreed between the Parties that the adjusted Purchase Price charged to Bellicum for Miltenyi Product supplied hereunder shall in no event exceed Miltenyi's then-current list prices for such Miltenyi Product as in effect in the country of destination or use of the applicable Miltenyi Product, as published from time to time in Miltenyi's applicable product catalogue.\n\n(d) Product Price Adjustments resulting from Changes. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the limitations on Product Price increases set forth in Section 8.3(c) above shall not apply to\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nProduct Price adjustments resulting from a Required Change or a Bellicum-Requested Change pursuant to Section 3.2(d) hereof.\n\n8.5 Payment Terms. The payment terms for all payments made by Bellicum for purchased Miltenyi Products shall be as follows:\n\n(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, all undisputed and properly due payments are payable within [...***...] days of Bellicum's receipt of each invoice corresponding to a shipment of Miltenyi Products by Miltenyi, such invoices to be issued by Miltenyi or the applicable Miltenyi Affiliate in the Forecast Territory.\n\n(b) Bellicum shall make all payments by wire transfer or electronic fund transfer in immediately available funds to an account designated by Miltenyi or its local Affiliate in the Forecast Territory, as applicable. All payments by Bellicum to Miltenyi or its Affiliate (as the case may be) under this Agreement shall be made in the local currency that applies to the Miltenyi company that is assigned to fulfill the respective Purchase Order for Miltenyi Products.\n\n(c) All sums payable by Bellicum under this Agreement are stated exclusive of sales tax and VAT.\n\n(d) Without prejudice to any other right or remedy available to Miltenyi, Miltenyi reserves the right to assess a late fee equal to [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) per month, or if lower, the maximum amount permitted by Applicable Law, on all undisputed and properly due amounts not paid by Bellicum when due. Bellicum acknowledges that failure by Bellicum to comply with its payment obligations in this Article 8 shall constitute a material breach.\n\n(e) Except as expressly provided herein, Bellicum shall not exercise any right of setoff, net-out or deduction, take any credit, or otherwise reduce the balance owed to Miltenyi with respect to any payments under this Agreement, unless the Parties otherwise agree or until Bellicum has obtained a final and non-appealable judgment against Miltenyi in the amount asserted by Bellicum.\n\n8.6 Taxes. All payments made under this Agreement shall be free and clear of any and all taxes, duties, levies, fees or other charges, except for withholding taxes. Each Party shall be entitled to deduct from its payment to the other Party under this Agreement the amount of any withholding taxes required to be withheld, to the extent paid to the appropriate governmental authority on behalf of the other Party (and not refunded or reimbursed). Each Party shall deliver to the other Party, upon request, proof of payment of all such withholding taxes. Each Party shall provide reasonable assistance to the other Party in seeking any benefits available to such Party with respect to government tax withholdings by any relevant law, regulation or double tax treaty.\n\n8.7 Right to Suspend. Without prejudice to any other right or remedy available to Miltenyi, Miltenyi shall have the right to suspend its performance under this Agreement if and to the extent Bellicum materially fails to perform its payment obligations under this Agreement and fails to cure such failure within five Business Days after confirmed receipt of a notice of breach from Miltenyi. For the avoidance of doubt, the failure by Bellicum to make timely payments of any material, undisputed amount that is properly due Miltenyi under this Agreement shall constitute a material failure of Bellicum to perform its payment obligations under this Agreement. Without prejudice to any other right or remedy available to Bellicum, Bellicum shall have the right to suspend payment under this Agreement if and to the extent Miltenyi materially fails to perform its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nARTICLE 9 INSPECTION\n\n9.1 Facility Audits. Upon commercially reasonable notice (to be provided not less than [...***...] days in advance) and during Miltenyi's normal business hours, but not more often than once every [...***...] months, except for cause, during the Term of this Agreement, Bellicum or Bellicum's Licensees duly authorized agents, representatives or designees may inspect those portions of Miltenyi's Facilities that are used to manufacture, store or conduct testing of Miltenyi Products to determine compliance with Agreed Standards, Applicable Laws and the applicable Quality Agreement. Such representatives shall comply with the applicable rules and regulations for workers at such Facilities and shall enter into reasonable confidentiality and non-use agreements if so requested by Miltenyi, as a representative of Bellicum or such Licensee (and not in an individual capacity). All audits shall be conducted in a manner that is intended to minimize disruption to the operations at such Facilities. Miltenyi shall promptly address and correct any deviations from Agreed Standards, Applicable Laws and/or the provisions of the applicable Quality Agreement identified in connection with such inspections.\n\n9.2 Exempt Documentation. Miltenyi reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to exempt certain documentation from such audit described in Section 9.1 if and to the extent this is reasonably required in order to protect Miltenyi's trade secrets in Miltenyi Technology and/or other Miltenyi Intellectual Property Rights or Third Party Intellectual Property rights. If such exemption will have a material impact on the scope of a representative's inspection, the Parties will discuss in good faith other means to provide sufficient information to such representative.\n\n9.3 Inspection by Regulatory Authority. Miltenyi shall permit inspections of the Miltenyi Facility by Regulatory Authorities and shall respond to any notices or requests for information by Regulatory Authorities for any import or export license, registration or pending registration for manufacturing of Miltenyi Products during the Term of the Agreement. Miltenyi shall permit representatives of any applicable Regulatory Authority to access, at any reasonable time during normal business hours, any and all relevant records and information, personnel and facilities. To the extent that a Regulatory Authority raises any quality issue during or following a Regulatory Authority inspection that would Bellicumbe reasonably likely to adversely affect the suitability of the Miltenyi Products for any Permitted Use, Miltenyi shall promptly advise Bellicum in writing of such issue. The Parties will promptly give written notice to each other in advance of any scheduled inspection of Miltenyi's Facility by a Regulatory Authority.\n\n9.4 Cost of Audits and Inspections. If Bellicum or or Bellicum's Licensees conduct a Facility audit or inspection more than [...***...] in a [...***...] month period, and such additional audits are not for cause audits, then Bellicum and its Licensees (as applicable) shall reimburse Miltenyi for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by Miltenyi as a direct result of Facility audits and/or inspections pursuant to Sections 9.1and 9.3 solely to the extent that they relate to the review of a Bellicum Product. For clarity, Bellicum shall not be liable, in any event, for any costs and expenses incurred by Miltenyi to correct deficiencies of Miltenyi manufacturing procedures in order to comply with: 1) Agreed Standards, Applicable Laws, the applicable Quality Agreement and Product Specifications; 2) inspection of a Miltenyi Product in general; and 3) inspection of a Third Party product.\n\nARTICLE 10 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\n\n10.1 Existing Intellectual Property. Except as the Parties may otherwise expressly agree in writing, each Party shall continue to own all rights, including all Intellectual Property Rights, in and title to its Technology existing as of the Effective Date or developed during the Term but outside the scope of this Agreement, without conferring any interests therein on the other Party. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, as between the Parties, the Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) Miltenyi owns and shall continue to own all rights (including all Intellectual Property Rights) in the Miltenyi Technology included in the Miltenyi Products supplied to Bellicum, and Bellicum shall not acquire any right, interest in or title to the Miltenyi Technology by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise, and (ii) Bellicum owns or\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\ncontrols and shall continue to own and control all rights (including all Intellectual Property Rights) in the Bellicum Technology and Bellicum Products (and any Intellectual Property rights thereof), and Miltenyi shall not acquire any right, interest in or title to the Bellicum Technology and Bellicum Products (and any Intellectual Property rights thereof) by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise.\n\n10.2 Limited License.

The foregoing license shall be sub-licensable through multiple tiers to Licensees of Bellicum and to Bellicum's and its Licensees' respective Subcontractors (but not to Miltenyi Competitors) solely in conjunction with the use of such Miltenyi Products for the Permitted Use, provided however that Subcontractors shall not have the right to grant sublicenses under Miltenyi Technology). For the avoidance of doubt, the license granted to Bellicum under this Section 10.2 conveys no right to Bellicum, its Subcontractors or Licensees to use Miltenyi Technology to make, have made, import, have imported, offer for sale and/or sell any Miltenyi Product.\n\n10.3 Notification. Miltenyi will promptly notify Bellicum in writing of Miltenyi's receipt of any written claim or demand from any Third Party alleging that the practice of Miltenyi Technology infringes such Third Party's Intellectual Property Rights, or Miltenyi's receipt of written notice of the initiation of any legal action or other legal proceeding by any Third Party alleging that the practice of Miltenyi Technology infringes such Third Party's Intellectual Property Rights.\n\n10.4 Disclaimer. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed or interpreted, either expressly or by implication, estoppel or otherwise, as: (i) a grant, transfer or other conveyance by either Party to the other of any right, title, license or other interest of any kind in any portion of its Technology or Intellectual Property Rights, or (ii) creating an obligation on the part of either Party to make any such grant, transfer or other conveyance.\n\nARTICLE 11 WARRANTIES\n\n11.1 Miltenyi Product Warranty.

If Miltenyi fails to negotiate such license or modify the applicable Miltenyi Product, and to the extent Bellicum reasonably determines, following consultation with Miltenyi, that it is obligated to take a royalty-bearing license under any Third Party Intellectual Property Rights in order to avoid infringement of such Third Party Intellectual Property Rights with respect to the use of the applicable Miltenyi Product, then Bellicum shall have the right to offset any payment actually made to the Third Party for such license in any Contract Year against any Product Price payable to Miltenyi for the applicable Miltenyi Product in the same\n\n33\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nContract Year (on a Miltenyi Product-by-Miltenyi Product basis), under the proviso that Bellicum provides Miltenyi with reasonably satisfactory evidence of such Third Party royalties payment. The total amount of any reduction(s) pursuant to this Section 11.5(b) shall in no event exceed [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) of the Product Price payable for the applicable Miltenyi Product in that Contract Year (with the right to carry forward any unused offset).\n\n(c) The foregoing shall be Bellicum's sole and exclusive remedy and Miltenyi's sole obligation with respect to claims that any Miltenyi Product fails to comply with the Miltenyi Product Warranty or the warranties in Section 11.2. Miltenyi will not in any event be liable for increased manufacturing costs, downtime costs, purchase of substitute products, lost profits, revenue, or goodwill, or any other indirect incidental, special, or consequential damages caused by a breach of the Miltenyi Product Warranty or the warranties in Section 11.2.\n\nARTICLE 12 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY\n\n12.1 Limitation of Liability.

IN NO ONE EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES OR LOSSES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF THE PRODUCT PRICES PAID BY BELLICUM FOR THE MILTENYI PRODUCT(S) DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY; AND FURTHER PROVIDED THAT SUCH AGGREGATE LIABILITY DURING SUCH PERIOD ALSO SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF SUCH PARTY'S INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR SUCH AGGREGATE LIABILITY.\n\n12.2 No Liability for Clinical Trials. Bellicum shall have sole responsibility that any Bellicum Product is safe for human use, and Bellicum hereby assumes sole risk and liability arising out of or in connection with the use of Bellicum Products in clinical trials by or on behalf of Bellicum or commercialization of Bellicum Products (including product liability with respect thereto).\n\nARTICLE 13 INDEMNIFICATION; INSURANCE\n\n13.1 Indemnification by Miltenyi.

In the event Bellicum seeks indemnification under this Section\n\n34\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\n13.1, Bellicum shall (a) notify Miltenyi in writing of such Third Party claim as soon as reasonably practicable after it receives notice of the claim, (b) provided that Miltenyi is not contesting the indemnity obligation, permit Miltenyi to assume direction and control of the defense of the claim (including the right to settle the claim solely for monetary consideration), provided further that Miltenyi shall act reasonably and in good faith with respect to all matters relating to the settlement or disposition of any claim as the settlement or disposition relates to parties being indemnified under this Section 13.1, and (c) cooperate as requested (at Miltenyi's expense) in the defense of the claim; but provided always that Miltenyi may not settle any such claim or otherwise consent to an adverse judgment or order in any relevant action or other proceeding or make any admission as to liability or fault without the prior express written permission of an authorized representative of Bellicum.\n\n13.2 Indemnification by Bellicum. Bellicum will save, defend and hold harmless Miltenyi, its Affiliates, Subcontractors, officers, directors, employees, consultants and agents (collectively, Miltenyi Indemnitees) from and against any and all Losses to which any such Miltenyi Indemnitee may become subject as a result of any claim, demand, action or other proceeding by any Third Party to the extent such Losses arise out of: (i) the material breach by Bellicum of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by it under this Agreement; (ii) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any Bellicum Indemnitee (as defined above); or (iii) the development, manufacture, use, handling, storage, sale or other disposition of any Bellicum Product by or on behalf of Bellicum; except, in each case, to the extent such Losses result from the material breach by Miltenyi of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by it under this Agreement or the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any Miltenyi Indemnitee. In the event Miltenyi seeks indemnification under this Section 13.2, Miltenyi shall (a) notify Bellicum in writing of such Third Party claim as soon as reasonably practicable after it receives notice of the claim, (b) provided that Bellicum is not contesting the indemnity obligation, permit Bellicum to assume direction and control of the defense of the claim (including the right to settle the claim solely for monetary consideration), provided further that Bellicum shall act reasonably and in good faith with respect to all matters relating to the settlement or disposition of any claim as the settlement or disposition relates to parties being indemnified under this Section 13.2, and (c) cooperate as requested (at Bellicum's expense) in the defense of the claim; but provided always that Bellicum may not settle any such claim or otherwise consent to an adverse judgment or order in any relevant action or other proceeding or make any admission as to liability or fault without the prior express written permission of Miltenyi.\n\n13.3 Survival of Indemnification Obligations. The provisions of this Article 13 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever.\n\n13.4 Insurance. Each Party will maintain at its sole cost and expense, an adequate amount of commercial general liability and product liability insurance throughout the Term and for a period of five (5) years thereafter, to protect against potential liabilities and risk arising out of products supplied or activities to be performed under this Agreement and any Quality Agreement related hereto upon such terms (including coverages, deductible limits and self-insured retentions) as are customary in the industry for the products supplied or activities to be conducted by such Party under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, such Bellicum liability insurance or self-insurance program will insure against personal injury, physical injury or property damage arising out of the pre-clinical, clinical and commercial manufacture, sale, use, distribution or marketing of Bellicum Product, and such Miltenyi liability insurance or self-insurance program will insure against personal injury, physical injury or property damage arising out of use of a Miltenyi Product in the manufacture of a Bellicum Product. In addition, from time to time during the Term, each Party shall increase their levels of insurance coverage if reasonably deemed prudent by such Party in light of the overall products supplied and/or activities performed under this Agreement. Each Party shall provide the other Party with written proof of the existence of such insurance upon reasonable written request.\n\n35\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nARTICLE 14 CONFIDENTIALITY\n\n14.1 Definition. As used in this Agreement, the term Confidential Information means any information disclosed by one Party (the Disclosing Party) to the other Party (the Receiving Party) pursuant to this Agreement which is (a) in written, graphic, machine readable or other tangible form and is marked Confidential, Proprietary or in some other manner to indicate its confidential nature, or (b) oral information disclosed pursuant to this Agreement, provided that such information is designated as confidential at the time of disclosure and reduced to a written summary by the Disclosing Party, within thirty (30) calendar days after its oral disclosure, which is marked in a manner to indicate its confidential nature and delivered to the Receiving Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Disclosing Party's failure to so mark any of its Confidential Information, whether disclosed in written, graphic, machine readable or other tangible form, or its failure to designate as confidential and reduce to writing any Confidential Information disclosed orally, shall not relieve the Receiving Party of its obligations hereunder with respect to such Confidential Information if its confidential nature would be apparent to a reasonable person in the biotechnology or biopharmaceutical industry, based on the subject matter of such Confidential Information or the circumstances under which it is disclosed.\n\n14.2 Non-Disclosure and Non-Use. During the Term and for five (5) years thereafter, each of Miltenyi and Bellicum shall keep Confidential Information of the other Party in strict confidence and shall not (i) use the other Party's Confidential Information for any use or purpose except as expressly permitted under this Agreement, the Quality Agreement or as otherwise authorized in writing in advance by the other Party, or (ii) disclose the other Party's Confidential Information to anyone other than those of its Affiliates, Subcontractors, directors, officers, employees, agents, contractors, collaborators and consultants, and in the case of Bellicum, its Licensees (collectively, Authorized Representatives) who need to know such Confidential Information for a use or purpose expressly permitted under this Agreement. Each Receiving Party shall take reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party. Without limiting the foregoing, each Receiving Party shall take at least those measures that it takes to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature (but not less than reasonable measures) and shall ensure that any Authorized Representative of the Receiving Party who is permitted access to Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party pursuant to clause (ii) in the first sentence of this Section 14.2 is contractually or legally bound by obligations of non-disclosure and non-use in scope and content at least as protective of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information as the provisions hereof prior to any disclosure of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information to such Authorized Representative. The Receiving Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its Authorized Representatives.\n\n14.3 Exceptions. Notwithstanding the above, a Receiving Party shall have no obligations under this Article 14 with regard to any information of the Disclosing Party which the Receiving Party can demonstrate through competent proof: (a) was generally known and available in the public domain at the time it was disclosed to the Receiving Party or becomes generally known and available in the public domain through no act or omission of the Receiving Party or its Authorized Representatives; (b) can be documented as previously known by the Receiving Party prior to disclosure thereof by the Disclosing Party; (c) is disclosed with the prior written approval of the Disclosing Party; (d) was independently developed by the Receiving Party without any use of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information; or (e) becomes known to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Disclosing Party without breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party; provided (i) only the specific information that meets the exclusions shall be excluded, and not any other information that happens to appear in proximity to such excluded portions (for example, a portion of a document may be excluded without affecting the confidential nature of those portions that do not themselves qualify for exclusion) or that happens to be disclosed at the same time or in connection therewith; and (ii) specific Confidential Information shall not be deemed to be known, disclosed, in the public domain nor in Receiving Party's possession merely because of broader or related information being known, disclosed, in the public domain or in Receiving Party's possession, nor\n\n36\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nshall combinations of elements or principles be considered to be known, disclosed, in the public domain nor in Receiving Party's possession merely because individual elements thereof are known, disclosed, in the public domain or in Receiving Party's possession.\n\n14.4 Permitted Disclosure.\n\n(a) Compelled Disclosure. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article 14, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Receiving Party from disclosing Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent the Receiving Party is legally required or compelled to do so by any governmental investigative or judicial agency or body pursuant to proceedings over which such agency or body has jurisdiction; provided, however, that prior to making any such required or compelled disclosure, the Receiving Party shall: (i) assert the confidential nature of the Confidential Information to such agency or body; (ii) promptly notify the Disclosing Party in writing of such order or requirement to disclose; and (iii) cooperate fully with the Disclosing Party in protecting against or limiting any such disclosure and/or obtaining a protective order, confidential treatment and/or any other remedy narrowing the scope of the required or compelled disclosure and protecting its confidentiality. In the event that a protective order, confidential treatment and/or other remedy is not obtained, or if the Disclosing Party waives compliance with the provisions of this Agreement as applied to such required or compelled disclosure, then the Receiving Party may, without liability, disclose the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information to the extent that it is legally required or compelled to disclose. The Receiving Party will furnish only that portion of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information that is legally required to disclose and will make all reasonable and diligent efforts to obtain reliable assurances that confidential treatment will be afforded to Confidential Information so disclosed. Disclosure of Confidential Information pursuant to this Section 14.4(a) shall not alter the character of that information as Confidential Information hereunder.\n\n(b) Authorized Disclosure. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article 14, each Party may disclose the terms of this Agreement (i) in connection with the requirements of an initial public offering or securities filing; (ii) in confidence, to accountants, attorneys, other professional advisors, banks, and financing sources and their advisors; (iii) in confidence, in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement or rights under this Agreement; or (iv) in confidence, in connection with a merger or acquisition or proposed merger or acquisition, or a sale or proposed sale of its assets or business, or the like.\n\n14.5 Publicity. Each Party may disclose the existence of this Agreement, but agrees that the terms and conditions of this Agreement will be treated as Confidential Information of the other Party. Except as otherwise required by Applicable Laws or regulations, neither Party shall make any public announcement or press release regarding this Agreement or any terms thereof, or otherwise use the name, logos, trademarks or products of the other Party in any publication, without the other Party's express prior written consent.\n\n14.6 Remedies. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the provisions of this Article 14 are necessary for the protection of the business and goodwill of the Parties and are considered by the Parties to be reasonable for such purpose. Each Party agrees that any violation of this Article 14 by it or its Affiliate, or Subcontractors may cause substantial and irreparable harm to the other Party and, therefore, in the event of any violation or threatened violation of this Article 14 by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek specific performance and other injunctive and equitable relief in addition to any other legal remedies available.\n\nARTICLE 15 TERM AND TERMINATION\n\n15.1 Term. This Agreement shall enter into force on the Effective Date. The Agreement shall have an initial term of ten (10) years commencing from the Effective Date and ending on the tenth (10th) anniversary thereof (the Initial Term), unless earlier terminated by either Party in accordance with the provisions of Section 15.2 or Section 15.3. Thereafter, Bellicum shall have consecutive separate options to extend the Term for successive renewal terms of five (5) years each (each, a Renewal Term, and\n\n37\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\ncollectively with the Initial Term, the Term).

Bellicum may terminate this Agreement or a particular Module upon ninety (90) days written notice to Miltenyi: 1) if Bellicum, in its sole and absolute discretion, discontinues or indefinitely suspends the development and/or commercialization of the Bellicum Product(s) or 2) without cause for any reason or no reason. Upon the termination of this Agreement or such Module pursuant to this Section 15.3, Bellicum's sole obligation shall be for it to make payment of all undisputed and properly due amounts payable for Miltenyi Product ordered prior to the effective date of such termination of each terminated Module, including any Purchase Order to be made by Bellicum in connection with Bellicum's then- outstanding obligation to purchase quantities of Miltenyi Product forecasted with respect to an applicable Firm Zone. For clarity, termination of this Agreement or any Module pursuant to this Section 15.3 shall not release Bellicum from its payment obligations with respect to the quantities set forth in any Purchase Orders or quantities forecasted for any Firm Zone.\n\n15.4 Expiration or termination of this Agreement or a particular Module for any reason shall not release either Party from liability accrued under this Agreement or such Module, respectively, prior to such expiration or termination, nor preclude either Party from pursuing any rights or remedies accrued prior to such expiration or termination or accrued at law or in equity with respect to any uncured material breach of this Agreement or such Module.\n\n15.5 The termination of this Agreement or a particular Module shall not operate to relieve Bellicum from its obligation to pay undisputed and properly due amounts of (a) the Product Price of all\n\n38\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nquantities of Miltenyi Products (i) delivered in accordance with this Agreement, such Module(s) and the applicable Quality Agreement up to the effective date of termination and (ii) to be delivered under outstanding Purchase Orders accepted by Miltenyi prior to the date of notice of termination (including the Ordered Quantities) or (iii) forecasted for any Firm Zone in the most recent applicable Monthly Forecast; (b) any Upfront Fee payable under Section 8.1 and any earned Milestone Fee payable under Section 8.2 hereof; and (c) all other undisputed and properly due fees and/or expenses owed to Miltenyi in accordance with this Agreement, such Module(s) and the applicable Quality Agreement prior to the date of notice of termination; provided, however, that in the event of termination of this Agreement or such Module(s) by Bellicum pursuant to Section 15.2 (Termination for Cause), Bellicum shall not be responsible for payments relating to any portion of the Forecast applicable to any period after the effective date of termination. All amounts paid under Sections 8.1 through 8.3 shall be non-refundable once paid.\n\n15.6 Post Termination. Upon the termination or expiry of this Agreement, each Party shall promptly return to the other Party or destroy, at the other Party's request,\n\n(a) any and all Confidential Information of the other Party then in its possession or control, except if such information is covered under surviving license rights, and further provided that each Party may keep one (1) copy of such information in its legal archives for regulatory compliance purposes and in order to determine its ongoing obligations hereunder, including in connection with legal proceedings; and such additional copies of or any computer records or files containing such Confidential Information that have been created solely by the Receiving Party's automatic archiving and back-up procedures, to the extent created and retained in a manner consistent with the Receiving Party's standard archiving and back-up procedures, but not for any other use or purpose; and\n\n(b) any and all remaining materials and capital equipment of the other Party then in its possession or control.\n\n15.7 Survival. Other than obligations which have accrued and are outstanding as of the date of any expiration or termination of this Agreement, and except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or the Quality Agreement or as otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties in writing, all rights granted and obligations undertaken by the Parties hereunder shall terminate immediately upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement, subject to Section 15.4 above and except for the following which shall survive according to their terms: Section 2.2 (Permitted Use); Section 2.7 (Subcontracting by Bellicum); Article 10 (Intellectual Property); Article 11 (Warranty); Article 12 (Limitation of Liability); Article 13 (Indemnification; Insurance); Article 14 (Confidentiality and Non-disclosure); Section 15.7 (Post-termination); Section 15.7 (Survival); Article 16 (Notices); Article 17 (Assignment); Article 19 (Dispute Resolution and Applicable Law); and Article 20 (Miscellaneous); and any and all rights and obligations of the Parties thereunder, as well as any other provision hereunder which by its nature is intended to survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\nARTICLE 16 NOTICES.\n\nAll notices, demands, requests, consents, approval and other communications required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and will be delivered personally, or mailed by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or sent by reputable overnight courier service, confirmed by mailing as described above at the address set forth below or to such other address as any Party may give to the other Party in writing for such purpose in accordance with this Article 16:\n\n39\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nIf to Miltenyi: Miltenyi Biotec GmbH  Friedrich-Ebert-Str. 68  51429 Bergisch Gladbach  Germany  Attn: Managing Director  Fax: [...***...]\n\nWith copy to (for legal matters):  Miltenyi Biotec GmbH  Friedrich-Ebert-Str. 68  51429 Bergisch Gladbach  Germany  Attn: General Counsel  Fax: [...***...]\n\nIf to Bellicum Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

In addition, either Party shall have the right to assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement to an Affiliate upon written notice to the non-assigning Party; provided, however, the assigning or transferring Party shall continue to remain liable\n\n40\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nfor the performance of this Agreement by such Affiliate. Upon any such assignment, all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement binding upon, or inuring to the benefit of, the assigning Party shall be binding on, and inure to the benefit of, its assignee, whether so expressed in the assignment or not. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit Miltenyi or any of its Affiliates from granting a security interest in this Agreement and any rights hereunder to any Third Party in connection with any financing transaction to the extent provided under (and subject to the restrictions on the rights of secured parties contained in) Applicable Laws. In addition, Miltenyi or any Affiliate of Miltenyi shall have the right to sell, assign, pledge or otherwise transfer any accounts and payment intangibles in connection with any financing transaction. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of each Party, its successors and permitted assigns. Any assignment of this Agreement in contravention of this Article 17 shall be null and void.\n\nARTICLE 18 FORCE MAJEURE\n\n18.1 Neither Party will be liable to the other Party on account of any loss or damage resulting from any delay or failure to perform all or any part of this Agreement if such delay or failure is caused, in whole or in part, by events, occurrences, or causes beyond the reasonable control and without negligence of the Parties (Force Majeure Event). Such events, occurrences, or causes will include acts of God, strikes, lockouts, acts of war, riots, civil commotion, terrorist acts, epidemic, failure or default of public utilities or common carriers, destruction of facilities or materials by fire, explosion, earthquake, storm or the like catastrophe, and failure of plant or machinery (provided that such failure could not have been prevented by the exercise of skill, diligence and prudence that would be reasonably and ordinarily expected from a skilled and experienced person engaged in the same type of undertaking under the same or similar circumstances), but the inability to meet financial obligations is expressly excluded.\n\n18.2 The Party affected by a Force Majeure Event shall inform promptly the other Party in writing of the Force Majeure Event's occurrence, anticipated duration and cessation. The Party giving such notice shall thereupon be excused from such of its obligations hereunder as it is thereby disabled from performing for so long as it is so disabled, provided, however, that such affected Party commences and continues to take reasonable and diligent actions to cure such cause.\n\nARTICLE 19 APPLICABLE LAWS; JURISDICTION\n\n19.1 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, USA, without regard to the conflict of law provisions thereof or the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods; provided, however, that any dispute relating to the scope, validity, enforceability or infringement of any Intellectual Property Right will be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the substantive laws of the jurisdiction in which such Intellectual Property Right applies.\n\n19.2 Dispute Resolution Procedures. Should any dispute, claim or controversy arise between the Parties relating to the validity, interpretation, existence, performance, termination or breach of this Agreement (collectively, a Dispute), the Parties shall use their best efforts to resolve the Dispute by good faith negotiations, first between their respective representatives directly involved in that Dispute and the Alliance Managers for a period of thirty (30) days, and then, if necessary, between vice presidents of the Parties for an additional fifteen (15) days, and then, if necessary, between Chief Executive Officers of the Parties for an additional five (5) Business Days. Any such Dispute not satisfactorily settled by negotiation in accordance with the foregoing process, either Party may submit such Dispute to a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with subsection (a) below; provided that nothing in this Section 19.2 will preclude either Party from seeking injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with Section (a) below.\n\n(a) Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Venue. Each Party hereto agrees that any action, proceeding or claim it commences against the other Party pursuant to this Agreement shall be brought\n\n41\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\nin the courts of the United States for the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment. Each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the jurisdiction of the State of New York Courts and irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court, any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum and the right to object, with respect to any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court, that such court does not have jurisdiction over such Party. Each Party agrees that a final non-appealable judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding in such a court shall be conclusive and binding and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Applicable Law.\n\n(b) Waiver of Jury Trial. Due to the high costs and time involved in commercial litigation before a jury, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ANY AND ALL ISSUES IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n19.3 Injunctive Relief. Each Party acknowledges that its breach of its obligations under this Agreement may result in immediate and irreparable harm to the other Party, for which there may be no adequate remedy at law. Therefore, in the event of a breach or threatened breach, the non-breaching Party may, in addition to other remedies, immediately seek from any court of competent jurisdiction injunctive relief (including a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction or other interim equitable relief) prohibiting the breach or threatened breach or compelling specific performance, without the necessity of proving actual damages. Such right to injunctive relief as provided for in this paragraph is in addition to, and is not in limitation of, whatever remedies either Party may be entitled to as a matter of law or equity, including money damages. The Parties agree to waive the requirement of posting a bond in connection with a court's issuance of an injunction.\n\nARTICLE 20 MISCELLANEOUS\n\n20.1 Governing Further Actions. Each Party will execute, acknowledge and deliver such further instruments, and do all such other acts, as may be necessary or appropriate in order to carry out the purposes and intent of the Agreement.\n\n20.2 Independent Contractors. The relationship between Miltenyi and Bellicum created by this Agreement is one of independent contractors. Neither Party shall have the power or authority to bind or obligate the other Party, or purport to take on any obligation or responsibility, or make any representations, warranties, guarantees or endorsements to anyone, on behalf of the other Party, except as expressly permitted in this Agreement.\n\n20.3 Entire Agreement and Amendment. This Agreement (including all Exhibits attached hereto, which are incorporated herein by reference, and as amended from time to time in accordance with the provisions hereof) and any Quality Agreement(s) sets forth all of the covenants, promises, agreements, warranties, representations, conditions and understandings between the Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, and constitutes and contains the complete, final, and exclusive understanding and agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and cancels, supersedes and terminates all prior agreements and understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. There are no covenants, promises, agreements, warranties, representations conditions or understandings, whether oral or written, between the Parties other than as set forth herein or in a Quality Agreement. No subsequent alteration, amendment, change or addition to this Agreement (including all Exhibits attached hereto) shall be binding upon the Parties hereto unless reduced to writing and signed by the respective authorized officers of the Parties.\n\n42\n\n\n\n\n\nMiltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)\n\n20.4 Severability and Headings. If any term, condition or provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, unlawful or unenforceable to any extent by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the Parties will negotiate in good faith a substitute, valid and enforceable provision that most nearly effects the Parties' intent and the Parties agree to be bound by the mutually agreed substitute provision. If the Parties fail to agree on such an amendment, such invalid term, condition or provision will be severed from the remaining terms, conditions and provisions, which will continue to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. Headings used in this Agreement are provided for convenience only, and shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.\n\n20.5 No Waiver. Any waiver of the provisions of this Agreement or of a Party's rights or remedies under this Agreement must be in writing to be effective. Failure, neglect or delay by a Party to enforce the provisions of this Agreement or its rights or remedies at any time, will not be construed as a waiver of such Party's rights under this Agreement and will not in any way affect the validity of the whole or any part of this Agreement or prejudice such Party's right to take subsequent action. No exercise or enforcement by either Party of any right or remedy under this Agreement will preclude the enforcement by such Party of any other right or remedy under this Agreement or that such Party is entitled by law to enforce.\n\n20.6 Negotiated Terms. The Parties agree that the terms and conditions of this Agreement are the result of negotiations between the Parties and that this Agreement shall not be construed in favor of or against any Party by reason of the extent to which any Party or its professional advisors participated in the preparation of this Agreement.\n\n20.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which need not contain the signature of more than one Party but all such counterparts taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement, and may be executed through exchange of original signatures or electronic copies (PDF).\n\n[Remainder of this page intentionally left blank.

Grant of License by Certegy.\n\n     (a) Certegy hereby grants, and will cause the other members of the Certegy Group to grant, to Equifax a fully paid, non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide, non-transferable license to use, modify, copy, improve, create Derivative Works and Equifax Enhancements from, and sublicense the Licensed Certegy Materials (excluding the Utility Software Programs) solely for use in the Equifax Business and as that business may evolve and change in the future, subject to the following:\n\n          (i)   Equifax shall not sublicense, or otherwise disclose or                 distribute, or permit any Person to use, the Licensed Certegy                 Materials (excluding the Utility Software Programs), except in                 accordance with Section 4.4(b);\n\n          (ii)  Equifax shall hold the Licensed Certegy Materials (excluding the                 Utility Software Programs) in strict confidence; will not remove                 or destroy any proprietary markings of the Certegy Group on or                 contained in the Licensed Certegy Materials (excluding the\n\n\n\n\n\n                Utility Software Programs); and will include the copyright and                 patent notices of the licensor as specified from time to time by                 the licensor for the Licensed Certegy Materials (excluding the                 Utility Software Programs) on and in all copies of the Licensed                 Certegy Materials (excluding the Utility Software Programs);\n\n          (iii) Equifax shall not export or re-export the Licensed Certegy                 Materials (excluding the Utility Software Programs) without the                 appropriate United States or foreign government license; and\n\n          (iv)  all sublicenses from Equifax to members of the Equifax Group (A)                 shall contain the rights and restrictions set forth in this                 Section 4.4(a) with respect to the license granted to Equifax                 and comply with Sections 4.4(b) through (d) hereof and (B) shall                 be diligently enforced by Equifax.\n\n     (b) The sublicense rights granted to Equifax pursuant to Section 4.4(a) include the right for Equifax to grant sublicenses to the Licensed Certegy Materials (excluding the Utility\n\n                                       15\n\nSoftware Programs) to the members of the Equifax Group, which sublicenses may include the right to further sublicense such Licensed Certegy Materials (excluding the Utility Software Programs) to such Group member's customers solely for each such customer's internal business purposes to the extent related to the Equifax Business. All sublicensing by Equifax and other members of the Equifax Group to any one of their customers shall be pursuant to written agreements with such customer, executed before or at the time of furnishing each copy of the Licensed Certegy Materials (excluding the Utility Software Programs) to such customer, and which provide at a minimum that such customer:\n\n          (i)   receives only a personal, non-transferable and nonexclusive                 right to use such copy of the Licensed Certegy Materials                 (excluding the Utility Software Programs);\n\n          (ii)  receives no title in the intellectual property contained in the                 Licensed Certegy Materials (excluding the Utility Software                 Programs);\n\n          (iii) will not copy the Licensed Certegy Materials (excluding the                 Utility Software Programs), except as necessary to use such                 Licensed Certegy Materials (excluding the Utility Software                 Programs) in accordance with the license grant and to make one                 archival copy;\n\n          (iv)  will not export or re-export the Licensed Certegy Materials                 (excluding the Utility Software Programs) without the                 appropriate United States or foreign government licenses;\n\n          (v)   will hold the Licensed Certegy Materials (excluding the Utility                 Software Programs) in confidence; will not reverse compile or                 disassemble the Licensed Certegy Materials (excluding the                 Utility Software Programs); will not remove or destroy any                 proprietary markings of the licensor on or contained in the                 Licensed Certegy Materials (excluding the Utility Software                 Programs); and will include the copyright and patent notices of                 the licensor as specified from time to time by the licensor for                 the Licensed Certegy Materials (excluding the Utility Software                 Programs) on and in all copies of the Licensed Certegy Materials                 (excluding the Utility Software Programs); and\n\n          (vi)  will not sublicense, assign or otherwise transfer the Licensed                 Certegy Materials (excluding the Utility Software Programs) to                 any other Person.\n\n     (c) In the event any member of the Equifax Group sublicenses any portion of the Licensed Certegy Materials (excluding the Utility Software Programs) to any third party pursuant to Section 4.4(a) and (b) above, Equifax agrees to ensure that such member shall diligently enforce the terms and conditions of all sublicenses granted pursuant to this Section 4.4.\n\n                                       16\n\n     (d) In the event that Equifax, or another member of the Equifax Group, shall enter into a Divested Business transaction with respect to the Equifax Group, and the scope of permitted use or other terms applicable to the Licensed Certegy Materials (excluding the Utility Software Programs) under the license or sublicenses granted in this Section 4.4 are required to be modified to effect such transaction, Certegy will, or will cause the sublicensor under the applicable sublicense to, agree to such modifications to the extent (i) required for the transaction to be effected and (ii) not materially detrimental to the interests of the Certegy Group. Such modifications shall not be effective until the Divested Business or the acquiror thereof, as required by Certegy, has entered into a license agreement with the appropriate member of the Certegy Group incorporating the terms of Section 4.4 and Section 4.5 and such other terms as Certegy reasonably deems appropriate for the protection of its interests in the Licensed Certegy Materials.\n\n     (e) Without limiting the foregoing, Certegy hereby grants, and will cause\n\n\n\n\n\nthe other members of the Certegy Group to grant, to Equifax a fully paid, non- exclusive, perpetual, worldwide, transferable license to use, modify, improve, create Derivative Works from, and sublicense, the Utility Software Programs (in both object and source code format) identified on Exhibit L as being owned by Certegy or a member of the Certegy Group for any and all fields of use and to any and all Persons.\n\n     (f) The Licensed Certegy Materials may be marketed under such name and in such manner as Equifax chooses, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\n\n     (g) Except for the Equifax Group's rights described in Section 4.4(a), (b) and (e) above, the Certegy Group's rights in and to the Licensed Certegy Materials shall be and remain the exclusive property of Certegy or the respective Designated Certegy Member.\n\n     Section 4.5. Ownership of Enhancements by Equifax.\n\n     (a) Unless Exhibit K provides otherwise, Equifax, or the respective Designated Equifax Member, shall own all the modifications and improvements to, and the Equifax Enhancements and/or Derivative Works made from, the Licensed Certegy Materials developed by any member of the Equifax Group, or by any party other than a member of the Certegy Group at the expense of the Equifax Group. Certegy hereby assigns, and shall cause each member of the Certegy Group to assign, to Equifax, or the respective Designated Equifax Member, all right, title and interest it may hold in and to such modifications, improvements, Equifax Enhancements and Derivative Works. Equifax shall, or shall cause the respective Designated Equifax Member to, have the right to make and file all applications and other documents required to register the copyright(s) and file for patents for such modifications, improvements, Equifax Enhancements and Derivative Works in its discretion and at its sole cost and expense.\n\n     (b) Should Equifax elect to file any application for the registration, perfection or protection of any modifications, improvements, Equifax Enhancements or Derivative Works described in Section 4.5(a), under any copyright, patent or other law of any country or jurisdiction, Certegy will, at the request and expense of Equifax, do all things and sign all documents or instruments reasonably necessary in the opinion of Equifax to assist in the\n\n                                       17\n\nregistration of such claims, file such applications, and obtain, defend and enforce such copyright, patent, mask work and other rights.\n\n     (c) Subject to the license rights granted in Section 4.4, as between the parties, the Licensed Certegy Materials shall be and shall remain the sole and exclusive property of the Certegy Group and the members of the Certegy Group may make any internal use and may commercially exploit any enhancements to the Licensed Materials made or caused to be made by members of the Equifax Group, as they shall deem appropriate without any obligation to any member of the Equifax Group or other restriction. The Certegy Group may in particular distribute and manufacture, or cause to be manufactured or distributed by any third party, any such enhancements and/or Licensed Certegy Materials.\n\n     Section 4.6. Data.\n\n     In no event shall any member of either Group be deemed to have been granted any rights under this Agreement in or to any data owned or maintained by any other member of the other Group, except as specifically provided in Sections 2.1 or 2.2. The respective rights of the members of each Group in and to such data shall be governed exclusively by Sections 2.1 or 2.2 and the Intercompany Data Purchase Agreement.\n\n     Section 4.7. Mutual Obligations.\n\n     (a) The parties agree and acknowledge that, in addition to the rights granted or to be granted to the parties herein, certain other rights to software source code, object code and documentation, and trademarks and service marks related thereto, are described on Exhibit M.\n\n     (b) The parties acknowledge and agree that as of the Closing Date, the UK mainframe environment, consisting of mainframe computer hardware (Mainframe Hardware) and certain third party software (OEM Software), currently consists of three (3) logical partitions (LPARs), two (2) of which are shared between Equifax and Certegy. The parties acknowledge and agree that certain OEM Software (MIPS-Based Software) being used on the Mainframe Hardware contains limitations based upon the number of millions of instructions per second (MIPS) performed; other OEM Software (CPU-Based Software) being used on the Mainframe Hardware contains limitations based upon CPU group ratings. The parties also acknowledge and agree that they have previously determined the number of MIPS available, for each party, in excess of the current combined MIPS usage, in connection with the MIPS-Based Software (Projected MIPS), and in connection with the CPU-Based Software (Overhead MIPS), both as set forth on Exhibit N. With respect to the foregoing, the parties hereby agree as follows:\n\n          (i) Certegy agrees that it shall, no later than March 31, 2002, establish, or cause to be established, one or more new and separate LPAR(s) and that Certegy shall no longer share any LPAR with Equifax. Certegy shall be responsible for paying any and all additional software license fees, service fees, fees related to hardware, or other similar fees incurred to establish the new LPAR(s) and to migrate from the existing to the new LPAR(s). Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if the deadline for LPAR separation is not met by Certegy prior to March 31, 2002, any costs or fees, including all\n\n\n\n\n\nfees, costs or expenses incurred as a result of\n\n                                       18\n\nincreased capacity or speed requirements or otherwise, incurred by either party due to the non-separation shall be borne by Certegy.\n\n          (ii) If either party, prior to or at the time of the complete separation of LPARs (described in subsection (i) above), exceeds its respective Projected MIPS for any year, and, thereafter, any of the MIPS-Based Software is required, under the terms of the respective software licenses, to be upgraded to allow usage of the additional MIPS, the party first exceeding its respective Projected MIPS (Triggering Party) shall bear the full cost and expense of upgrading the MIPS-Based Software licenses (whether or not such party ultimately caused the MIPS limitations to be exceeded). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time after an upgrade to a MIPS-Based Software license is purchased, if the non-Triggering Party exceeds its Projected MIPS during a respective year, such non-Triggering Party shall pay the Triggering Party an amount equal to the total cost to the Triggering Party of purchasing the upgrade multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of MIPS used by the non-Triggering Party that exceeds its original Projected MIPS, and the denominator of which is the total number of MIPS permitted or allowable pursuant to the MIPS-Based Software upgrade, but excluding the total number of MIPS permitted prior to the upgrade.\n\n          (iii) If either party, prior to or at the time of the complete separation of LPARs (described in subsection (i) above), exceeds its respective Overhead MIPS for any year, and, thereafter, the CPU-Based Software is required, under the terms of the respective software licenses, to be upgraded to allow usage of the additional MIPS, the party first exceeding its respective Overhead MIPS (CPU Triggering Party) shall bear the full cost and expense of upgrading the CPU-Based Software licenses (whether or not such party ultimately caused the MIPS limitations to be exceeded). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time after an upgrade to a CPU-Based Software license is purchased, if the other party (non-CPU Triggering Party) exceeds its Overhead MIPS during a respective year, such non-CPU Triggering Party shall pay the CPU Triggering Party an amount equal to the total cost to the CPU Triggering Party of purchasing the upgrade multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of MIPS used by the non-CPU Triggering Party that exceeds its original Overhead MIPS, and the denominator of which is the total number of MIPS permitted or allowable pursuant to the CPU-Based Software upgrade, but excluding the total number of MIPS permitted prior to the upgrade.\n\n          (iv) The rules related to OEM Software upgrade requirements described in subsections (ii) and (iii) above shall apply in the same manner, before or after the completion of the LPAR separation, with respect to Mainframe Hardware upgrade requirements.\n\n          (v) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Certegy shall cease the use of any software or hardware that is shared between the parties no later than the date which is two (2) years following the Closing Date.\n\n     (c) The parties acknowledge that the Licensed Materials are intellectual property within the meaning of Section 101 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act and shall be subject to Section 365(n) thereof, all as set forth in the Intellectual Property Bankruptcy Protection Act, Public Law 100-506, 102 Stat. 2538.\n\n                                       19\n\n     (d) In full and complete payment of the licenses granted in this Agreement, the parties have made the payment described in the Distribution Agreement as set forth in the Distribution Agreement.\n\n     (e) Each party shall notify the other party of any involuntary attachment or other judicial process affecting the Licensed Materials.\n\n                                    ARTICLE V\n\n                                   THE CLOSING\n\n     Section 5.1. Equifax Deliverables.\n\n     On or before the Distribution Date, and effective as of the Closing Date, Equifax will, and/or will cause each member of the Equifax Group to, deliver to Certegy each of the following:\n\n     (a) Duly executed assignment and assumption agreements necessary for the assignment and transfer to, and the assumption by Certegy of, the Transferred Equifax Assets and Transferred Equifax Third Party Agreements;\n\n     (b) Duly executed assignment and assumption agreements necessary for the assignment and transfer to, and the assumption by Equifax of, the Equifax Liabilities; and\n\n     (c)  Such other agreements, leases, documents or instruments as the parties may agree are necessary or desirable in order to achieve the purposes of this Agreement.\n\n     Section 5.2. Certegy Deliverables.\n\n     On the Closing Date, Certegy will, and/or will cause each member of the\n\n\n\n\n\nCertegy Group to, deliver to Equifax each of the following:\n\n     (a) Duly executed assignment and assumption agreements necessary for the assignment and transfer to, and the assumption by Equifax of, the Transferred Certegy Assets and the Transferred Certegy Third Party Agreements;\n\n     (b) Duly executed assignment and assumption agreements necessary for the assignment and transfer to, and the assumption by Certegy of, the Certegy Liabilities; and\n\n     (c) Such other agreements, documents or instruments as the parties may agree are necessary or desirable in order to achieve the purposes of this Agreement.\n\n                                       20\n\n                                   ARTICLE VI\n\n                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES\n\n     Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or any Related Agreement, neither any member of the Equifax Group, nor any member of the Certegy Group, has given or is giving any representation or warranty regarding the assets or Liabilities retained, transferred, assumed or licensed as contemplated hereby or thereby, including without limitation, (i) title to the assets, (ii) validity of the Liabilities, (iii) any lien, claim or other encumbrance affecting the assets or Liabilities, or (iv) the value of the assets and the amount of the Liabilities. Except as may be expressly set forth in this Agreement or any Related Agreement, all assets and Liabilities were, or are being, transferred, assigned, licensed, assumed, or are being retained, on an AS IS, WHERE IS basis and the respective transferees, licensees and assignees will bear the economic and legal risks that any such conveyance (x) shall prove to be insufficient to vest in the transferee a title that is free and clear of any lien, claim or other encumbrance, or (y) shall not constitute an infringement of a third party's rights.\n\n                                   ARTICLE VII\n\n                                 INDEMNIFICATION\n\n     Section 7.1. Certegy Indemnification of the Equifax Group.\n\n     If the Distribution occurs, on and after the Distribution Date, Certegy shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each member of the Equifax Group, and each of their respective directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively the Equifax Indemnitees) from and against any and all damage, loss, liability and expense, (including without limitation, reasonable expenses of investigation and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with any and all Actions or threatened Actions (collectively, Indemnifiable Losses) incurred or suffered by any of the Equifax Indemnitees and arising out of, or due to, the failure of Certegy, or any other member of the Certegy Group, to timely pay, perform or otherwise discharge, any of the Certegy Liabilities or its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n                                       21\n\n     Section 7.2. Equifax Indemnification of the Certegy Group.\n\n     If the Distribution occurs, on and after the Distribution Date, Equifax shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each member of the Certegy Group and each of their respective directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively the Certegy Indemnitees) from and against any and all Indemnifiable Losses incurred or suffered by any of the Certegy Indemnitees and arising out of, or due to, the failure of Equifax, or any other member of the Equifax Group, to timely pay, perform or otherwise discharge, any of the Equifax Liabilities or its obligations under this Agreement or any Related Agreement.\n\n     Section 7.3. Insurance and Third Party Obligations.\n\n     No insurer or any other third party shall be, by virtue of the foregoing indemnification provisions, (a) entitled to a benefit it would not be entitled to receive in the absence of such provisions, (b) relieved of the responsibility to pay any claims to which it is obligated, or (c) entitled to any subrogation rights with respect to any obligation hereunder.\n\n                                  ARTICLE VIII\n\n                           INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURES\n\n     Section 8.1. Notice and Payment of Claims.\n\n     If any Equifax Indemnitee or Certegy Indemnitee (the Indemnified Party) determines that it is or may be entitled to indemnification by a party (the Indemnifying Party) under Article VII (other than in connection with any Action or claim subject to Section 8.2), the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party a written notice specifying, to the extent reasonably practicable, the basis for its claim for indemnification and the amount for which the Indemnified Party reasonably believes it is entitled to be indemnified. After the Indemnifying Party shall have been notified of the amount for which the Indemnified Party seeks indemnification, the Indemnifying Party\n\n\n\n\n\nshall, within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice, pay the Indemnified Party such amount in cash or other immediately available funds (or reach agreement with the Indemnified Party as to a mutually agreeable alternative payment schedule) unless the Indemnifying Party objects to the claim for indemnification or the amount thereof. If the Indemnifying Party does not give the Indemnified Party written notice objecting to such claim and setting forth the grounds therefor within the same thirty (30) day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have acknowledged its liability for such claim and the Indemnified Party may exercise any and all of its rights under applicable law to collect such amount. Any amount owed under this Section 8.1 that is past due shall bear interest at a simple rate of interest per annum equal to the lesser of 1% per month or the maximum amount permitted by law.\n\n     Section 8.2. Notice and Defense of Third Party Claims.\n\n     (a) Promptly following the earlier of (i) receipt of notice of the commencement by a third party of any Action against or otherwise involving any Indemnified Party, or (ii) receipt of information from a third party alleging the existence of a claim against an Indemnified Party,\n\n                                       22\n\nwith respect to which indemnification may be sought pursuant to this Agreement (a Third Party Claim), the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party written notice thereof. The failure of the Indemnified Party to give notice as provided in this Section 8.2(a) shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure to give notice. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice, the Indemnifying Party shall by giving written notice thereof to the Indemnified Party, (i) acknowledge, as between the parties hereto, liability for and, at its option, elect to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim at its sole cost and expense, or (ii) object to the claim of indemnification set forth in the notice delivered by the Indemnified Party pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 8.2(a) setting forth the grounds therefor; provided that if the Indemnifying Party does not within the same thirty (30) day period give the Indemnified Party written notice acknowledging liability or objecting to such claim and setting forth the grounds therefor, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have acknowledged, as between the parties hereto, its liability for such Third Party Claim.\n\n     (b) Any contest of a Third Party Claim as to which the Indemnifying Party has elected to assume the defense shall be conducted by attorneys employed by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; provided that the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in such proceedings and to be represented by attorneys of its own choosing at the Indemnified Party's sole cost and expense. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle or compromise the claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party; provided that the Indemnifying Party may not agree to any such settlement pursuant to which any such remedy or relief, other than monetary damages for which the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible hereunder, shall be applied to or against the Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.\n\n     (c) If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of a Third Party Claim for which it has acknowledged liability for indemnification under Article VII, the Indemnified Party may require the Indemnifying Party to reimburse it on a current basis for its reasonable expenses of investigation, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in defending against such Third Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party shall be bound by the result obtained with respect thereto by the Indemnified Party; provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party in cash the amount for which the Indemnified Party is entitled to be indemnified (if any) within fifteen (15) days after the final resolution of such Third Party Claim (whether by settlement, compromise, or by the final nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise), or, in the case of any Third Party Claim as to which the Indemnifying Party has not acknowledged liability, within fifteen (15) days after the Indemnifying Party's objection has been resolved by settlement, compromise, or the final nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n     (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall either Equifax or Certegy, or any Member of their respective Group, have any liability, whether based on contract, tort (including, without limitation, negligence or strict liability), warranty or any other legal or equitable\n\n                                       23\n\ngrounds, for any punitive, consequential, indirect, exemplary, special or incidental loss or damage suffered by the other arising from or related to this Agreement, including without limitation, loss of data, profits, interest or revenue, or interruption of business, even if such party has been informed of or might otherwise anticipated or foreseen the possibility of such losses or damages; provided, however, that such limitations shall not apply to liabilities which may arise as the result of willful misconduct of a party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any damages awarded or obtained (whether by settlement, compromise or judgment) as a result of Third Party Claims shall be considered direct damages for purposes of this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                   ARTICLE IX\n\n                                 CONFIDENTIALITY\n\n     Section 9.1. Exclusions.\n\n     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Company Information does not include any information that before being divulged by the receiving party (a) has become generally known to the public through no wrongful act of the receiving party; (b) has been rightfully received by the receiving party from a third party without restriction on disclosure and without, to the knowledge of the receiving party, a breach of an obligation of confidentiality running directly or indirectly to the disclosing party; (c) has been approved for release to the general public by a written authorization of the disclosing party; (d) has been independently developed by the receiving party without use, directly or indirectly, of Company Information received from the disclosing party; or (e) has been furnished to a third party by the disclosing party without restrictions on the third party's rights to disclose the information.\n\n     Section 9.2. Confidentiality.\n\n     (a) Each party acknowledges, and shall cause each member of the Group to acknowledge, that it is in possession of significant confidential or proprietary information concerning the business, operations and assets of the members of the other Group.\n\n     (b) Each party shall, and shall ensure that each member of its Group shall, (i) receive and hold the Company Information of the other Group in trust and in strictest confidence; (ii) protect such Company Information from disclosure and in no event take any action causing, or fail to take the action necessary in order to prevent, any such Company Information to lose its character as Company Information; (iii) exercise at a minimum the same care it would exercise to protect its own highly confidential information; and (iv) not use, reproduce, distribute, disclose, or otherwise disseminate the Company Information of the other Group, (A) except as authorized pursuant to this Agreement or any Related Agreement, or (B) except pursuant to a requirement of a governmental agency or of law without similar restrictions or other protections against public disclosure; provided, however, with respect to disclosures pursuant to (B) above, the receiving party must first give written notice of such required disclosure to the disclosing party, take reasonable steps to allow the disclosing party to seek to protect the confidentiality of the Company Information required to be disclosed, make a reasonable effort to obtain a protective order requiring that the Company Information so disclosed be used only for the purposes for which disclosure is required, and shall disclose only that part of the Company Information\n\n                                       24\n\nwhich, in the written opinion of its legal counsel, it is required to disclose. In no event shall the receiving party exercise less than a reasonable standard of care to keep confidential the Company Information. Any and all reproductions of such Company Information must prominently contain a confidential legend.\n\n     (c) The receiving party may make disclosures of the Company Information of the disclosing party only to Representatives of the receiving party's Group (i) who have a specific need to know such information; and (ii) who the receiving party has obligated under a written agreement to hold such Company Information in trust and in strictest confidence and otherwise to comply with the terms and provisions of this Agreement or terms and conditions substantially similar to and implementing the same restrictions and covenants as those set forth in this Agreement. Certegy and Equifax agree, and shall ensure that each member of their respective Group agrees, to diligently monitor each such Representative, diligently enforce such agreements with its Representatives, and, upon request by the other party, promptly to furnish to the other party a certified list of the receiving party's Representatives having had access to such Company Information.\n\n     (d) The covenants of confidentiality set forth in this Agreement (i) will apply after the Closing Date to all Company Information disclosed to the receiving party before, on and after the Closing Date and (ii) will continue and must be maintained from the Closing Date through the termination of the relationship under this Agreement between Equifax and Certegy (A) with respect to Proprietary Information, the period during which the Proprietary Information constituting a part of the Company Information retains its status as a trade secret under applicable law; and (B) with respect to Confidential Information constituting a part of the Company Information, for the shorter of a period equal to three (3) years after the Closing Date, or until such Confidential Information no longer qualifies as confidential under applicable law.\n\n     Section 9.3. Employee Confidentiality Agreements.\n\n     The members of each Group have entered into confidentiality and non- disclosure agreements with their respective employees. To the extent that any employee during or after employment violates any such agreement and such violation is or may in the future be to the detriment of the other Group, at the written request of the affected party, the other party shall, or shall cause the appropriate members of its Group to, promptly bring and diligently pursue an action against such employee if and to the extent reasonable under the circumstances to preserve the value of the assets and Licensed Materials. The Group member employing the employee violating his/her confidentiality and non- disclosure agreement shall have the unilateral right to determine the forum for, the manner of proceeding in, and legal counsel for such action and shall be\n\n\n\n\n\nentitled to any damages or other relief against such employee awarded in such action to the extent related to such Group's assets or business or to the Licensed Materials. Such enforcement against and recovery by a Group member from its breaching employee shall not constitute a release or sole remedy for the members of the other Group injured by such breaching employee's actions, and such members of the other Group may bring a claim against the Group members employing the breaching employee for a breach of this Agreement. Each party shall bear all out-of-pocket costs of pursuing such action and the other party shall cooperate in connection therewith.\n\n                                       25\n\n     Section 9.4. Rights and Remedies.\n\n     (a) If either party, or any member of the Group, should breach or threaten to breach any of the provisions of this Agreement, the non-breaching party, in addition to any other remedies it may have at law or in equity, will be entitled to a restraining order, injunction, or other similar remedy in order to specifically enforce the provisions of this Agreement. Each party specifically acknowledges, and shall cause each member of its respective Group to acknowledge, that money damages alone would be an inadequate remedy for the injuries and damage that would be suffered and incurred by the non-breaching party as a result of a breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement. In the event that either party, or a member of such party's Group, should seek an injunction hereunder, the other party hereby waives, and shall cause each member of its Group to waive, any requirement for the submission of proof of the economic value of any Company Information or the posting of a bond or any other security. In the event of a dispute between the parties, the non-prevailing party shall pay all costs and expenses associated with resolving the dispute, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees.\n\n     (b) The receiving party shall notify the disclosing party immediately upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of Company Information, or any other breach of this Agreement by the receiving party or any Representative of the receiving party's Group, and will cooperate with the disclosing party in every reasonable way to help the disclosing party regain possession of its Company Information and prevent its further unauthorized use or disclosure. The receiving party shall be responsible for the acts of any Representative of its Group that are in violation of this Agreement.\n\n     Section 9.5. Competitive Activities.\n\n     (a) Subject to the rights and obligations set forth in this Article IX, each party understands and acknowledges that the other party's Group may now market or have under development products that are competitive with products or services now offered or that may be offered by it and/or members of its Group, and the parties' communications hereunder will not serve to impair the right of either party, or any member of its respective Group, to independently develop, make, use, procure, or market products or services now or in the future that may be competitive with those offered by the other party's Group, nor require either party, and/or the members of its Group, to disclose any planning or other information to the other party.\n\n     (b) Neither party will be restricted in using, in the development, manufacturing and marketing of its products and services and its operations, any data processing or network management or operation ideas, concepts, know-how and techniques which are retained in the minds of employees who have had access to the other party's Company Information subject to the restrictions set forth in this Agreement.\n\n     Section 9.6. No Implied Rights.\n\n     Except as provided herein or in any Related Agreement, all Company Information is and shall remain the property of the disclosing party and/or the respective member of its Group. By disclosing Company Information to the receiving\n\n                                       26\n\nparty's Group, the disclosing party and/or the members of its Group do(es) not grant any express or implied rights or license to the receiving party's Group to or under any patents, patent applications, inventions, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret information, or other intellectual property rights heretofore or hereafter possessed by the disclosing party and/or the members of its Group.\n\n                                    ARTICLE X\n\n                              CONTINUED ASSISTANCE\n\n     Section 10.1. Continued Assistance and Transition.\n\n     (a) Following the Closing Date, Equifax shall, and shall cause each member of the Equifax Group to, cooperate in an orderly transfer of the Transferred Equifax Assets and the Transferred Equifax Third Party Agreements to Certegy or the respective Designated Certegy Member. From time to time, at Certegy's request and without further consideration, Equifax shall, and shall cause each member of the Equifax Group, as applicable, to execute, acknowledge and deliver such documents, instruments or assurances and take such other action as Certegy may reasonably request to more effectively assign, convey and transfer any of the Transferred Equifax Assets and the Transferred Equifax Third Party\n\n\n\n\n\nAgreements. Equifax will assist Certegy in the vesting, collection or reduction to possession of such Transferred Equifax Assets and Transferred Equifax Third Party Agreements.\n\n     (b) Following the Closing Date, Certegy shall, and shall cause each member of the Certegy Group to, cooperate in an orderly transfer of the Transferred Certegy Assets and Transferred Certegy Third Party Agreements to Equifax or the respective Designated Equifax Member. From time to time, at Equifax's request and without further consideration, Certegy shall, and shall cause each member of the Certegy Group, as applicable, to execute, acknowledge and deliver such documents, instruments or assurances and take such other action as Equifax may reasonably request to more effectively assign, convey and transfer any of the Transferred Certegy Assets and Transferred Certegy Third Party Agreements. Certegy will assist Equifax in the vesting, collection or reduction to possession of such Transferred Certegy Assets and Transferred Certegy Third Party Agreements.\n\n     Section 10.2. Records and Documents.\n\n     (a) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Equifax and Certegy shall each arrange for the delivery to the other of existing corporate and other documents (e.g. documents of title, source code, contracts, etc.) in its possession relating to the Transferred Assets, Transferred Third Party Agreements and assumed Liabilities.\n\n     (b) From and after the Closing Date, Equifax and Certegy shall each, and shall cause each member of its Group to, afford the other and its accountants, counsel and other designated Representatives reasonable access (including using reasonable efforts to give access to person or firms possessing such information) and duplicating rights during normal business hours to all records, books, contracts, instruments, computer data and other data and information in its possession relating to the assets, Liabilities, Licensed Materials, business and affairs of the other (other than data and information subject to any attorney/client or other privilege), insofar as such\n\n                                       27\n\naccess is reasonably required by the other, including without limitation, for audit, accounting and litigation purposes.\n\n     (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may destroy or otherwise dispose of any information at any time in accordance with the corporate record retention policy maintained by such party with respect to its own records.\n\n     Section 10.3. Litigation Cooperation.\n\n     Upon written request, Equifax and Certegy shall, and shall cause each member of its Group to, use reasonable efforts to cooperate in the evaluation and defense of third party Actions arising out of the business of the other party or of any member of the other party's Group prior to the Distribution Date in which the requesting party or any member of its Group may from time to time be involved, at the cost and expense of the requesting party. Such cooperation shall include, without limitation, making its Representatives available as witnesses or consultants to the extent that such persons may reasonably be required in connection with such third party Actions.\n\n                                   ARTICLE XI\n\n                                  MISCELLANEOUS\n\n     Section 11.1. Expenses.\n\n     Except as specifically provided in this Agreement or any Related Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery and implementation of this Agreement and with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including transfer taxes and the fees and expenses of all counsel, accountants and financial and other advisors) shall be paid by Equifax.\n\n     Section 11.2.

Amendment and Waiver.\n\n     This Agreement may not be altered or amended, nor may any rights hereunder be waived, except by an instrument in writing executed by the party or parties to be charged with such amendment or waiver.

ARTICLE 1. EXERCISE. 1.1 Method of Exercise. Payment. (a) Cash Exercise. The purchase rights represented by this Warrant may be exercised by the Holder, in whole or in part, by the surrender of this Warrant (with the notice of exercise form attached hereto as Appendix 1 duly executed) at the principal office of the Company, and by the payment to the Company, by certified, cashier's or other check acceptable to the Company or by wire transfer to an account designated by the Company, of an amount equal to the aggregate Exercise Price of the Shares being purchased.\n\n\n\n\n\n10 (b) Net Issue Exercise. In lieu of exercising this Warrant, the Holder may elect to receive Shares equal to the value of this Warrant (or the portion thereof being canceled) by surrender of this Warrant at the principal office of the Company together with notice of such election, in which event the Company shall issue to the Holder a number of Warrant Shares computed using the following formula: Y (A-B) X = \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 A Where: X = the number of Shares to be issued to the Holder. Y = the number of the Shares being exercised on the date of determination. A = the fair market value of one Share on the date of determination. B = the per share Exercise Price (as adjusted to the date of such calculation). (c) Fair Market Value. For purposes of this Article 1, the per share fair market value of the Warrant Shares shall mean:\n\n\n\n\n\n11 (i) If the Company's Common Stock is publicly traded, the per share fair market value of the Warrant Shares shall be the average of the closing prices of the Common Stock as quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, or the principal exchange on which the Common Stock is listed, in each case for the fifteen trading days ending five trading days prior to the date of determination of fair market value; (ii) If the Company's Common Stock is not so publicly traded, the per share fair market value of the Warrant Shares shall be such fair market value as is determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company after taking into consideration factors it deems appropriate, including, without limitation, recent sale and offer prices of the capital stock of the Company in private transactions negotiated at arm's length. 1.2 Delivery of Certificate and New Warrant. Promptly after Holder first exercises this Warrant, the Company shall deliver to Holder certificates for or other evidence (reasonably acceptable to the Holder) of the Shares received and, if this Warrant has not been fully exercised and has not expired, a new Warrant representing the Shares not so received. 1.3 Replacement of Warrants. On receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant and, in the case of loss, theft or destruction, on delivery of an indemnity agreement reasonably satisfactory in form and amount to the Company or, in the case of mutilation, on surrender and cancellation of this Warrant, the Company shall execute and deliver, in lieu of this Warrant, a new warrant of like tenor. ARTICLE 2. ADJUSTMENTS TO THE SHARES. 2.1 Stock Dividends, Splits, Combinations, Etc. If the Company declares or pays a dividend on the Shares payable in Common Stock, or other securities, then upon exercise of this Warrant, for each Share acquired, Holder shall receive, without cost to Holder, the total number and kind of securities to which Holder would have been entitled had Holder owned the Shares of record as of the date the dividend occurred. If the Company subdivides the Shares by reclassification or otherwise into a greater number of shares or takes any other action which increases the amount of stock into which the Shares are convertible, the number of shares purchasable hereunder shall be proportionately increased and the Exercise Price shall remain the same. If the outstanding shares of the Company are combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares, the Exercise Price shall be proportionately increased and the number of Shares shall be proportionately decreased. 2.2 Reclassification, Exchange or Substitution, Etc. Upon any reclassification, exchange, substitution, or other event that results in a change of the number and/or class of the securities issuable upon exercise or net exercise of this Warrant, Holder shall be entitled to receive, upon exercise or net exercise of this Warrant, the number and kind of securities and property that Holder would have received for the Shares if this Warrant had been exercised immediately before such reclassification, exchange, substitution, or other event. The Company or its successor shall promptly issue to Holder an amendment to this Warrant setting forth the number and kind of such new securities or other property issuable upon exercise or net exercise of this Warrant as a result of such reclassification, exchange, substitution or other event that results in a change of the number and/or class of securities issuable upon exercise or net exercise of this Warrant.\n\n\n\n\n\n12 2.3 Merger or Consolidation. Upon any capital reorganization of the Company's capital stock (other than a subdivision, combination, reclassification or exchange of shares provided for elsewhere in this Section 2) or a merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another corporation, then as a part of such reorganization, merger or consolidation, provision shall be made so that the Holder shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon the exercise of this Warrant, the number and kind of securities and property of the Company, or of the successor corporation resulting from such reorganization, merger or consolidation, to which that Holder would have received for the Shares if this Warrant had been exercised immediately before such reorganization, merger or consolidation. 2.4 Fractional Shares.

On the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained, and subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, Sandler O'Neill accepts such appointment and agrees to use its best efforts to assist the Company with the solicitation of subscriptions and purchase orders for Securities in accordance with this Agreement; provided, however, that the Agent shall not be obligated to take any action which is inconsistent with any applicable laws, regulations, decisions or orders. The services to be rendered by Sandler O'Neill pursuant to this appointment include the following: (i) consulting as to the securities marketing implications of any aspect of the Plans or related corporate documents; (ii) reviewing with the Board of Directors of the Company, the MHCs and the Bank financial and securities marketing implications of the Appraiser's appraisal of the Common Stock; (iii) reviewing all offering documents, including the Prospectus, stock order forms and related offering materials (it being understood that preparation and filing of such documents is the sole responsibility of the Company and the Bank and their counsel); (iv) assisting in the design and implementation of a marketing strategy for the Offerings; (v) assisting management of the Company and the Bank in preparing for meetings with potential investors and broker-dealers; and (vi) providing such other general advice and assistance regarding financial and marketing aspects of the Offering as may be requested to promote the successful completion of the Offering.\n\nThe appointment of the Agent hereunder shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (a) forty-five (45) days after the last day of the Subscription and Community Offering, unless\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\nthe Company and the Agent agree in writing to extend such period and the OTS agrees to extend the period of time in which the Securities may be sold, or (b) the receipt and acceptance of subscriptions and purchase orders for all of the Securities, or (c) the completion of the Syndicated Community Offering.\n\nIf any of the Securities remain available after the expiration of the Subscription and Community Offering, at the request of the Company and the Bank, Sandler O'Neill will seek to form a syndicate of registered brokers or dealers (Selected Dealers) to assist in the solicitation of purchase orders of such Securities on a best efforts basis.

Appropriate arrangements for placing the funds received from subscriptions for Securities or other offers to purchase Securities in\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\nspecial interest-bearing accounts with the Bank until all Securities are sold and paid for were made prior to the commencement of the Subscription Offering, with provision for refund to the purchasers as set forth above, or for delivery to the Company if all Securities are sold.\n\nIf at least the total minimum of Securities, as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus, are sold, the Company agrees to issue or have issued the Securities sold and to release for delivery certificates for such Securities at the Closing Time against payment therefor by release of funds from the special interest-bearing accounts referred to above. The closing shall be held at the offices of Elias, Matz, Tiernan & Herrick L.L.P., at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Standard Time, or at such other place and time as shall be agreed upon by the parties hereto, on a business day to be agreed upon by the parties hereto. The Company shall notify the Agent by telephone, confirmed in writing, when funds shall have been received for all the Securities. Certificates for Securities shall be delivered directly to the purchasers thereof in accordance with their directions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, certificates for Securities purchased through Selected Dealers shall be made available to the Agent for inspection at least 48 hours prior to the Closing Time at such office as the Agent shall designate. The hour and date upon which the Company shall release for delivery all of the Securities, in accordance with the terms hereof, is herein called the Closing Time.\n\nThe Company will pay any stock issue and transfer taxes which may be payable with respect to the sale of the Securities.\n\nIn addition to the reimbursement of the expenses specified in Section 4 hereof, the Agent will receive the following compensation for its services hereunder:\n\n(a) One percent (1.00%) of the aggregate purchase price of the Securities sold in the Subscription and Community Offering, excluding in each case shares purchased by (i) any employee benefit plan of the Company or the Bank established for the benefit of their respective directors, officers and employees, and (ii) any director, officer or employee of the Company or the Bank or members of their immediate families (which term shall mean parents, grandparents, spouse, siblings, children and grandchildren); and\n\n(b) With respect to any Securities sold by a National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD) member firm (other than Sandler O'Neill) in the Syndicated Community Offering, (i) the compensation payable to Selected Dealers, (ii) any sponsoring dealer's fees; and (iii) a management fee to Sandler O'Neill of one percent (1.0 %) of the aggregate purchase price of the Securities sold in the Syndicated Community Offering. Any fees payable to Sandler O'Neill for Securities sold by Sandler O'Neill under any such agreement shall be limited to an aggregate of six percent (6.0 %) of the purchase price of the Securities sold by Sandler O'Neill and other NASD member firms.\n\nIf this Agreement is terminated by the Agent in accordance with the provisions of Section 9(a) hereof, no fee shall be payable by the Company to Sandler O'Neill; provided, however, that the Company shall reimburse the Agent for all of its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred prior to termination, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Agent in accordance with the provisions of Section 4 hereof. In addition, the\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany shall be obligated to pay the fees and expenses as contemplated by the provisions of Section 4 hereof in the event of any such termination.\n\nAll fees payable to the Agent hereunder shall be payable in immediately available funds at Closing Time, or upon the termination of this Agreement, as the case may be. In recognition of the long lead times involved in the conversion process, the Bank agreed to make an advance payment to the Agent in the amount of $25,000, all of which has been previously paid, which shall be credited against any fees or reimbursement of expenses payable hereunder. In the event that the advance payment exceeds the amount due in payment of fees and reimbursement of expenses hereunder, the excess shall be refunded.\n\nSECTION 3.

respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Act and the Securities Act Regulations; (iii) based upon limited procedures as agreed upon by the Agent and Deloitte & Touche LLP set forth in detail in such letter, nothing has come to their attention which causes them to believe that (A) the unaudited consolidated financial statements and supporting schedules of the Company

Regulations or are not presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, (B) the unaudited amounts of net interest income and net income set forth under Selected Financial and Other Data in the Registration Statement and Prospectus do not agree with the amounts set forth in unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the dates and periods presented under such captions or such amounts were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with that used in determining the corresponding amounts in the audited financial statements included in the Registration Statement, (C) at a specified date not more than five (5) business days prior to the date of this Agreement, there has been any increase in the consolidated long-term or short-term debt of the Company or any decrease in

conditions included in the Registration Statement or, (D) during the period from January 1, 2006 to a specified date not more than five (5) business days prior to the date of this Agreement, there

before income tax expense or net income of the Company, except in all instances for increases or decreases which the Registration Statement and the Prospectus disclose have occurred or may occur; and (iv) in addition to the examination referred to in their opinions and the limited procedures referred to in clause (iii) above, they have carried out certain specified procedures, not constituting an audit, with respect to certain amounts, percentages and financial information which are included in the Registration Statement and Prospectus and which are specified by the Agent, and have found such amounts, percentages and financial information to be in agreement with the relevant accounting, financial and other records of the Company, the MHCs and the Bank identified in such letter.\n\n(g) At

approved for quotation on the Nasdaq Global Market upon notice of issuance.\n\n(i) At Closing Time, the Agent shall have received a letter from the Appraiser, dated as of the Closing Time, confirming

Exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market shall not have been suspended, and minimum or maximum prices for trading shall not have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices for securities have been required,

An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to no more than one local counsel in each separate jurisdiction in which any action or proceeding is commenced) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances.\n\n(d) The Company, the MHCs and the Bank also agree that the Agent shall not have any liability (whether direct or indirect, in contract or tort or otherwise) to the MHCs and its members, the Bank, the Company's, the MHCs's or the Bank's creditors relating to or arising out of the engagement of the Agent pursuant to, or the performance by the Agent of the services contemplated by, this Agreement.\n\n(e) In addition to, and without limiting, the provisions of Section (6)(a)(iv) hereof, in the event that the Agent, any person, if any, who controls the Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act or any of its partners, directors, officers, employees or agents is requested or required to appear as a witness or otherwise gives testimony in any action, proceeding, investigation or inquiry brought by or on behalf of or against the Company, the MHCs, the Bank, the Agent or any of its respective affiliates or any participant in the transactions contemplated hereby in which the Agent or such person or agent is not named as a defendant, the Company, the MHCs, and the Bank, jointly and severally, agree to reimburse the Agent and its partners, directors, officers, employees or agents for all reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with preparing or appearing as a witness or otherwise giving testimony and to compensate the Agent and its partners, directors, officers, employees or agents in an amount to be mutually agreed upon.\n\nSECTION 7. CONTRIBUTION. In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason held to be unenforceable by the indemnified parties although applicable in accordance with its terms, the Company, the MHCs, the Bank, and the Agent shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by said indemnity agreement incurred by the Company, the MHCs or the Bank and the Agent, as incurred, in such proportions (i) that the Agent is responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the maximum aggregate\n\n37\n\n\n\n\n\nmarketing fees appearing on the cover page of the Prospectus bears to the maximum aggregate gross proceeds appearing thereon and the Company, the MHCs and the Bank are jointly and severally responsible for the balance or (ii) if, but only if, the allocation provided for in clause (i) is for any reason held unenforceable, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits to the Company, the MHCs and the Bank on the one hand and the Agent on the other, as reflected in clause (i), but also the relative fault of the Company, the MHCs and the Bank on the one hand and the Agent on the other, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; provided, however, that no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section, each person, if any, who controls the Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Agent, and each director of the Company, the MHCs and the Bank, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company, the MHCs or the Bank within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, the MHCs and the Bank. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, to the extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Agent be required to contribute an aggregate amount in excess of the aggregate marketing fees to which the Agent is entitled and actually paid pursuant to this Agreement.\n\nSECTION 8. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS TO SURVIVE DELIVERY. All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, or contained in certificates of officers of the Company, the MHCs or the Bank submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Agent or any controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of the Securities.\n\nSECTION 9.

Pey Dirt, or its representatives, shall, upon two weeks' written notice, have the right at all reasonable times (prior to the expiration of two (2) years after the termination of the Contract Period) to inspect and make copies of the books and records of Company insofar as they shall relate to the computation of royalties to be paid to Pey Dirt hereunder and the shipment of Endorsed Products pursuant to this Agreement.  In the event that any such inspections show an underreporting and underpayment in excess of five percent (5%) for any twelve (12) month period, then Company shall pay the cost of such examination.\n\n      7.    Labels/Packaging. (a) It is understood that each of the Endorsed Products shipped by Company or its container or the packaging therefor shall have affixed thereto a label or other permanent identification which includes Manning Identification.\n\n      (b)   It is hereby agreed that the back panel of the Endorsed Products' packaging will feature ad copy or offers as determined by Pey Dirt and its agent, subject to Company's right to reasonably reject such materials only if such materials are clearly offensive to a majority of the populace.

Further, the side panel of the Endorsed Products packaging shall feature a charity or other entity of Manning's sole choice.

All costs related to any such trademarks shall be borne by Company, and ownership of any such trademarks shall rest solely in the name of Pey Dirt or its designee.  Upon registration of any such trademark, Pey Dirt shall grant to Company a license for the use of such registered trademark on or in connection with the advertisement, promotion and sale of Endorsed Products, which license shall be coextensive and coterminous with the rights granted thereunder with respect to Manning Identification and shall require no increase in the payments set forth but shall contain such additional provisions as Pey Dirt reasonably believes are necessary for the protection of such trademark registered in the name of Manning or Pey Dirt. Company agrees that it will not file, during the Contract Period or thereafter, any application for trademark registration or otherwise obtain or attempt to obtain ownership of any trademark or trade name within the Contract Territory or in any other country of the world which consists of Manning Identification or any mark, design or logo intended to make reference to Manning or to identify products endorsed by Manning.

In order to be a sufficient notice hereunder, any such written notice shall specify in detail each item of default and shall specify the provision of this Agreement which applies to each item of default, and shall specify in detail the action the defaulting party must take in order to cure each such item of default. The termination rights set forth in this section shall not constitute the exclusive remedy of the nondefaulting party hereunder, however, and if default is made by either party hereunder, the other may resort to such other remedies as said party would have been entitled to if this section had been omitted from this Agreement.  Termination under the provisions of this section shall be without prejudice to any rights or claims which the terminating party may otherwise have against the defaulting party.\n\n                                      -6-\n\n      (b)   Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the cure periods set forth in subparagraphs (a)(i) and (a)(ii) above only apply to Company's first default under this Agreement.  Accordingly, Pey Dirt may, after Company's first default has occurred under either subparagraph (a)(i) or subparagraph (a)(ii) above and has been cured, thereafter immediately terminate this Agreement upon any further defaults by Company hereunder without providing Company an opportunity to cure any additional defaults.\n\n      13.   Termination.  From and after the termination of the Contract Period all of the rights of Company to the use of Manning Identification shall cease absolutely and Company shall not thereafter use or refer to Manning Identification in advertising or promotion in any manner whatsoever, it being understood by Company that Manning Identification may be used at any time by others in connection with the advertisement and promotion of Products the shipment of which is completed after the termination of the Contract Period.

All rights to the use of such trademarks, logos or team identification must be acquired from the University of Tennessee, the Indianapolis Colts, the National Football League, or any other appropriate rights holder.\n\n      16.

Waiver.  The failure of either party at any time or times to demand strict performance by the other of any of the terms, covenants or conditions set forth herein shall not be construed as a continuing waiver or relinquishment thereof and each may at any time demand strict and complete performance by the other of said terms, covenants and conditions.\n\n      18.   Bankruptcy. If Company shall become bankrupt or insolvent, or if Company's business shall   be placed in the hands of a Receiver, Assignee or Trustee, whether by voluntary act of Company r otherwise, the Contract Period shall, at the option of Pey Dirt, immediately terminate.\n\n      19.   Assignment. This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of Pey Dirt and the successors and assigns of Pey Dirt.  Nothing herein shall prevent Pey Dirt from assigning the monetary benefits of this Agreement as it may so desire.  Further, inasmuch as it is recognized that Pey Dirt is the representative of Manning, Pey Dirt may at any time assign this Agreement to Manning and, in such event, Pey Dirt shall have no further obligation or liability in connection herewith and Pey Dirt's position vis-a-vis Company in connection herewith shall be in all respects the same as if Pey Dirt had signed this Agreement as agent rather than as principal from the beginning. The rights granted Company hereunder shall be used only by it and shall not, without the prior written consent of Pey Dirt, be transferred or assigned to any other.  In the event of the merger or consolidation of Company with any other entity, Pey Dirt shall have the right to terminate the Contract Period by so notifying Company in writing on or before sixty (60) days after Pey Dirt has received notice of such merger or consolidation.\n\n      20.

For purposes of the preceding sentence, Commencement of Production shall be defined as the production and delivery to the point of sale (refiner) by the Company (either directly or through a subsidiary) of not less than 4,000 ounces of gold within a 45 day period.

Closing of the subscription, purchase and sale shall be at such place and time as the Parties agree but not more than ten (10) days from delivery of the Financing Election. If HOC delivers the Financing Election, one or more of the HOC Entities shall pay the purchase price for, and the Company shall issue, additional Shares, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances. The Parties shall exchange representations and warranties, in form and in substance substantially similar to those provided in the Subscription Agreement and execute such documents as may be necessary to complete the subscription and sale of the Shares. In the event HOC fails to provide the Financing Election as set forth above, the Company shall be free to obtain such financing from one or more additional parties, free of any obligation to HOC.\n\nARTICLE 3  MARKET PURCHASES AND PRIVATE PURCHASES\n\n3.1 Market Purchases.Subject to compliance with applicable laws, the HOC Entities shall at any time and from time to time, in their sole discretion, be entitled to make purchases of the Company's common stock in the over-the-counter market or on any stock exchange on which its common stock is then quoted or listed (the Market Purchases); provided, however, that for a period of two (2) years following the Closing Date, unless the Parties otherwise agree, the HOC Entities do not beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more than forty percent (40%) of the Company's outstanding common stock on an undiluted basis, following any Market Purchase and any Private Agreement Purchase.

At the request of HOC, the Company shall introduce HOC to persons whom the Company believes may be interested in selling its common stock.\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE 4  PRE-EMPTIVE RIGHT\n\n4.1 HOC's Pre-emptive Right.\n\n(a) Subject to the provisions of subsection (g) of this Section 4.1 and Section 8.2 hereof, if at any time after the Closing Date, the Company proposes to issue or sell Equity Securities (Additional Securities) other than (i) under any Stock Option Plan, (ii) pursuant to the exercise of options under any Stock Option Plan, (iii) upon the exercise, exchange or conversion of any Convertible Securities, or (iv) for property other than money, the HOC Entities shall have the right to subscribe for and purchase Additional Securities, at the price at which such Additional Securities are offered for sale to other purchasers (the Other Purchasers), up to its Pro Rata Interest (as defined below) prior to giving effect to the issuance or sale of such Additional Securities. Pro Rata Interest means, at any relevant time, the ownership interest of HOC, expressed as a percentage, equal to: (i) the number of outstanding shares of common stock of the Company (Common Stock) beneficially owned by the HOC Entities, including all shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion, exercise or exchange of all Convertible Securities beneficially owned by the HOC Entities divided by (ii) the aggregate number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion, exercise or exchange of all outstanding Convertible Securities;\n\n(b) If the Company issues Equity Securities in circumstances that would not give rise to the rights of the HOC Entities pursuant to Section 4.1(a) (the Non-Participating Transaction), then in any concurrent or subsequent transaction which does give rise to the rights of the HOC Entities pursuant to Section 4.1(a) (the Participating Transaction), the Company shall allow the HOC Entities to subscribe for and purchase Additional Securities in an amount greater than HOC's Pro Rata Interest; provided that in the Participating Transaction, HOC shall not be entitled to purchase any more than its Pro Rata Interest of the securities sold collectively in the Non-Participating Transaction and the Participating Transaction.\n\n(c) If the Company intends to authorize and/or issue equity securities that give rise to the rights of HOC pursuant to Section 4.1(a), the Company shall provide notice to HOC (the Rights Notice) no less than ten (10) business days before the date on which the Company intends to issue equity securities giving rise to the rights of HOC in Section 4.1(a).\n\n(d) The Rights Notice shall specify sufficient information regarding the particulars of the issuance or sale of the Additional Securities to allow HOC to make a reasoned decision in respect of making the investment, including to the extent any such terms are determinable at such time: (i) the total number of equity securities outstanding as of the date thereof; (ii) the total number of Additional Securities which are being offered; (iii) the rights, privileges, restrictions, terms and conditions of such Additional Securities; (iv) the amount payable by HOC for the Additional Securities to which it is entitled pursuant to Section 4.1(a); and (v) the proposed closing date, and thereafter, to the extent it is not included in the Rights Notice, the Company shall immediately provide notice to HOC of such information as it is determined.\n\n(e) HOC shall give notice (an Acceptance Notice) to the Company not later than 5:00 p.m. (Denver time) on the tenth business day following the deemed receipt of any Rights Notice given under paragraph 4.1(c) setting out the number of Additional Securities, if any, which any of HOC Entities intends to subscribe for and purchase and, if applicable, the name and address of HOC Entity whose name in which such securities should be registered, provided that if HOC, acting reasonably, determines that it has insufficient information to make such investment decision, HOC shall notify the Company of the information required to make such investment decision and thereafter shall have the longer of (i) the remainder of the ten (10) Business Days set out in the first sentence of this paragraph; or (ii) two (2) Business Days from the receipt of such additional information to make the investment decision and deliver or refrain from delivering the Acceptance Notice. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Rights Notice shall be deemed to include sufficient information to make such investment decision if it includes the information specified in items (i) to (iv) of Section 4.1(d). If no Acceptance Notice has been provided to the Company within the required time, HOC will be deemed to have elected not to subscribe for or purchase any such Additional Securities.\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n(f) Following delivery of the Acceptance Notice, if any, the HOC Entities shall pay for, and the Company shall issue to the relevant HOC Entities, free and clear of any liens, the number of Additional Securities specified in the Acceptance Notice and, except as otherwise agreed, the Company shall provide HOC with substantially the same closing documents, including opinions, if applicable, as are delivered to the other persons subscribing for Additional Securities on the closing date for such issuance.\n\n(g) The rights granted to HOC under this Article 4 shall terminate and be of no further force or effect if HOC does not exercise Option and complete the purchase of the Additional Shares.\n\nARTICLE 5 BOARD REPRESENTATION\n\n5.1 Appointment of HOC Nominee. If, but only if HOC exercises the Option and completes the acquisition of the Additional Shares, HOC shall be entitled to nominate one (1) individual to the Board of Directors (the HOC Director). Upon receipt of such nomination and its satisfaction that the individual nominated by HOC meets the qualification requirements for directors under applicable laws, the Board of Directors further agrees to expand its membership to four (4) positions and appoint the individual nominated by HOC to the newly-created vacancy. The Board of Directors further agrees that if HOC maintains a Pro Rata Interest of at least 14.5%, it shall nominate such individual to the slate of directors at each subsequent annual meeting so long as the provisions of Section 8.2 are not invoked.\n\n5.2 Increase in Membership of the Board of Directors. If HOC acquires the Additional Shares and subsequently acquires additional Shares such that it holds a Pro Rata Interest of 40% or more, HOC shall be entitled to appoint one (1) additional individual to the Board of Directors. For greater clarity, if HOC exercises the Option and holds a Pro Rata Interest of at least 40%, HOC shall be entitled to appoint a total of two (2) individuals to the Board of Directors. Upon receipt of a nomination from HOC for the second director and its satisfaction that the individual meets the qualification requirements for directors under applicable law, the Board of Directors agrees to expand its membership to five positions and appoint the individual nominated by HOC to the newly created vacancy. The Board of Directors further agrees that so long as HOC maintains a Pro Rata Interest of at least 35%, it shall nominate such individual to the slate of directors at each subsequent annual meeting so long as the provisions of Section 8.2 are not invoked. The Company further agrees that if HOC exercises the Option and so long as the provisions of Section 8.2 are not invoked, it will not take any action to authorize and will cause the Board of Directors not to authorize any proposal to expand the Board beyond five (5) members without the advance written approval of HOC.\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Board Meetings. At all times when the provisions of Section 5.1 are satisfied, the Company shall provide HOC Director(s) not less than 7 (seven) Business Days advance written notice of the date on which any meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held. In providing such notice, the Company shall take into consideration the matters to be discussed at the meeting, the proximity to the place of the meeting and the time zone in which the HOC Director is resident.\n\n5.4 Resignation of HOC Director(s). If (x) one or both HOC Directors do not meet the individual qualifications for a director prescribed by applicable laws, (y) the Pro Rata Interest of HOC falls below 14.5%, or (z) the provisions of Section 8.2 hereof become applicable and the Company delivers notice to HOC to that effect, all of the HOC Directors shall forthwith resign; provided, however, that in the event of (x), HOC shall then be entitled to appoint an individual to replace the resigning director(s) and such resigning director(s) shall be afforded the benefits of any indemnity and insurance as may exist for all matters occurring prior to such resignation.\n\n5.5 Indemnification and Director's and Officer's Insurance. So long as HOC is entitled to nominate and maintain a director pursuant to this Article 5, the Company shall indemnify each current and former HOC Director and shall maintain director's and officer's liability insurance for the benefit of each such director, with the same rights and benefits as are accorded the directors of the Company generally.\n\nARTICLE 6  RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER\n\nThe provisions of this Article 6 shall apply if, but only if, HOC exercises the Option and acquires the Additional Shares and so long as the provisions of Section 8.2 do not apply:\n\n6.1 Joint Venture\n\n  (a) If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries decides to seek a joint venture partner to develop, acquire or otherwise earn an interest in any Properties including the Existing Properties, in circumstances where the Company's participation in such joint venture is not dependent on the participation of a particular third party as joint venture partner (such as in the case of an earn-in) (each a Proposed Joint Venture), the Company shall immediately provide notice to HOC (the Joint Venture Proposal Notice) specifying sufficient information regarding the particulars of the Proposed Joint Venture to allow HOC to make a reasoned decision in respect of participating in the Proposed Joint Venture, including to the extent any such terms are determinable at such time: (A) a description of the Property in respect of which the Proposed Joint Venture relates, and (B) the terms, including the purchase price, for the Proposed Joint Venture, and if applicable, a true copy of any related term sheet setting forth such terms.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.1 shall prevent the Company from concurrently negotiating with third parties with respect to those matters set out in this Section 6.1.\n\n  (b) If HOC, acting reasonably, determines that the Joint Venture Proposal Notice contains insufficient information to make a reasoned decision in respect of participating in the Proposed Joint Venture, it shall notify the Company of the information required to make such decision and thereafter shall have the greater of (i) five (5) Business Days from the receipt of such information from the Company, and (ii) the days remaining in the period specified in Section 6.2 to make such decision and deliver or refrain from delivering the HOC JV Acceptance Notice in accordance with such Section 6.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a copy of the term sheet for the Proposed Joint Venture shall be deemed to be sufficient information to make such reasoned decision, if it includes the information specified in Section 6.1(a).\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2 Joint Venture Proposal\n\n  (a) Receipt of the Joint Venture Proposal Notice by HOC shall be deemed to constitute an invitation to HOC Entities to participate in the Proposed Joint Venture.\n\n  (b) If any of HOC Entities provides the Company an acceptance (the HOC JV Acceptance Notice) in writing in respect of the Joint Venture Proposal Notice, within fifteen (15) Business Days of receipt thereof or such shorter period as may be specified in the Joint Venture Proposal Notice of a determination in respect of the Proposed Joint Venture, the Company shall negotiate exclusively in good faith with HOC to finalize terms of the Proposed Joint Venture acceptable to each of the Parties, acting reasonably, within a period of sixty days or such additional period as the Parties may from time to time agree in writing (the JV Negotiation Period), failing which the Company shall be entitled to pursue other partners for the Proposed Joint Venture. If HOC does not provide HOC JV Acceptance Notice to the Company within fifteen (15) Business Days or such shorter period as may be specified in the Joint Venture Proposal Notice, of receiving of the Joint Venture Proposal Notice, the Company may enter into negotiations with any other person regarding the Proposed Joint Venture. If the Company truncates the period during which the HOC JV Acceptance Notice is required to be returned by HOC, it shall include in the Joint Venture Proposal Notice a statement certified by an officer of the Company that the Company has determined that it is necessary to truncate such period to avoid losing the opportunity to make such acquisition or other related transaction and that it has used commercially reasonable efforts to avoid truncating such period.\n\nARTICLE 7  STANDSTILL\n\nThe provisions of this Article 7 shall apply if HOC acquires the Additional Shares and for a period of two (2) years after the Subsequent Closing Date:\n\n7.1 Standstill\n\n  (a) HOC covenants and agrees that, except as otherwise contemplated in this Agreement, HOC will not, and will not allow any HOC Entities to, in either case, without the prior written consent of the Company, directly or indirectly:\n\n  (i) acquire or enter into any agreement to acquire or make any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner any equity securities of the Company (whether issued or unissued) that would result in a Pro Rata Interest greater than 40% other than (A) as a result of a stock dividend or distribution made by or a recapitalization of the Company, (B) in accordance with the terms of any dividend reinvestment or share purchase plan made available from time to time by the Company to holders of equity securities; (C) pursuant to the exercise of rights issued pursuant to a rights offering made by the Company to the holders of its equity securities; or (D) pursuant to the exercise of rights issued pursuant to any shareholder rights plan of the Company and attached to equity securities;\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n  (ii) assist, encourage or advise any other person to acquire or agree to acquire in any manner any equity securities;\n\n  (iii) propose or support or engage in any discussions or negotiations with respect to, or enter into any agreement, commitment or understanding with any third party to effect, any tender offer, merger, business combination, asset or share transaction, financing transaction or corporate restructuring involving the Company;\n\n  (iv) make or participate directly or indirectly in any solicitation of proxies from shareholders of the Company;\n\n  (v) form, join or in any way participate in any group acting jointly or in concert with any of the foregoing;

or\n\n11\n\n  B) any acquisition (excluding a Tender Offer Transaction), merger, asset purchase and sale, business combination\n\n\n\n\n\n  B) any acquisition (excluding a Tender Offer Transaction), merger, asset purchase and sale, business combination transaction or other extraordinary transaction involving or relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or an intention to make an offer to the Company and/or its subsidiaries to undertake such a transaction, by any person or group of persons (other than any HOC Entities) which would, if completed, result in (I) any class of outstanding equity securities being converted into cash or securities of another person resulting in shareholders holding less than 50% of the equity and/or voting securities of the resulting entity; or (II) all or substantially all of the Company's assets being sold to any person or group of persons (other than any HOC Entities) (a Business Combination Transaction), provided that in the case of this Section 6.1(b)(ii)(B) HOC must make such Acquisition Proposal confidentially to the Board of Directors and not by way of public offer to the shareholders.\n\n  For greater certainty, if HOC has commenced an Acquisition Proposal in reliance on this Section 6.1(b)(ii) or in respect of Section 6.1(b)(ii)(B), has agreed with the Company to an Acquisition Proposal, prior to the withdrawal or cancellation of such Tender Offer Transaction or Business Combination Transaction, HOC shall not be precluded from continuing with such Acquisition Proposal by reason only of the withdrawal or cancellation of any relevant Tender Offer Transaction or Business Combination Transaction; or\n\n  (iii) if a person or group of persons other than any of the HOC Entities, the Company or its subsidiaries obtains proxies carrying a majority of the votes attached to all outstanding voting securities of the Company and exercises such votes to replace the Board of Directors.\n\n7.2 Most Favored Nation.

The Company shall provide such geologist with room and board while such geologist is on-site at any of the Existing Properties. HOC, however, shall be responsible for payment of any compensation for such geologist. Other consulting services which may be required by the Company, including metallurgical, underground mining engineering or concentrate contract negotiations, may be requested from HOC, and provided that HOC agrees to deliver those services, any charges for such services shall be billed by HOC to the Company at no more than HOC's actual cost plus 1%.\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2 Termination of Certain HOC Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event (i) HOC shall hold a Pro Rata Interest less than 14.5% or (ii) HOC shall have achieved a Pro Rata Interest greater than 14.5% but subsequently sells or otherwise disposes of 20% or more of its Pro Rata Interest in any one or more transactions, the benefits provided to HOC pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.3 (Additional Financing), Article 4 (Pre-Emptive Rights), Article 5 (Board Representation), Article 6 (First Offer) and Section 8.1 (Designation of Geologist) above shall immediately terminate and be of no further force or effect.

If HOC makes a proposal to amend this Agreement to increase the purchase price payable for the Additional Shares, such that the proposal of such other Person shall no longer be a Superior Proposal, and shall complete the purchase of the Additional Shares upon such terms, then neither the Company nor its subsidiaries shall enter into such Alternative Proposal.\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n  (c) The Company shall comply with all securities regulatory filing requirements on a timely basis in connection with the issuance of any Equity Securities of the Company to any HOC Entity, including filing within the periods stipulated under Securities Laws, at the Company's expense, all private placement forms required to be filed by the Company and paying all filing fees required to be paid in connection therewith so that such issuance may lawfully occur without the necessity of filing a prospectus, registration statement or any similar document under the Securities Laws.\n\n  (d) The Company shall, to the extent and for so long as HOC Entities hold at least 14.5% of the Shares on a non-diluted basis, upon HOC's request, permit representatives of the HOC Entities to have access to the site and any of the premises where the business and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries are conducted and access and duplicating rights (and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause persons or firms possessing such documentation or information to give similar access and duplicating rights) to the Company and its Subsidiaries' books of account and records and such other documents, communications, items and matters, within the knowledge, possession or control of the Company, which HOC may reasonably request, at HOC's own cost (other than those it is permitted to examine and make copies of free of charge pursuant to applicable Laws) provided that, except to the extent the information can be provided in the necessary course of business of the Company, acting reasonably including to provide HOC Entities with information to assist the HOC Entities and their advisors with the preparation of the financial statements for such HOC Entities, nothing herein shall require the Company to provide HOC Entities with any information which would constitute a material fact with respect to the Company which has not been generally disclosed.\n\n  (e) In the event the Company shall breach any representation or warranty, covenant or any other right of HOC under this Agreement in any material respect, including but not limited to, the rights afforded to HOC under Articles 2, 4, 5, 6 and 8 hereof, then at the request of HOC, the Company shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-l or S-3 (or, if Form S-l or S-3 is not then available, on such form of registration statement as is then available to effect a registration for resale of the Purchase Shares and the Additional Shares (Registration Statement)), covering the resale of all of the Shares owned by HOC; provided, however, that if prior to the filing of the Registration Statement, the provisions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 1933 Act) allow the sale of all of the Shares in compliance with that Rule, the Company shall not be obligated to file such Registration Statement so long as the Company at its own expense, does the following: (i) complies with any necessary filing or reporting requirements (under the 1933 Act or otherwise) to permit such sale, (ii) cooperates with HOC in removing any legend on the certificates representing the Shares, including but not limited to instructing its transfer agent to remove such restrictive legend and (iii) provides HOC with an opinion of counsel confirming that such sale is permitted under Rule 144. Such Registration Statement also shall cover, to the extent allowable under the 1933 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder (including Rule 416), such indeterminate number of additional shares of Common Stock resulting from stock splits, stock dividends or similar transactions with respect to the Shares. The Company shall pay all expenses associated with the registration, including filing and printing fees, counsel and accounting fees and expenses, and State Blue Sky fees and expenses. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC as soon as practicable. The Company shall notify HOC by facsimile or e-mail as promptly as practicable, and in any event, within three (3) business days, after the Registration Statement is declared effective and shall simultaneously provide HOC with copies of any related prospectus to be used in connection with the sale or other disposition of the securities covered thereby.\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\n  (f) In connection with the foregoing, the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless HOC against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which it may become subject under the 1933 Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any other public filing by the Company, so long as such statement has not been provided to the Company by HOC for inclusion in such registration statement; (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, so long as such omission or alleged omission does not relate to HOC or the manner of sale for the Shares as provided to the Company by HOC; or (iii) any violation of the 1933 Act, any rule or regulation thereunder or any other securities law, rule or regulation applicable to the Company and relating to the action or inaction required of the Company in connection therewith.

Such Transfer Addendum shall:\n\n(i) include a plan and budget for the conduct of the Process Transfer and/or establishment of such Capacity, which shall include amounts charged by the CMO (as defined further below, the Alternate Supplier) to receive and conduct such Process Transfer and/or establish such Capacity, as well as reasonable FTE costs for Sutro personnel performing and managing technology transfer activities in accordance with the Transfer Addendum\u00b7\n\n(ii) require SutroVax to fund the costs incurred by Sutro to conduct Process Transfer and/or establish such Capacity in accordance with such budget;\n\n(iii) provide for initiation and completion of the Process Transfer and establishment of Capacity as requested by SutroVax, to the extent possible;\n\n(iv) to the extent requested by SutroVax, be designed to enable the Alternate Supplier to Manufacture Extract of suitable quality for use in Phase 3 clinical trials and commercialization of a Vaccine Composition at a capacity to support SutroVax' projected commercial requirements for Extract (or other capacity identified by SutroVax in connection with the negotiation of the Transfer Addendum), as requested by SutroVax;\n\n(v) require the Parties to fully cooperate to verify that the Extract supplied by the Alternate Supplier meets the Specifications, to validate the Manufacturing process implemented at the Alternate Supplier and to qualify the Alternate Supplier, in each case to supply Extract for SutroVax' use in Phase 3 clinical trials and commercialization of a Vaccine Composition (collectively, with respect to Capacity established, Validating such Capacity);\n\n\n\n\n\n(vi) include mechanisms for keeping SutroVax fully informed, at scheduled intervals not to exceed once per quarter, of the progress of the Process Transfer and establishing such Capacity, as applicable, including with respect to the anticipated date for qualifying the Alternate Supplier and any changes to such anticipated date;\n\n(vii) provide a right for SutroVax to modify the timing of or terminate the Process Transfer, Capacity or specified aspects thereof on reasonable notice, subject to SutroVax' agreement to bear any resulting termination or cancellation fees charged by the Alternative Supplier; and\n\n(viii) include a mechanism for Sutro to cooperate with SutroVax and keep SutroVax reasonably informed with respect to Sutro's negotiation of an agreement with a potential Alternate Supplier for a Process Transfer and/or establishment of Capacity, including with respect to pricing for Extract from the Alternate Supplier to Sutro and any commitments to purchase quantities of Extract from the Alternate Supplier that SutroVax would be obligated to assume (e.g., in connection with establishing Capacity), if any, and require Sutro to obtain SutroVax' approval (not to be withheld unreasonably) of the terms of such agreement prior to entering into such agreement to the extent that the terms apply to SutroVax (it being understood that Sutro may redact any terms that are not relevant to SutroVax).\n\n(b) Scope. As used above, Process Transfer means a technology transfer of Sutro's know-how and information as is necessary or useful for the Third Party CMO to Manufacture in its own facilities Extract that meets SutroVax' requirements, including any such information and know-how as would be needed for such CMO to scale up such Manufacture to the requested commercial volumes. To establish Capacity means that the CMO would take such actions as are necessary (including validation and if necessary adapting or reserving existing facilities, establishing new facilities and/or procuring necessary equipment) to Manufacture Extract meeting SutroVax' requirements for Phase 3 and commercial supply in such quantities as SutroVax designates. It is understood that SutroVax may request that the Process Transfer and establishment of Capacity be undertaken in separate steps, for example by undertaking an initial Process Transfer to demonstrate the CMO's ability to Manufacture Extract, and then later establishing Capacity for Phase 3 and commercial supply, as requested by SutroVax in accordance with Section 2.15.1(a) (i.e., in separate requests).\n\n(c) Selection of Alternate Supplier. The Alternate Supplier will be selected by Sutro, provided that Sutro must select an Alternate Supplier that is substantially similar to those CMOs identified on Schedule 2.15.1 hereto and provided further that SutroVax shall have the right to veto such selection based only on a genuine and material conflict of interest between SutroVax and the Alternate Supplier. Additional CMOs may be added to Schedule 2.15.1 by Sutro with SutroVax's approval (not to be withheld unreasonably).\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Alternate Supplier as Subcontractor. It is understood that the Alternate Supplier established under the Transfer Addendum shall operate as a subcontractor of Sutro under this Supply Agreement and the Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement, and as such SutroVax will order from Sutro thereunder any Extract to be Manufactured by such Alternate Supplier. Subject to the foregoing, the Transfer Addendum and the Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement will include reasonable and customary rights for SutroVax to conduct audits/inspections, site visits, quarterly meetings, each such audit/inspection, site visit and quarterly meeting to be coordinated by Sutro and to occur in the presence of a representative for Sutro and SutroVax, in connection with the Alternate Supplier's manufacture of Extract for supply to SutroVax. For clarity, SutroVax shall not conduct any business discussions for the supply of Extract with the Alternate Supplier in a manner that induces the Alternate Supplier to breach its agreement with Sutro. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Sutro undergoes a Change of Control or Sutro permits any third party to acquire Extract directly from an Alternate Supplier established under the Transfer Addendum, then SutroVax shall thereafter have the right to establish a supply agreement with and obtain supply of Extract directly from such Alternate Supplier.\n\n(e) Quotations. Upon SutroVax's request (which request, for clarity, may be before a request to negotiate a Transfer Addendum), Sutro shall seek quotations from one or more Third Party CMO(s) for such a Process Transfer and/or establishment of such Capacity, in each case as requested by SutroVax, and the Parties shall reasonably cooperate to establish requests for quotations for such purposes.\n\n(f) Arbitration. If the Parties have not agreed upon a Transfer Addendum within [***] after SutroVax' request, upon SutroVax' request by written notice to Sutro, the terms and conditions of the Transfer Addendum shall be determined by binding arbitration in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 11.4. For clarity, however, it is understood that a Transfer Addendum shall not include any provision granting to SutroVax or its Affiliates or Sublicens.ee s any right to obtain or use any Sutro Core Know-How.\n\n2.15.2 Source of Supply. It is understood that after the Alternate Supplier is qualified, SutroVax shall have the right under this Supply Agreement and the Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement to specify whether Extract ordered from Sutro pursuant to this Agreement or the Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement will be Manufactured at Sutro's Facility or at the Alternate Supplier's facilities (and to the extent Extract from the Alternate Supplier is ordered under this Supply Agreement or the Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement, the facility of the Alternate Supplier shall be deemed a Facility for purposes of this Supply Agreement and the Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent the FDA and EMA have confirmed that Extract manufactured at Sutro's Facility and the Alternate Supplier's Facility are interchangeable and can be supplied from either such Facility without any additional regulatory requirements or regulatory delay with respect to the applicable Vaccine Composition, and such Extract otherwise meets SutroVax' requirements, then with SutroVax' consent (not to be withheld unreasonably) Sutro may supply Extract from either Sutro's Facility or the Alternate Supplier's Facility.\n\n2.15.3 Price. To the extent Sutro or its Affiliate Manufactures Extract supplied to SutroVax, the Price (per unit volume or unit weight) under this Supply Agreement and the Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement for such Extract shall not exceed [***] of the Fully Burdened Manufacturing Costs of such Extract; and to the extent the Extract to be supplied to SutroVax is Manufactured by a Third Party (including the Alternate Supplier), the Price to be\n\n\n\n\n\ncharged to SutroVax under this Supply Agreement and the Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement for such Extract shall equal the amount Sutro paid such Third Party for such Extract (OOP Cost) plus an amount reasonably calculated to cover Sutro's FTE costs to procure and manage the relationship with such Third Party, such amount not to exceed [***] of the OOP Cost for such Extract. To the extent that Sutro or its Affiliate receives any portion of the amounts paid to such Third Party to Manufacture Extract (e.g., as a profit share or otherwise), the Price to be charged SutroVax shall be the lesser of i) [***], or ii) [***]; in either case, [***]. For clarity, Section 3.4 of the License Agreement shall apply with respect to the Alternate Supplier.\n\n2.15.4 Sutro/Third Party use of Alternate Supplier. Once the Alternate Supplier is qualified pursuant to this Section 2.15, SutroVax shall have the first right (as between SutroVax and Sutro or Third Parties supplied or authorized by Sutro) to obtain Extract Manufactured by the Alternate Supplier up to the Capacity established pursuant to the Transfer Addendum for a period ending the later of [***] or [***], and provided SutroVax commits to [***] or [***].\n\n2.16 Other Extracts. From time-to-time, subject to an agreed-upon Work Order, SutroVax may place purchase orders for quantities of research grade extract derived from strains of E. Coli other than that set forth on Schedule 1 attached hereto (each an Other Extract). Sutro shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to accept such purchase orders (and shall accept such purchase orders placed consistent with an agreed-upon Work Order) and manufacture and supply to SutroVax such Other Extracts. For the purpose of calculating the Price for Other Extracts in accordance with this Section, the Price will be the cost of materials and Sutro's labor at an FTE rate of [***] per year for Sutro laboratory scientists. Upon Sutro's acceptance of a purchase order for Other Extract, such Other Extract in such purchase order shall be deemed Extract for purposes of Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4.1 (solely with respect to the last two sentences thereof), 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9.1 , 3.1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9.\n\n2.17 Manufacture of Custom Reagents. For clarity, SutroVax may Manufacture Custom Reagents itself or obtain supply thereof through a Third Party independent of this Supply Agreement and nothing in this Supply Agreement is intended to restrict SutroVax from doing so. Upon SutroVax's request, and subject to the remainder of the terms of this Section 2.17, Sutro shall (a) transfer to SutroVax or a contract manufacturer designated by SutroVax (which contract manufacturer is reasonably acceptable to Sutro, the approval of which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditions or delayed by Sutro) as soon as reasonably practicable the process to Manufacture each Custom Reagent and the items of Sutro Know-How reasonably necessary for SutroVax or its designee to Manufacture each Custom Reagent, including cell lines, standard operating procedures, protocols, batch records, analytical method standard operating procedures and analytical method transfer protocols and (b) make Sutro Personnel reasonably available to SutroVax or its designee for scientific and technical explanations and on-site support that may reasonably be requested by SutroVax or its designee to Manufacture the Custom Reagents; provided however, that SutroVax shall fully reimburse Sutro for all documented time spent by Sutro's personnel to perform such transfer (on an FTE basis, each such FTE charged at an annual rate of [***]) and out-of-pocket costs incurred by Sutro in connection with all of the activities under the preceding sub-clauses (a) and (b), in accordance with a budget reasonably approved in advance by SutroVax. Upon such SutroVax request, Sutro and SutroVax shall, within [***] days, agree on a scope of work for such transfer, including\n\n\n\n\n\nscale, timeline, estimated budget, and required materials; both parties shall use reasonable efforts to complete the transfer as soon as reasonably practical. If requested by SutroVax (including if such request is prior to agreement on a scope of work), Sutro shall promptly transfer to SutroVax or its designee the cell lines, manufacturing instructions and analytical methods used for Manufacture of each Custom Reagent. For clarity, SutroVax shall have the right to enter into an agreement directly with such designee for the Manufacture and supply of Custom Reagents directly to SutroVax, its Affiliates, and any SutroVax CMO and, upon SutroVax's request, to the extent necessary, Sutro shall authorize such designee to enter into such agreement with SutroVax and perform such activities. For further clarity, Sutro shall not be responsible for any damages resulting from delay or failure in establishing the processes for Manufacture of Custom Reagents at SutroVax's designee resulting from action or inaction on the part of the designee or to the extent beyond Sutro's control. SutroVax shall have the right to obtain from such designee such items of Sutro Know-How transferred to such designee and use such items in connection with the exercise of its rights pursuant to the License Agreement, including for the Manufacture of Custom Reagents and the management of such designee. SutroVax shall use such Sutro Know-How transferred under this Section 2.17 (to the extent it is Discloser's Information of Sutro and does not meet one or more the criteria in clause (a) through (e) of Section 10.1 of the License Agreement) only for the Manufacture of Custom Reagents or otherwise within the scope of rights and licenses granted SutroVax in the License Agreement. In case of such a transfer to SutroVax or its designee, SutroVax will share with Sutro (i) the proposed process for manufacture of Custom Reagents through a Third Party so that Sutro may provide feedback and ensure that the process and Specifications are consistent with Sutro's process, and (ii) all regulatory submissions (including DMFs with respect to Custom Reagents) at least [***] days in advance of their intended date of submission to a Regulatory Authority in the Territory, and shall take into account Sutro's feedback to ensure alignment with Sutro's regulatory submissions and Regulatory Approvals with respect to Custom Reagents. Following completion of the transfer set forth above, Sutro shall provide reasonable support for the use of Third Party Custom Reagents in conjunction with Extract supplied by or on behalf of Sutro. In addition, Extract supplied by Sutro that conforms to the Required Standards when tested with Custom Reagents supplied by Sutro but not with Custom Reagents manufactured under this Section shall be deemed to conform to the Required Standards and SutroVax may not reject such Extract as a result of such non-conformance to the Required Standards when tested with Custom Reagents. SutroVax shall not prevent Sutro from separately contracting with the contract manufacturer for Manufacture of Custom Reagents for use on its own behalf or on behalf of other third parties.\n\n2.18 Sutro Core Know-How. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, except as set forth in Section 15.3 of the License Agreement, in no event shall SutroVax, its Affiliates or Sublicensees have the right to access any Sutro Core Know-How (as defined in the License Agreement), whether directly from Sutro or its Affiliates or through a CMO or otherwise, and SutroVax, its Affiliates and Sublicensees shall not require, request or solicit any CMO to deliver any Sutro Core Know-How to SutroVax, its Affiliates and/or its Sublicensees, and no agreement between any CMO and Sutro, its Affiliates and Subsidiaries shall contain any provision granting to SutroVax or its Affiliates or Sublicensees any right to obtain or use any Sutro Core Know-How. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any item of Sutro Core Know-How is delivered to SutroVax, its Affiliates and/or its Sublicensees (except as set forth in Section 15.3 of the License Agreement), SutroVax, its Affiliates and Sublicensees shall immediately return such item to Sutro. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent SutroVax or any of its Affiliates\n\n\n\n\n\nor Sublicensees is required by a Regulatory Authority (or Applicable Law) in the United States, Europe or Japan to confidentially disclose, as part of the applicable regulatory filings with respect to a Vaccine Composition, any Sutro Core Know-How (for clarity, excluding any tangible embodiments of such Sutro Core Know-How other than information and documentation), Sutro shall, upon SutroVax's written request, confidentially disclose such Sutro Core Know-How as part of the applicable regulatory filings, subject to the payment obligations set forth in Section 5.4 of the License Agreement.\n\n2.19 Express Rights. Except as expressly set forth in this Supply Agreement, no rights or licenses are granted to SutroVax under this Supply Agreement.\n\n2.20 Extract Requirements. SutroVax agrees to purchase all its requirements of Extract from Sutro in accordance with this Agreement, except to the extent SutroVax is allowed to purchase Extract from (a) Alternate Suppliers engaged by Sutro in accordance with Section 2.15 of this Agreement; (b) a CMO engaged or established and authorized by Sutro under Section 3.l(d) of the License Agreement; or (c) a CMO authorized by Sutro under Section 3.l(e) of the License Agreement. Manufacturing of Extracts in breach of this Section 2.20 shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement and the License Agreement by SutroVax.\n\nARTICLE 3 PRICING AND PAYMENT\n\n3.1 Invoices. Sutro shall invoice SutroVax at the time of each shipment of Product(s) for the Price for such shipment. SutroVax will pay such invoices within [***] days of receipt of invoice (including all required documentation) by SutroVax.\n\n3.2 Prices. The Prices for the Products shall not exceed [***] of the Fully Burdened Manufacturing Costs of such Product at the time such Product is manufactured and shall be set forth in the applicable Work Order. Upon SutroVax's request from time-to-time, Sutro shall disclose to SutroVax the then- current Price for Product. The Price for the Products as of the Effective Date is set forth in Schedule 1.\n\n3.3 Recordkeeping. During the Term and for [***] years thereafter, or for such longer period as may be required by Applicable Law, Sutro shall prepare and retain, and shall cause its subcontractors to prepare and retain, accurate books and records related to transactions made pursuant to this Supply Agreement and Prices. Such records shall be made available for reasonable review, audit and inspection upon reasonable notice and with reasonable frequency, upon SutroVax's request for the purpose of verifying Sutro's calculations of amounts due hereunder, the basis for such calculations (including Sutro's calculation of the Fully Burdened Manufacturing Costs) or payments and Sutro's compliance with the terms and conditions of this Supply Agreement. Audits and inspections may be conducted by SutroVax's own personnel or retained consultant(s), subject to the confidentiality obligations set forth in this Supply Agreement.\n\n3.4 Taxes. The Prices are exclusive of all Taxes. SutroVax will pay all taxes and duties that are assessed by any national, federal, state or local governmental authority on SutroVax's purchase or use of the Products, including, without limitation, sales, use, excise, value-added and withholding taxes, but excluding any taxes based on Sutro's income or gross receipts (collectively, Taxes). Sutro will separately identify all such Taxes on Sutro's invoice.\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE 4 PRODUCT TESTING\n\n4.1 Product Testing and Inspections. Each shipment of Product shall be accompanied by a certificate of analysis describing all current requirements of the Specifications and results of tests performed on such Product and a certificate of conformity certifying that the quantities of Product supplied have been Manufactured, controlled and released according to the Required Standards (COA/COC) as set forth in the applicable Quality Agreement (subject to SutroVax's conduct of the SutroVax Activity Test to confirm Extract meets the SutroVax Activity Criteria). The COA/COC acceptance criteria for each Product shall be set forth in the Specification for such Product. Two of the tests and corresponding COA/COC acceptance criteria for the Extract shall be the performance of a productivity (Activity) test of the applicable Sutro protein (the Sutro Activity Test and Sutro Activity Criteria) and the performance of a productivity (activity) test of the applicable Vaccine Composition (the SutroVax Activity Test and SutroVax Activity Criteria). Sutro shall perform the Sutro Activity Test to confirm that all shipments of Extract meet the Sutro Activity Criteria and SutroVax (or its designee) shall perform the SutroVax Activity Test to confirm that all shipments of Extract meet the SutroVax Activity Criteria. Sutro will also provide SutroVax with Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) or an equivalent instrument recognized by the applicable Regulatory Authority as required for the Product(s), and updates of the same as necessary.\n\n4.2 Acceptance/Rejection of Non-Conforming Goods. SutroVax or its designee shall have a period of [***] calendar days from the date of delivery of the Product(s) in accordance with Section 2.6 and the COA/COCs or the equivalent instrument recognized by the applicable Regulatory Authority for such Product(s) (Acceptance Period), to inspect any shipment of Product(s) and conduct the SutroVax Activity Test to determine whether such shipment conforms to the Required Standards. If SutroVax determines that the Product(s) do not conform to the Required Standards, it hall notify Sutro within the Acceptance Period, and, if requested by Sutro, SutroVax shall ship a sample of such non-conforming Product(s) to Sutro at Sutro's expense. SutroVax's failure to notify Sutro of the non-conformity within the Acceptance Period will be deemed for purposes of this Supply Agreement to constitute SutroVax's acceptance of such shipment, provided, however, that such acceptance shall be subject to SutroVax's right to reject Product(s) until [***] days from the delivery date of the applicable Product, in each case, due to discovery by SutroVax or SutroVax's Affiliates or designees that the applicable Product does not conform to the Required Standards and such non-conformance could not reasonably be discovered within the Acceptance Period (Latent Defects) provided that SutroVax gives Sutro with written notice of such Latent Defect within [***] days of SutroVax or any SutroVax Affiliate or designee becoming aware of such defect.\n\n4.3 Disputes Regarding Conformance to Required Standards. If Sutro does not agree with SutroVax's determination that Product fails to conform to the Required Standards, then Sutro shall so notify SutroVax in writing within [***] days of its receipt of SutroVax's notice of non-conformity with respect to such Product and (if requested) Product sample. Sutro and SutroVax shall use reasonable efforts to resolve such disagreement as promptly as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout limiting the foregoing, Sutro and SutroVax shall discuss in good faith mutually acceptable testing procedures pursuant to which both Sutro and SutroVax will re-test a sample of the disputed Product to determine whether such Product meets the Required Standards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Sutro and SutroVax are unable to resolve such disagreement within [***] days of the date of the applicable rejection notice, either Party may submit a sample of the allegedly non-conforming Product for testing and a determination as to whether or not such Product conforms to the Required Standards to an independent testing organization, or to a consultant of recognized repute within the United States pharmaceutical industry, in either case mutually agreed upon by the Parties (such organization or consultant, the Laboratory), the appointment of which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed by either Party. The determination of the Laboratory with respect to all or part of any shipment of Product shall be final and binding upon the Parties. The fees and expenses of the Laboratory making such determination shall be borne by Sutro, in the event that the Laboratory determines that the Product was non-conforming and by SutroVax, in the event that the Laboratory determines that the Product did conform to the Required Standards.\n\n4.4 Return and Replacement of Non-Conforming Goods. Product that is either rejected by SutroVax as not meeting the Required Standards, or that is determined by the Laboratory not to meet such Required Standards, shall, [***], be returned by SutroVax to Sutro, or destroyed pursuant to Applicable Law, at Sutro's reasonable expense. Sutro shall replace any non-conforming Product(s) within the shortest possible time. SutroVax shall have no responsibility to Sutro for the amounts invoiced for non-conforming Product(s), and shall be credited for any amounts paid, but shall pay Sutro the applicable Price for the replacement Product(s) under the terms of Section 3.1.\n\nARTICLE 5 INSPECTION\n\n5.1 Right to Audit. During the Term and the [***] period thereafter, SutroVax or a SutroVax Affiliate may, during normal working hours and upon reasonable advance notice perform site audits and inspect, or request information relating to, Sutro's or its subcontractor's Facilities and records directly or indirectly involved in the performance of this Supply Agreement or related to the Product(s). Such requests should be made in writing and Sutro will allow for such audits or inspection to occur within [***] days from request (excepting for cause audits) for Sutro's Facilities and within [***] days' from request (excepting for cause audits) for Sutro's subcontractor's facilities. Reasonable advance notice for audits for cause shall not require more than [***] advance notice. During such an inspection or request for information the inspectors may inquire about the progress of the work being carried out by Sutro or its subcontractor, and are in particular but not exclusively authorized to:\n\n5.1.1 Inspect the Facilities, documents and equipment used, or to be used, in the Manufacture of the Product(s);\n\n5.1.2 Verify the qualifications of the employees and subcontractors carrying out such work and their use of the relevant equipment;\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.3 Evaluate all scientific techniques used by Sutro, its subcontractors and their respective employees in the performance of this Supply Agreement and the procedures used in the creation and storage of samples of the Product(s), provided that nothing in this Section 5.1.3 shall require Sutroto disclose any Sutro Core Know-How;\n\n5.1.4 Verify and evaluate information relating to the utilization of the Manufacturing capacity of Sutro's Facilities or its subcontractor's Facilities;\n\n5.1.5 Review correspondence, reports, filings and other documents from Regulatory Authorities to the extent related to the Manufacturing activities hereunder;\n\n5.1.6 Evaluate the implementation of all Manufacturing and process changes made with respect to the Product, including pursuant to any corrective action plan; and\n\n5.1.7 Ascertain compliance with Applicable Laws, the Specifications and this Supply Agreement.\n\n5.2 Access. Sutro shall provide SutroVax's and its Affiliate's and Sublicensee's inspectors with access to its Facilities, and information related to such Facilities, in order that the inspectors may carry out the inspections or inquiries referred to in the provisions of this Article 5. For the avoidance of doubt, neither SutroVax nor any of its Affiliates or Sublicensees (or their respective inspectors) shall have the right to observe the Manufacture of the Extract or be present at Sutro and its subcontractors' Facilities at such times when Extract is being Manufactured. Sutro shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain from its subcontractors commitments similar to those contemplated in this Section 5.2. Audits and inspections may be conducted by SutroVax's own personnel or retained consultant(s), subject to the confidentiality obligations set forth in this Supply Agreement.\n\n5.3 Sutro Audits. Without limiting the foregoing; Sutro is responsible for auditing the facilities of the suppliers of Components, if any, periodically, and Sutro agrees to provide SutroVax, upon SutroVax's request with a current copy of the audit report of such facilities and to incorporate SutroVax's comments with respect to any corrective action plan related to the Product.\n\nARTICLE 6 REGULATORY AND QUALITY RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n6.1 Regulatory Responsibilities. Sutro shall obtain and maintain any and all regulatory and governmental permits, licenses and approvals that are necessary for Sutro to Manufacture the Product(s) for SutroVax or its Affiliates in accordance with the terms of this Supply Agreement and Applicable Law. As between the Parties, SutroVax shall have the sole responsibility for all Regulatory Approvals of the Vaccine Compositions.\n\n6.2 Right of Reference; Drug Master Files. Sutro shall (a) file Drug Master File(s) for the Products with the FDA as requested by SutroVax, and with Regulatory Authorities in the European Union (including the United Kingdom) and Japan in accordance with timelines to be mutually agreed upon (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld by either Party) (provided at SutroVax's request, Sutro shall do so within [***] of SutroVax's request using\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulatory Filings that comprise versions of the DMF(s) filed with the FDA that have been reformatted to comply with EU and Japanese requirements), and (b) provide the appropriate authorizations to such Regulatory Authority(ies) allowing the Regulatory Authority the right to review and SutroVax or its designee to reference such Drug Master File(s) in support of (and other Regulatory Materials, to the extent necessary to support) an application for Regulatory Approval submitted by SutroVax (or its permitted designee) for any Vaccine Composition produced using the Product the subject of the applicable Drug Master File (it being understood that SutroVax, its Affiliates\u00b7 and Sublicensees shall not have access to the information contained in such Drug Master Files (or other confidential Regulatory Materials submitted for a similar purpose as a Drug Master File (e.g., a clinical trial application for such purpose in the European Union)) as a result of such authorization and right to reference). Sutro shall file such Drug Master File in coordination with SutroVax's efforts to file and prosecute the applicable regulatory filings to such Regulatory Authority and Sutro shall be responsible, at SutroVax's sole expense (subject to a budget reasonably approved in advance by SutroVax), for providing the applicable Regulatory Authorities with such additional data as they may request (which may in some cases require Sutro to conduct additional studies), and for correcting any deficiencies of such Drug Master File identified by such Regulatory Authority, in each case in a reasonably prompt and efficient manner so as to prevent any delay in obtaining Regulatory Approvals for any Vaccine Composition based on such Drug Master File. In addition, Sutro shall be responsible for maintaining such Drug Master File in accordance with applicable Laws as necessary to support filing and prosecuting the applicable regulatory filing(s) and obtaining and maintaining the applicable Regulatory Approval(s) for Vaccine Compositions produced using the Products. For further clarity, to the extent Sutro discloses. Sutro Know- How to SutroVax, SutroVax shall have the right to include (and authorize the inclusion of) such Sutro Know-How in Regulatory Materials to the extent it is necessary or useful for the purpose of obtaining Regulatory Approval of a Vaccine Composition. Sutro's obligations under this Section 6.2 shall [***]. Sutro shall cause its personnel to record time spent performing such activities to a job code specific to such activities. For purposes of this Article 6 Drug Master File or DMF means a submission to a Regulatory Authority of information concerning the chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) of the Products to permit such Regulatory Authority to review this information in support of any application for Regulatory Approval for a product submitted by a party that has been granted a right to reference such submission without disclosing the contents of such submission to such party. Sutro shall file DMF(s) for the Products with other Regulatory Authorities in the Territory in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement referenced in Section 2.14 (and, for clarity, shall file DMF(s) for the Products with Regulatory Authorities in the European Union (including the United Kingdom) and Japan as necessary to comply with the requirements of such Regulatory Authorities, to the extent not filed under this Supply Agreement).\n\n6.2.1 Compliance. Subject to the foregoing, Sutro shall provide the information set forth under this Section 6.2 in a timely manner and compliant with the reporting requirements of the Regulatory Authorities.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Safety Data. Each Party understands and acknowledges that the other Party and its Affiliates and respective licensees or sublicensees may need to access and utilize and include certain safety data (e.g., adverse event reports) pertaining to product made using Products that is generated or received by such Party and its Affiliates and respective licensees or sublicensees in its Regulatory Materials in its respective Territory as required by applicable Laws. Each Party shall have the right to share any and all such safety data generated by the other Party or the other Party's Affiliates or licensees or sublicensees with its Affiliates and Third Parties (including its licensees and sublicensees) as permitted under section 10.2 of the License Agreement.\n\n6.2.3 Cooperation. Each Party agrees to (i) make its personnel reasonably available at their respective places of employment to consult with the other Party on issues related to the activities conducted in accordance with this Article 6 or otherwise relating to the development of the Products or Vaccine Compositions and thereafter in connection with any request from any Regulatory Authority, including with respect to regulatory, scientific, technical and clinical testing issues, or otherwise, throughout the Term, and (ii) otherwise provide such assistance as may be reasonably requested by the other from time-to-time in connection with the activities to be conducted under this Article 6 or otherwise relating to the development of the Vaccine Compositions or Products.\n\n6.3 Recalls. Each of SutroVax and Sutro will immediately inform the other in writing if it believes one or more lots of any Product(s), or any products made by Sutro or its licensees using the Products (to the extent such products are made using Products from the same batch provided to SutroVax), or any Vaccine Compositions should be subject to recall from distribution, withdrawal or some other field action, or that potential adulteration, misbranding, and/or other issues have arisen that relate to the safety or efficacy of such Product.

Sutro shall provide SutroVax with a copy of the applicable portion of any correspondence made by Sutro to a Regulatory Authority for review and comment prior to submission to the applicable Regulatory Authority solely to the extent such correspondence made by Sutro is related to SutroVax or is in response to a request, directive or correspondence from the applicable Regulatory Authority regarding SutroVax or a Vaccine Composition (e.g., in response to a report regarding a pre- approval inspection for SutroVax). Sutro will consider in good faith any comments received from SutroVax within the time period indicated by Sutro (which shall not be less than [***], to the extent consistent with the require timeline for Sutro's response) with respect to any matter that relates to SutroVax. In addition, Sutro shall notify SutroVax of any occurrences or information that arise out of Sutro's Manufacturing activities that have, or could reasonably be expected to have, adverse regulatory compliance or reporting consequences concerning any Product(s) or which might otherwise be reasonably expected to adversely affect the supply by Sutro of Product(s) to SutroVax.\n\n6.6 Changes or Modifications in Manufacturing Activities. Sutro shall not make any changes to the Specifications, processes, Facilities, raw materials, raw material suppliers or any other item that would affect the Manufacturing activities related to the Product (a Manufacturing Change) that (a) would require a change to the applicable Drug Master File, (b) would be reasonably expected to cause SutroVax to be materially delayed obtaining any Regulatory Approval with respect to Vaccine Compositions or (c) causes the Product to not meet the Specification therefor (including the Activity Test with respect to Extract); without SutroVax's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delated). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sutro shall promptly make and implement such changes as are required by Applicable Law provided that, prior to implementation, Sutro shall provide notice thereof to SutroVax and confer with SutroVax with respect to its timelines, estimated effect on Price and other issues regarding such implementation.

In addition, SutroVax shall have the right to request changes in or modifications to the Specifications and Sutro will consider in good faith any such requested changes or modifications. All such changes or modifications shall be documented in writing and shall be signed by an authorized representative of SutroVax and Sutro. If such changes or modifications result in a material change in Sutro's Manufacturing costs or lead times, the Parties shall agree upon an appropriate adjustment to the Price or in the delivery schedules, as the case may be, for Product(s) to be provided by Sutro hereunder. Sutro shall promptly implement any agreed upon changes to the Specifications.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.7 Quality Agreement.

Either Party may from time to time replace its Principal Contact with a different employee, but unless required due to events beyond its control, neither Party will replace its Principal Contact without at least [***] days prior notice to the other Party. The two Principal Contacts shall communicate with each other regularly during the Term as the Parties may agree or as the Principal Contacts shall mutually determine to be useful.\n\n11.2 Escalation. The Parties intend that, to the maximum extent practicable, they shall reach decisions hereunder cooperatively through discussions among the Principal Contacts and by mutual consent of the Parties. In situations in which that does not occur, disputes or differences arising out of or in connection with this Supply Agreement shall initially be referred for review by the Parties' respective Senior Managements (as defined below). Such Senior Managements shall discuss the proposed dispute or difference, and shall meet with respect thereto if either of them believes a meeting or meetings are likely to be useful. If the Senior Managements do not resolve the dispute or difference within [***] days (or such lesser or longer period as they may agree is a useful period for their discussions), then either Party may pursue its other available remedies, consistent with this Supply Agreement. As used herein, Sutro's Senior Management means its then-current CEO, and SutroVax's Senior Management means its then-current CEO. For clarity, there shall be no obligation for any Disputed Matter arising out of Section 2.14 or 2.15 to be referred to the Senior Management to review prior to such matters being resolved by arbitration pursuant to Sections 11.3 and 11.4.\n\n11.3 Arbitration. If the Senior Managements are not able to resolve such dispute referred to them under Section 11.2 within such [***] day period, then such dispute shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration as follows: The Parties shall select a mutually agreeable arbitrator who has significant relevant experience in the subject matter of the disputed issue and no affiliation or pre-existing relationship with either Party. If the Parties cannot agree on an arbitrator within [***] days after the end of the [***] day period referred in Section 11.2 (or with respect to a Disputed Matter described in Section 11.4, after referral by a Party of such Disputed Matter to arbitration), either Party may request the Judicial and Mediation Services (JAMS) in San Francisco, CA to appoint an arbitrator on behalf of the Parties in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of JAMS, and the proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with JAMS rules. The arbitrator may decide any issue as to whether, or as to the extent to which, any dispute is subject to the arbitration and other dispute resolution provisions in this Supply Agreement. The arbitrator must base the award on the provisions of this Supply Agreement and must render the award in a writing which must include an explanation of the reasons for such award. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator's fees and expenses shall be shared equally by the Parties, unless the arbitrator in the award assesses such fees and expenses against one of the Parties or allocates such fees and expenses other than equally between the Parties. Each Party shall bear and pay its own expenses incurred in connection with any dispute resolution under this Section 11.3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party shall have the right, without waiving any right or remedy available to such Party under this Supply Agreement or otherwise, to seek and obtain from any court of competent jurisdiction any interim or provisional relief that is necessary or desirable to protect the rights or property of such Party, pending the selection of the arbitrator hereunder or pending the arbitrator's decision of the dispute subject to arbitration.\n\n\n\n\n\n11.4 Baseball Arbitration. In the event (a) the Parties do not enter into a Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement as described in Section 2.14 or (b) the Parties do not enter into a Transfer Addendum as described in Section 2.15 (Disputed Matter), then upon either Party's request with respect to the Disputed Matter in clause (a) or SutroVax's request with respect to the Disputed Matter in clause (b), such Disputed Matter shall be resolved by binding arbitration conducted pursuant to Section 11.3, except that the procedures for the conduct of such arbitration shall be as follows:\n\n11.4.1 Each Party shall provide the arbitrator and the other Party with a written report setting forth its position with respect to the substance of such Disputed Matter and a full draft Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement or Transfer Addendum, as applicable, and may submit a revised report, position and draft Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement or Transfer Addendum, as applicable, to the arbitrator within [***] days of receiving the other Party's report and draft Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement or Transfer Addendum, as applicable. If so requested by the arbitrator, each Party shall make oral and/or other written submissions to the arbitrator in accordance with procedures to be established by the arbitrator; provided that other Party shall have the right to be present during any oral submissions. The arbitrator shall select one of the Party's draft Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement or Transfer Addendum, as applicable, as his or her decision, based on what is most reasonable and equitable to each of the Parties under the circumstances and reflective of reasonable and customary terms in the biopharmaceutical industry for agreements of this type and most closely reflects the Parties' intent as expressed in this Supply Agreement and the License Agreement, and shall not have the authority to render any substantive decision other than to so select the draft Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement or Transfer Addendum, as applicable, of Sutro or SutroVax (as initially submitted, or as revised in accordance with the foregoing, as applicable). For clarity, it is understood that the Parties intend the arbitration under this Section 11.4 to be a baseball arbitration type proceeding; and the arbitrator may fashion such detailed procedures as the arbitrator considers appropriate to implement this intent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no event shall the Phase 3/Commercial Supply Agreement or Transfer Addendum contain any provision granting to SutroVax or its Affiliates or Sublicensees any right to obtain or use any Sutro Core Know-How.\n\n11.4.2 In any arbitration under this Section 11.4, the arbitrator and the Parties shall use their best efforts to resolve such Disputed Matter within [***] days after the selection of the arbitrator, or as soon thereafter as is practicable.\n\nARTICLE 12 MISCELLANEOUS\n\n12.1 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, each Party shall bear its own costs, fees and expenses incurred by such Party in connection with this Supply Agreement.\n\n12.2 Licenses and Permits. Each Party shall, at its sole cost and expense, maintain in full force and affect all necessary licenses, permits, and other authorizations required by Applicable Law in order to carry out its duties and obligations hereunder.\n\n\n\n\n\n12.3 Force Majeure. No Party shall be liable for a failure or delay in performing any of its obligations under this Supply Agreement if, but only to the extent that such failure or delay is due to causes beyond the reasonable control of the affected Party, including: (a) acts of God; (b) fire, explosion, or unusually severe weather; (c) war, invasion, riot, terrorism, or other civil unrest; (d) governmental laws, orders, restrictions, actions, embargo or blockages; (e) national or regional emergency; (f) strikes or industrial disputes at a national level which directly impact the affected Party's performance under this Supply Agreement; or (g) other similar cause outside of the reasonable control of such Party (Force Majeure); provided that the Party affected shall promptly notify the other of the Force Majeure condition and shall use reasonable efforts to eliminate, cure or overcome any such causes and resume performance of its obligations as soon as possible. If the performance of any obligation of a Party under this Supply Agreement is delayed owing to such a Force Majeure for any continuous period of more than [***] days, the other Party shall have the right to terminate this Supply Agreement.\n\n12.4 Neither Party may assign or transfer this Supply Agreement, including by merger, operation of law, or otherwise, without the other Party's prior written consent (which shall not be withheld unreasonably) except each Party may assign this Supply Agreement without the other Party's consent in the case of assignment or transfer to a Third Party that succeeds to all or substantially all of the assigning Party's business and assets relating to the subject matter of this Supply Agreement, whether by sale, merger, operation of law or otherwise. Any attempted assignment by a Party in violation of this Section without the written consent of the other Party will be null and void. Except as above limited, this Supply Agreement is binding upon and will inure to the benefit of each of the Parties, its successors and assigns. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that a Party is acquired, the acquiring Party shall agree in writing to abide by the terms of this Supply Agreement. Sutro agrees that if it assigns the License Agreement to any successor as allowed under section 15.1 of the License Agreement, it will also assign to such successor this Supply Agreement in accordance with this Section 12.4.\n\n12.5 This Supply Agreement incorporates the Exhibits referenced herein. This Supply Agreement, together with the License Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties hereto with respect to its subject matter. To the extent of any conflict between this Agreement and the License Agreement, the License Agreement shall govern and control.\n\n12.6 All notices, requests or other communication provided for or permitted hereunder shall be given in writing and shall be hand delivered or sent by confirmed facsimile, reputable courier or by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to the address set forth below, or to such other address of which either Party may inform the other in writing. Notices will be deemed delivered on the earliest of transmission by facsimile, actual receipt or [***] days after mailing as described herein.\n\nIf to Sutro: Sutro Biopharma, Inc. 310 Utah Ave., Suite 150 South San Francisco, CA 94080 Attention: Chief Executive Officer\n\n\n\n\n\nIf to SutroVax: SutroVax, Inc. 353 Hatch Dr. Foster City, CA 94404 Attention: Chief Executive Officer\n\n12.7 This Supply Agreement may be amended, modified or waived only in a writing signed by the Party or Parties to be bound thereby.\n\n12.8 If any provision of this Supply Agreement shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law and the Parties' fundamental intentions hereunder, and the remaining provisions shall not be affected or impaired.\n\n12.9 Nothing herein contained shall constitute this a joint venture agreement and nothing herein shall constitute any Party as a partner, principal or agent of any other, this being an agreement between independent contracting entities. Except as expressly set forth herein, no Party shall have the authority to bind any other in any respect whatsoever to Third Parties. Except as provided herein, nothing contained in this Supply Agreement shall be construed as conferring any right on any Party to use any name, trade name, trademark or other designation of any other Party hereto, unless the express, written permission of such other Party has been obtained.\n\n12.10 This Supply Agreement has been submitted to the scrutiny of, and has been negotiated by, both Parties and their counsel, and shall be given a fair and reasonable interpretation in accordance with its terms, without consideration or weight being given to any such term's having been drafted by any Party or its counsel.\n\n12.11 This Supply Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of California, without regard to any conflict of laws rules to the contrary.\n\n12.12 Each Party acknowledges that the other Party may likely suffer irreparable harm from such Party's breach or threatened breach of this Agreement and the other Party, in such cases, would therefore be entitled, without waiving any other right or remedy available to, to injunctive relief (including specific performance) without the requirement to post a bond, provided the waiver by such Party of the other Party's requirement to post a bond shall expire on the Change of Control of the other Party, and each party agrees that the arbitrator selected under Section 11.3 shall have the power to grant such injunctive relief (or order specific performance). The Parties shall comply with any such injunctive relief (including specific performance) ordered by the arbitrator and agree that such order may, to the extent not precluded by applicable law, be enforceable as a final award in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n12.13 This Supply Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

In such case, the Parties shall use commercially reasonable and legal efforts to mitigate the amount of such taxes that would need to be withheld and/or paid. Any amounts withheld pursuant to this Section 6.5 will be timely paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, and will be treated for purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Party that otherwise would have received such amounts.

In the case of any individual consultant of SFJ or its Affiliates (excluding SFJ's and its Affiliates' Permitted Third Parties), if SFJ is unable to cause such consultant to agree to such assignment obligation despite SFJ's using commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate such assignment obligation, then SFJ shall either: (A) cause such consultant to grant an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully-paid, freely-assignable license, with the right to sublicense through multiple tiers, under their rights in such Trial Invention to develop, make, have made, use, sell, have sold, offer for sale and import the Product for any and all uses, except where Applicable Law requires otherwise and except in the case of consultants who are employed by governmental, not- for-profit, or public institutions that have standard policies against such an assignment (in which case, SFJ shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a suitable license, or right to obtain such a license); or (B) refrain from using such consultant to conduct activities pursuant to this Agreement unless PB obtains MedImmune's written consent thereto.\n\n(c) SFJ shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from each Third Party contractor that SFJ or its Affiliate proposes to engage to conduct activities under or in connection with this Agreement on behalf of SFJ or its Affiliates (i) an assignment, (ii) an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully-paid, freely-assignable license, with the right to sublicense through multiple tiers, or (iii) a non\u2011exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully-paid, freely-assignable license, with the right to sublicense through multiple tiers ((i) through (iii) in order of preference), to PB of any Trial Invention that such Third Party contractor conceives, discovers, develops or otherwise makes in connection with activities conducted relating to this Agreement.

Upon the earliest of (A) receipt of Regulatory Approval of the Product for the Indication in at least one of the US, the EU, any Designated European Country, Japan or China or (B) termination of this Agreement in accordance with any termination clause or section of this Agreement, in each case, PB and SFJ will promptly enter into the Trial Data Package Purchase Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit K, and PB will purchase, and SFJ will sell to PB, sole and exclusive ownership of all Research Results, including the Trial Data Package.\n\n11.1.1.5 Inventorship; Further Assurances. Inventorship of Trial Inventions will be determined according to the principles of US patent law. SFJ agrees to cooperate fully, to cause its Affiliates to cooperate fully, and to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause its and their respective Permitted Third Parties to cooperate fully, in each case: (a) with PB in the preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance of Patents Covering Trial Inventions; and (b) with MedImmune in the preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance of Patents (x) Covering AstraZeneca Product Improvements described in clause (i) of Section 11.1.1.2(a) or AstraZeneca Product Know-How described in clause (ii) of Section 11.1.1.2(a) or (y) filed by or on behalf of PB claiming any Licensed Know-How. Such cooperation includes executing all papers and instruments, or requiring its employees, consultants and Permitted Third Parties, to execute such papers and instruments, so as to (i) effectuate (A) the ownership of AstraZeneca Product Improvements, AstraZeneca Product Know-How and AstraZeneca Product Patents set forth in Section 11.1.1.2, (B) the ownership of Patents that become Licensed Patents pursuant to the last two sentences of Section 5.1.2 of the AZ License as set forth in Section 11.1.1.1(b), and (C) the ownership of Trial Inventions set forth in Section 11.1.1.3(a), including Patents claiming or disclosing Trial Inventions, and (ii) enable (A) MedImmune to apply for and to prosecute patent applications claiming AstraZeneca Product Improvements and Patents that become Licensed Patents pursuant to the last two sentences of Section 5.1.2 of the AZ License in any country and (B) PB to apply for and to prosecute patent applications claiming Trial Inventions in any country.\n\n11.1.1.6 No Other Rights.

As between SFJ and PB, PB will have sole and exclusive right to prepare, file, prosecute and maintain all Patents within the PB Intellectual Property, including all Patents that cover the Trial Inventions, at its own expense (provided that PB shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to prosecute and maintain such Patents). At PB's request and expense (for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses), SFJ will reasonably cooperate with PB in preparing, filing, prosecuting, and maintaining such Patents.\n\n11.3 Intellectual Property Enforcement.\n\n11.3.1 PB Intellectual Property. PB will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to enforce Intellectual Property Controlled by PB, including Intellectual Property that covers the Trial Inventions, against Third Party Infringements.\n\n11.3.2 Infringement of Third Party Rights. If either Party learns of Third Party allegations that it or the other Party or any of its or the other Party's Affiliates or Permitted Third Parties, have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated, or are infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating, any Intellectual Property of a Third Party in connection with either the Clinical Trials or performing its obligations or duties hereunder, such Party will promptly notify the other Party. PB will have sole control and responsibility of, and discretion with respect to, such allegations and any related actions and/or litigation.\n\n11.4 Personally Identifiable Information.\n\n11.4.1 In conducting the Clinical Trials and its other obligations under this Agreement and, if applicable, the Program Transfer Agreement, each Party will comply, and will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to require each applicable Permitted Third Party of such Party to comply, with Applicable Laws relating to privacy or data protection applicable to such Party or the Clinical Trials being conducted by or on behalf of such Party, including ensuring that all necessary (a) consents from Clinical Investigators, Subjects and any others from whom Personally Identifiable Information will be received are obtained; (b) regulatory notifications are filed in all countries for which Sites have been selected; and (c) approvals are obtained in all countries for which Sites have been selected, prior to collection or transfer of such Personally Identifiable Information.

SFJ will indemnify and hold PB; its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents (the PB Indemnified Parties), harmless from any and all Losses, net of any related tax benefit actually realized in the same year as the payment or incurrence of such Losses or any prior year, arising or resulting from any Claims by a Third Party against any PB Indemnified Parties to the extent arising from (a) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of SFJ or any of its Affiliates or any of its or their respective Permitted Third Parties in performing SFJ's obligations under this Agreement or, if applicable, the Program Transfer Agreement; (b) SFJ's material breach of this Agreement or, if applicable, the Program Transfer Agreement; (c) any material breach of a Protocol by SFJ, or its Affiliate, or any of its or their respective Permitted Third Parties; (d) any breach by SFJ of any provision of the AZ License by which SFJ has agreed to be bound in this Agreement; (e) a physical injury or death of a subject that is caused by the subject's participation in any clinical trial conducted by or on behalf of SFJ or any of its Affiliates after a Program Transfer whether or not directly attributable to the Product(other than the Product manufactured by PB); and/or (f) from any after any Program Transfer, product liability claims resulting from the Commercialization of Product other than Product manufactured by PB by or on behalf of SFJ or any of its Affiliates, licensees or sublicensees; except to the extent that any of the foregoing (a) through (f) was caused by (i) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any PB Indemnified Party, or (ii) material breach of this Agreement, or, if applicable, the Program Transfer Agreement, by PB.\n\n12.1.2 By PB. PB will indemnify and hold SFJ, its Affiliates, SFJ's investors and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents (the SFJ Indemnified Parties), harmless from any and all Losses, net of any related tax benefit actually realized in the same year as the payment or incurrence of such Losses or any prior year, arising or resulting from any Claims by a Third Party against any SFJ Indemnified Parties to the extent arising from (a) a Product supplied by PB; (b) a physical injury or death of a Subject that is caused by the Subject's participation in the Clinical Trials whether or not directly attributable to the Product (excluding any Clinical Trial conducted by or on behalf of SFJ or its Affiliate after a Program Transfer); (c) PB's gross negligence or willful misconduct in performing its obligations under this Agreement or, if applicable, the Program Transfer Agreement; (d) PB's material breach of this Agreement or, if applicable, the Program Transfer Agreement, (e) any material breach of a Protocol by PB, or its Affiliate, or of its or their respective Permitted Third Parties, (f) actual or alleged infringement of any Third Party's Intellectual Property by the Product or by either Party in performing its duties or obligations hereunder with respect to the Product; and (g) injuries sustained by Subjects in connection with the Clinical Trials, including Claims arising prior to the Effective Date based upon physical injury or death of a Subject in connection with the Clinical Trials, or from the Commercialization of the Product; except to the extent that any of the foregoing (a) through (g) were caused by (i) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any\n\nSource: PHASEBIO PHARMACEUTICALS INC, 10-K, 3/30/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nSFJ Indemnified Party, or (ii) material breach of this Agreement, or, if applicable, the Program Transfer Agreement by, SFJ.\n\n12.2 Indemnification Procedure.\n\n12.2.1 Notice of Claim. A Party believing that it is entitled to indemnification under Section 12.1.1 or 12.1.2 (an Indemnified Party) will give prompt written notice (each, an Indemnification Claim Notice) to the other Party (the Indemnifying Party) upon receipt of notice of the commencement of any Claim for which indemnification may be sought, or if earlier, upon the assertion of any such Claim by a Third Party (it being understood and agreed, however, that the failure by an Indemnified Party to give notice of a Claim of a Third Party as provided in this Section 12.2.1 will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligation under this Agreement except and only to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced as a result of such failure to give notice). Each Indemnification Claim Notice will contain a description of the Claim and the nature and amount of the Loss (to the extent that the nature and amount of such Loss are known at such time). The Indemnified Party will furnish promptly to the Indemnifying Party copies of all papers and official documents received in respect of any Losses.\n\n12.2.2 Control of Defense. At its option, the Indemnifying Party may assume the defense of any Claim by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party within [***] after the Indemnifying Party's receipt of an Indemnification Claim Notice. The assumption of the defense of a Claim by the Indemnifying Party will not be construed as an acknowledgment that the Indemnifying Party is liable to indemnify the Indemnified Party in respect of the Claim, nor will it constitute a waiver by the Indemnifying Party of any defenses it may assert against the Indemnified Party's claim for indemnification. Upon assuming the defense of a Claim, the Indemnifying Party may appoint as lead counsel in the defense of the Claim any legal counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party that is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. In the event the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Claim, the Indemnified Party will promptly deliver to the Indemnifying Party all original notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party in connection with the Claim. Should the Indemnifying Party assume the defense of a Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the analysis, defense or settlement of such Claim.\n\n12.2.3 Right to Participate in Defense. Without limiting Section 12.2.2, the Indemnified Party will be entitled to (a) participate in, but not control, the defense of such Claim and to engage counsel of its choice for such purpose; provided, however, that such engagement will be at the Indemnified Party's own expense unless the engagement thereof has been specifically authorized by the Indemnifying Party in writing, and (b) control its defense of such Claim and to engage counsel of its choice for such purpose, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, if the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense and engage counsel in accordance with Section 12.2.2.\n\n12.2.4 Settlement. With respect to any Losses related solely to payment of money damages in connection with a Claim and that includes a complete and unconditional\n\nSource: PHASEBIO PHARMACEUTICALS INC, 10-K, 3/30/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nrelease of the Indemnified Party, will not result in the Indemnified Party admitting liability, becoming subject to injunctive or other equitable relief that will otherwise adversely affect the business of the Indemnified Party in any manner, and as to which the Indemnifying Party will have acknowledged in writing the obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder, the Indemnifying Party will have the sole right to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss, on such terms as the Indemnifying Party, in its sole discretion, will deem appropriate. With respect to all other Losses in connection with Claims, where the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the Claim in accordance with Section 12.2.2, the Indemnifying Party will have authority to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss provided it obtains the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnifying Party will not be liable for any settlement or other disposition of a Loss by the Indemnified Party that is reached without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Regardless of whether the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Claim, the Indemnified Party will not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.\n\n12.2.5 Cooperation. Regardless of whether the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Claim, the Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof and will furnish such records, information and testimony, provide such witnesses and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith. Such cooperation will include access during normal business hours afforded to the Indemnifying Party to, and reasonable retention by the Indemnified Party of, records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Claim, and making employees and agents available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder, and the Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party for all its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection therewith.\n\n12.3 Insurance.\n\n12.3.1 Generally. Commencing as of the Effective Date and thereafter during the Development Term, and subject to Section 12.3.2 below, each Party will carry and maintain, at its own expense, insurance coverage of the kind and with liability limits that, at a minimum, satisfy the requirements of Section 12.3.2, to protect itself and the other Party against any claims or liabilities that may arise from the conduct of the Clinical Trials and all other rights and obligations hereunder with insurers with a minimum A- A.M. Best rating. Any deductibles for such insurance policies will be assumed by the insuring Party. Such insurance policies will be primary and non-contributing with respect to any other similar insurance policies available to other Party and their Affiliates. Prior to the Effective Date, and annually, at each anniversary of the Effective Date (unless, during such year, expiration of the applicable policy occurs first, in which case, on such expiration date), at a Party's written request the other Party will supply documentation of such insurance coverage via original certificates of insurance, if applicable.\n\nSource: PHASEBIO PHARMACEUTICALS INC, 10-K, 3/30/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nEach Party will provide the other Party a minimum of [***] prior written notice if it is unable to obtain appropriate insurance coverage or if its coverage is canceled, unable to be renewed or materially changed. For clarity, any insurance coverage or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage does not limit or reduce a Party's liability under this Agreement. Each Party will ensure that no subcontractor, including any Permitted Third Party, will continue to perform the work unless such subcontractor is insured as deemed appropriate by the Party engaging the Permitted Third Party.\n\n12.3.2 Minimum Requirements. Commencing as of the start of the Clinical Trials and thereafter, during the Term (or longer if otherwise stated below), at a minimum, each Party will maintain the following types of insurance coverage at a minimum level that is the greater of (a) the highest minimum level required by Applicable Law in the countries in which the Clinical Trials and other obligations hereunder are being performed or (b) the following (to the extent different).\n\n12.3.2.1 Commercial General Liability: [***] dollars ($[***]) per occurrence; [***] dollars ($[***]) Product and Completed Operations aggregate, including Premises & Operations, Personal Injury, Product and Completed Operations; [***] dollars ($[***]) combined single limit on all owned, non-owned and hired vehicles of such Party.\n\n12.3.2.2 Umbrella Excess Liability: [***] dollars ($[***]) per occurrence.\n\n12.3.2.3 Clinical Trials Liability: [***] dollars ($[***]) per occurrence. PB will obtain such Clinical Trials Liability insurance on a global basis, and, if required, supplemented Clinical Trials Liability Insurance in the US, at its expense and SFJ will obtain supplemental Clinical Trials Liability insurance for the SFJ Territory and on a country specific basis in the European Clinical Trial Countries as required by Applicable Law at its expense, which will be considered Development Costs. Coverage must be maintained for as long as required by Applicable Law in each country after release of the last Subject from the Clinical Trials or where there is no legal requirement at least [***] after the termination of this Agreement.\n\n12.3.2.4 Professional Liability: Any subcontractor, including any Permitted Third Party, who provides professional services to such Party for the Clinical Trials, will obtain Professional Liability Insurance in lieu of Clinical Trial Insurance, with a minimum limit of [***] dollars ($[***]) per occurrence. Coverage must be maintained for at least [***] after the later of (i) expiration or early termination of this Agreement and (ii) release of the last Subject from the Clinical Trials.\n\n12.3.3 Additional Insured. Each Party will include the other Party and its Affiliates as additional insured parties on such Party's Clinical Trial Liability insurance, as set forth in Section 12.3.2.3 for [***] after the later of termination of this Agreement or release of the last Subject from the Clinical Trials.\n\n12.3.4 Product Liability Insurance. Prior to a Program Transfer, PB will be responsible for maintaining product liability insurance related to the Development and\n\nSource: PHASEBIO PHARMACEUTICALS INC, 10-K, 3/30/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nCommercialization of the Product at its expense with SFJ to be named as an additional insured party.

The cost of the arbitration, including the fees of the arbitrators and reasonable attorney's fees of the prevailing Party, shall be borne by the Party the arbitrator determines has not prevailed in the arbitration.\n\n15.10.2.5 If an arbitral award does not impose an injunction on the losing Party or contain a money damages award in excess of [***] dollars USD ($[***]), then the arbitral award shall be final and binding and shall only be subject to such challenges as would otherwise be permissible under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 et. seq. . Judgment on such an award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction and the Parties undertake to carry out the award without delay. In the event that an arbitral award imposes an injunction or contains a monetary award in excess of [***] dollars USD ($[***]), the Parties agree that such award may be appealed pursuant to the AAA's Optional Appellate Arbitration Rules (Appellate Rules) and should not be considered to be final and binding until after the time for filing the notice of appeal under the Appellate Rules has expired.

DEFINITIONS\n\n         1.1      Throughout this Agreement, and unless the context otherwise                   requires, the terms shown on Exhibit A (whether or not                   capitalized) shall have the meanings there specified.

OFFICE SPACE\n\n         2.1      During the term of this Agreement, LKPL will provide                   Axiometric with a license to use office space in LKPL's                   corporate facility in Columbia, Maryland, free of charge.\n\n         2.2      LKPL will allow Axiometric to use enough office space for two                   individuals and associated equipment in locations convenient                   for LKPL's purposes for as long as that space is available and                   not needed by LKPL for its own purposes.

The Water Meter is a hardware device                            with integral software. The software includes, under                            license, the Axiometric wireless mesh networking                            intellectual property. The Water Meter is capable of                            interfacing with a variety of water meter registers,                            recording water usage, logging various exceptional                            conditions, and reporting them via a radio link. The                            Water Meter is also capable of forming a mesh network                            with other Water Meters to extend the radio reporting                            range using the aforementioned Axiometric mesh                            networking intellectual property.

SECTION 1. SERVICES AS UNDERWRITER Section 1.1 Integrity will act as principal underwriter for the distribution of the Shares covered by the registration statement, prospectus, and statement of additional information then in effect of the Fund (the Registration Statement) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 1933 Act), and the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act). Section 1.2 Integrity agrees to use its best efforts to solicit orders for the sale of the Shares at the public offering price, as determined in accordance with the Registration Statement, and will undertake such advertising and promotion as it believes is reasonable in connection with such solicitation. Integrity shall order Shares from the Fund only to the extent that it shall have received purchase orders therefore. Section 1.3 All activities by Integrity as underwriter of the Shares shall comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including, without limitation, all rules and regulations made or adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) or by any securities association registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Fund's Registration Statement.

Section 1.5 Integrity acknowledges that, whenever in the judgment of the Fund's officers such action is warranted for any reason, including, without limitation, market, economic, or political conditions, those officers may decline to accept any orders for, or make any sales of, the Shares until such time as those officers deem it advisable to accept such orders and to make such sales. Section 1.6 Integrity shall be deemed to be an independent contractor and, except as specifically provided or authorized herein, shall have no authority to act for or represent the Fund. Integrity will act only on its own behalf as principal should it choose to enter into selling agreements with selected dealers or others. Integrity may allow commissions or concessions to dealers in such amounts as Integrity shall determine from time to time, as set forth in the Fund's Registration Statement. Except as may otherwise be determined by Integrity and the Fund from time to time, such commissions or concessions shall be uniform to all dealers. Shares sold to dealers shall be for resale by such dealers only at the public offering price(s) set forth in the Fund's then current Registration Statement. The price the Fund shall receive for all Shares purchased from the Fund shall be the net asset value used in determining the public offering price applicable to the sale of such Shares.\n\nSource: INTEGRITY FUNDS, 485BPOS, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 1.7 In consideration of the services rendered pursuant to this Agreement, Integrity shall receive the excess, if any, of the sales price, as set forth in the Fund's Registration Statement, over the net asset value of Shares sold by Integrity, as underwriter. The Fund shall also pay Integrity any distribution and/or service fees applicable to the Shares as authorized by the Shareholder Services Plan (the Plan) adopted by the Fund under Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and set forth in the Fund's Registration Statement. Such fees shall be payable in the manner and terms set forth in the Plan. Section 1.8 Integrity will bear all expenses in connection with the performance of its services and the incurring of distribution expenses under this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, distribution expenses of Integrity shall mean all expenses borne by Integrity or by any other person with which Integrity has an agreement approved by the Fund, which expenses represent payment for activities primarily intended to result in the sale of Shares, including, but not limited to, the following: (a) payments made to, and expenses of, persons who provide support services in connection with the distribution of Shares, including, but not limited to, office space and equipment, telephone facilities, answering routine inquiries regarding the Fund, processing shareholder transactions, and providing any other shareholder services; (b) costs relating to the formulation and implementation of marketing and promotional activities, including, but not limited to, direct mail promotions and television, radio, newspaper, magazine, and other mass media advertising; (c) costs of printing and distributing prospectuses and reports of the Fund to prospective shareholders of the Fund; (d) costs involved in preparing, printing, and distributing sales literature pertaining to the Fund; (e) costs involved in obtaining whatever information, analyses, and reports with respect to marketing and promotional activities that the Fund may, from time to time, deem advisable; and 2\n\nSource: INTEGRITY FUNDS, 485BPOS, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(f) sales commissions and other fees paid, together with related financing costs to brokers, dealers or other selling entities with a dealer agreement in effect for the sale of Fund Shares.

DUTIES OF THE FUND Section 2.1 The Fund agrees at its own expense to execute any and all documents, to furnish any and all information, and to take any other actions that may be reasonably necessary in connection with the qualification of the Shares for sale in those states that Integrity may designate.

The Fund shall also furnish Integrity upon request with: (a) annual audits of the Fund's books and accounts made by independent public accountants regularly retained by the Fund, (b) semi-annual unaudited financial statements pertaining to the Fund, (c) quarterly earnings statements prepared by the Fund, (d) a monthly itemized list of the securities in the portfolio of the Fund, (e) monthly balance sheets as soon as practicable after the end of each month, and (f) from time to time such additional information regarding the Fund's financial condition as Integrity may reasonably request. Section 2.3 The Fund shall pay to Integrity, as set forth in the Registration Statement, any distribution and service fee authorized by the Plan. SECTION 3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES Section 3.1 The Fund represents to Integrity that all registration statements, prospectuses, and statements of additional information filed by the Fund with the SEC under the 1933 Act and the 1940 Act with respect to the Shares of the Fund have been carefully prepared in conformity with the requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder. As used in this Agreement, the terms registration statement, prospectus, and statement of additional information shall mean any registration statement, prospectus, and statement of additional information filed by the Fund with the SEC and any amendments and supplements thereto which at any time shall have been filed with the SEC. The Fund represents and warrants to Integrity that any registration statement, prospectus, and statement of additional information, when such registration statement becomes effective, will include all statements required to be contained therein in conformity with the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC; that all statements of fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus, or statement of additional information will be true and correct when such registration statement becomes effective; and that neither any registration statement nor any prospectus or statement of additional information when such registration statement becomes effective will include an untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading to a purchaser of Shares. Integrity may, but shall not be obligated to, propose from time to time such amendment or amendments to any registration statement and such supplement or supplements to any prospectus or statement of additional information as, in the light of future developments, may, in the opinion of Integrity's counsel, be necessary or advisable. If the Fund shall not propose such amendment or amendments and/or supplement or supplements within fifteen days after receipt by the Fund of a written request from Integrity to do so, Integrity may, at its option, terminate this Agreement. The Fund shall not file any amendment to any registration statement or supplement to any prospectus or statement of additional information without giving Integrity reasonable notice thereof in advance; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Agreement shall in any way limit the Fund's right to file at any time such amendments to any registration statement and/or supplements to any prospectus or statement of additional information, of whatever character, as the Fund may deem advisable, such right being in all respects absolute and unconditional. 3\n\nSource: INTEGRITY FUNDS, 485BPOS, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nSECTION 4. INDEMNIFICATION Section 4.1 The Fund authorizes Integrity and any dealers with whom Integrity has entered into dealer agreements to use any prospectus or statement of additional information furnished by the Fund from time to time in connection with the sale of Shares. The Fund agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Integrity, its several officers and governors, and any person who controls Integrity within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, free and harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, and expenses (including the cost of investigating or defending such claims, demands, or liabilities and any counsel fees incurred in connection therewith) which Integrity, its officers and governors, or any such controlling person may incur under the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, or common law or otherwise, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement, any prospectus, or any statement of additional information, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated in any registration statement, any prospectus, or any statement of additional information, or necessary to make the statements in any of them not misleading; provided, however, that the Fund's agreement to indemnify Integrity, its officers or governors, and any such controlling person shall not be deemed to cover any claims, demands, liabilities, or expenses arising out of or based upon any statements or representations made by Integrity or its representatives or agents other than such statements and representations as are contained in any registration statement, prospectus, or statement of additional information and in such financial and other statements as are furnished to Integrity pursuant to paragraph 2.2 hereof; and further provided that the Fund's agreement to indemnify Integrity and the Fund's representations and warranties hereinbefore set forth in paragraph 3 shall not be deemed to cover any liability to the Fund or its shareholders to which Integrity would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence in the performance of its duties, or by reason of Integrity's reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement. The Fund's agreement to indemnify Integrity, its officers and governors, and any such controlling person, as aforesaid, is expressly conditioned upon the Fund's being notified of any action brought against Integrity, its officers or governors, or any such controlling person, such notification to be given by letter or by telegram addressed to the Fund at its principal office in Minot, North Dakota, and sent to the Fund by the person against whom such action is brought, within ten days after the summons or other first legal process shall have been served. The failure so to notify the Fund of any such action shall not relieve the Fund from any liability that the Fund may have to the person against whom such action is brought by reason of any such untrue statement or omission or alleged omission otherwise than on account of the Fund's indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph 4.1. The Fund's indemnification agreement contained in this paragraph 4.1 and the Fund's representations and warranties in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of Integrity, its officers and governors, or any controlling person, and shall survive the delivery of any Shares. This agreement of indemnity will inure exclusively to Integrity's benefit, to the benefit of its several officers and governors, and their respective estates, and to the benefit of the controlling persons and their successors. The Fund agrees to notify Integrity promptly of the commencement of any litigation or proceedings against the Fund or any of its officers or trustees in connection with the issuance and sale of any Shares. 4\n\nSource: INTEGRITY FUNDS, 485BPOS, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 4.2 Integrity agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold the Fund, its several officers and trustees, and any person who controls the Fund within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, free and harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, and expenses (including the costs of investigating or defending such claims, demands, or liabilities and any counsel fees incurred in connection therewith) that the Fund, its officers or trustees, or any such controlling person may incur under the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, or common law or otherwise, but only to the extent that such liability or expense incurred by the Fund, its officers or trustees, or such controlling person resulting from such claims or demands shall arise out of or be based upon (a) any unauthorized sales literature, advertisements, information, statements, or representations or (b) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in information furnished in writing by Integrity to the Fund and used in the answers to any of the items of the registration statement or in the corresponding statements made in the prospectus or statement of additional information, or shall arise out of or be based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in connection with such information furnished in writing by Integrity to the Fund and required to be stated in such answers or necessary to make such information not misleading. Integrity's agreement to indemnify the Fund, its officers and trustees, and any such controlling person, as aforesaid, is expressly conditioned upon Integrity's being notified of any action brought against the Fund, its officers or trustees, or any such controlling person, such notification to be given by letter or telegram addressed to Integrity at its principal office in Minot, North Dakota, and sent to Integrity by the person against whom such action is brought, within ten days after the summons or other first legal process shall have been served. The failure so to notify Integrity of any such action shall not relieve Integrity from any liability that Integrity may have to the Fund, its officers or trustees, or to such controlling person by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission otherwise than on account of Integrity's indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph 4.2. Integrity agrees to notify the Fund promptly of the commencement of any litigation or proceedings against Integrity or any of its officers or governors in connection with the issuance and sale of any Shares. 5\n\nSource: INTEGRITY FUNDS, 485BPOS, 1/21/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 4.3 In case any action shall be brought against any indemnified party under paragraph 4.1 or 4.2, and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall wish to do so, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party. If the indemnifying party opts to assume the defense of such action, the indemnifying party will not be liable to the indemnified party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than (a) reasonable costs of investigation or the furnishing of documents or witnesses and (b) all reasonable fees and expenses of separate counsel to such indemnified party if (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the indemnified party shall have concluded reasonably that representation of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them in the conduct of the defense of such action. SECTION 5. EFFECTIVENESS OF REGISTRATION Section 5.1 None of the Shares shall be offered by either Integrity or the Fund under any of the provisions of this Agreement and no orders for the purchase or sale of the Shares hereunder shall be accepted by the Fund if and so long as the effectiveness of the registration statement then in effect or any necessary amendments thereto shall be suspended under any of the provisions of the 1933 Act or if and so long as a current prospectus as required by Section 5(b)(2) of the 1933 Act is not on file with the SEC; provided, however, that nothing contained in this paragraph 5 shall in any way restrict or have an application to or bearing upon the Fund's obligation to repurchase Shares from any shareholder in accordance with the provisions of the Fund's prospectus, statement of additional information, or declaration of trust.
