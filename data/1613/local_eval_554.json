", "input": "New breast events \u2014 locoregional or primary \u2014 occurred in 5.5%, in a median time of 2.8 years; 12.5% developed distant recurrence, in a median time of 2.5 years. Receipt of breast imaging declined over the follow-up period, from 66% in the first year to 58% in the fourth year. Guidelines from the American Cancer Society and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommend mammography 6 to 12 months after completion of radiation therapy for breast cancer and annual mammography thereafter, with the goal of early detection of in-breast recurrences or new primary breast tumors. After your treatment there will usually be one person who is your main contact for your follow-up care. This might be your specialist nurse, hospital doctor, GP, radiographer, or another health professional.

You will have follow-up appointments for some time after your treatment. Exactly how long will depend on your cancer, any side effects of treatment, and the services in your area. You will usually have appointments for several years. After your follow-up appointments finish, you may continue to have PSA tests. The aim of your follow-up appointments is to: 1  check how your cancer has responded to treatment. 2  help you deal with any side effects of treatment. 3  give you a chance to raise any concerns or ask any questions.

Compared with patients under 50 years of age, follow-up imaging was more likely for older women up to age 80 years (odds ratios [ORs] by decade ranging from 1.2 to 1.6) but less likely for those aged 80 years and older (OR, 0.89). Overall, the relationship with age was significant (P < .0001). Yet, the new data analysis revealed that only two thirds of women diagnosed with stage II or III disease receive breast imaging in the first follow-up year after surgery, and nearly two thirds are not receiving annual imaging for the subsequent 4 years.", "output": "duration of follow up care after cancer", "category": "Question Generation 1497.json"}]
