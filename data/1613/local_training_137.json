And then one day he actually heard the voice of Om.

I wish he'd waited and used it as inspiration, as The Sweetest Punch is neither sweet nor punchy. Instead it is passionless, routine and flat.

The costumes are intentionally absurd (think Beach Blanket Babylon), the acting is way over-the-top-camp, and the incidental music could not be worse. The music, BTW, is a combination of pop Renaissance and pop modern; anything but 18th century. The director appears to have had the goal of showing that his company was just too hip and too modern to do anything but make fun of this silly, fusty old play.I like \"The School for Scandal\" very much, and not having found any other DVDs of it, I started out with the intention of keeping a recording of even a bad production. But when they got into the extended bop-be-bop of the drinking song scene, I knew I just couldn't ever sit through this one again.The visuals are also blurry, but with the production being so bad, so what?

Truth be told, this project does not have much to do with the Latin Jazz Eddie is known for. Harlem River Drive is an out and out soul funk album: wha whas, grooving percussion, all the ingredients you would expect from a crack unit during the era.And more: with a baritone sax--an extremely underused instrument in all genres--in front, this album has a uniquely jazzy flavor, even though the beats could be off a Santana or War or Mandrel album.As funk, it works full bore, but the novel textures here make an already fantastic funk project so much more.", "output": "Positive", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1120.json"}, {"instruction": "Given reviews from Amazon, classify those review based on their content into two classes: Negative or Positive.", "input": "This book came out a long time ago.
