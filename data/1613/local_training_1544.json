For example, modern com has been produced to such a large size that it is no longer able to reproduce without man's assistance. Modern dairy cows produce too much milk and if they are not often emptied of milk, they could leak, burst, become infected, and possibly die. Besides, most dogs raised by people can not survive in the wild even with special training. Since natural evolution is extremely slow and mankind's selective production programs only take a few generations to produce a completely new species, natural evolution has already _ mankind's production programs. In addition, mankind has successfully killed off several species all together. For example, there are no more European wolves in existence and mammoths   probably died out because of mankind. Even certain diseases have been permanently got rid of from the planet, and dozens of other diseases will soon be too. Again, natural evolution did i>>t cause most of the destruction during man's rule of the world. Currently, scientists are creating new species with desired characteristics in the lab significantly faster than natural evolution creates new species. In a single generation, new species can be created and destroyed by mankind, while natural evolution could take thousands of years to do the same but only accidentally. Scientists are even able to replace defective   or damaged genes with different genes to attempt to cure genetic defects. This is something that natural evolution could possibly never correct. Eventually scientists will even be able to improve the quality of people. For example, imagine not only correcting your eyesight with gene treatment, but also ensuring that all of your children do not receive your old genes of poor eyesight too. Scientists will one day be able to improve the memory and intelligence of your children, so that they will do better in school and achieve more in life. Doctors and scientists will be able to customize   babies before they are born just like picking options at a car store. \n Question: What can we infer from the passage? \n Options: (A) Near-sighted parents will be able to produce babies with good eyesight in the future. (B) Doctors and scientists will be responsible for mass production of babies in the future. (C) It is natural evolution that is to blame for the destruction of European wolves and mammoths.

Researchers studied a group of people who were born deaf and never learned any spoken language or a formal sign language, but they have developed a gesture system to communicate with people around them. The gestures let them express approximate amounts, but not exact numbers. \"Up to three, they're fine,\" says Elizabet Spaepen, a researcher at the University of Chicago and an author of the study. \"But past three, they start to fall apart.\" In one test, Spaepen would knock her fist against a study participant's fist a certain number of times and then ask them to respond with the same number of knocks. \"If I were to knock four times on their fist, they might knock on my fist five times,\" she says. The finding offers a clue to just how much language affects our understanding of numbers. That has been a big question since 2004, when other researchers published data on two tribes in the Amazon whose members also lack words for big numbers. \"What they have are words that mean one and two,\" Spaepen says, \"and then they have a word to mean many.\" Members of the Amazonian tribes also had trouble matching numbers larger than three or four. But some scholars felt that these earlier studies failed to prove that language was the reason. They pointed out that the tribes lived in groups that didn't use money and had no need for exact numbers. The new research appears to answer that criticism. \"It proves that the kinds of problems in understanding numbers that we found in the Amazonian tribes are not due to just the cultural or environmental circumstances,\" says Peter Gordon of Columbia University, one of the researchers involved in the earlier studies. \n Question: The participants of the new study   _  . \n Options: (A) cannot communicate with one another (B) use a formal sign language to express numbers (C) have some physical disability (D) come from a distant tribe", "output": "C", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

If you hide several objects from babies, they will only remember one of those objects. But a new study, which was published in an issue of Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science, finds that when babies \"forget\" about an object, not all is lost. Researchers used to think that babies less than two years old did not understand that an object continues to exist when it is not in the baby's view. But in mid-1980s, new ways of doing experiments with babies found that they do, in fact, know that objects don't disappear when they do not look at them -- a concept known as object permanence. But it was still unknown what babies needed to remember about objects in order to remember their existence. Now Melissa Kibbe, of John Hopkins University, and Alan Leslie, of Rutgers University, are working to figure out exactly what it is that babies remember about objects. For the new study, they showed six-month-old babies two objects, a disk and a triangle. Then they hid the objects behind small screens, first one shape, then the other. Earlier research has shown that young babies can remember what was hidden most recently, but have more trouble remembering the first object that was hidden. Once the shapes were hidden, they lifted the screen in front of the first object. Sometimes they showed babies the shape that was hidden there originally  , but sometimes it was the other shape, and sometimes the object had _ completely. Psychologists   measure how long babies look at something to see how surprised they are. In Kibbe and Leslie's study, babies weren't particularly surprised to see that screen had changed, for example, from a triangle to a disk. But if the object was gone altogether, the babies looked significantly longer, indicating surprise at an unexpected outcome: \"This shows that even though babies don't remember the shape of the object, they know that it should continue to exist,\" Kibbe says. \"They remember the object without remembering the features that identify that object.\" This helps explain how the young brain processes information about objects, Leslie say. He thinks the brain has a structure that acts like a kind of pointer, a mental finger that points at an object. \n Question: Before the study, which of the following was unclear? \n Options: (A) Whether babies know objects are gone.

But modern pirates are not a thing of the past. Last month Somali pirates did their boldest hijacking   to date. They seized the Saudi supertanker   Sirius Star carrying crude oil worth about $100 million. They demanded $15 million to free the ship and its crew. The pirates have kept hitting the headlines this year: 92 attacks have been attempted, with 36 successful hijackings and 268 crew members taken hostage  . The Chinese fishing ship Tianyu 8, with 17 Chinese and 8 foreigners on board, has been in their hands since November 14. Of course piracy   is nothing new. Even since there has been water and ships there have been pirates. The earliest documented history of pirates dates back to the 13thcentury in the Mediterranean Sea. Even the famous Roman emperor Julius Caesar was once kidnapped by pirates. Piracy reached its peak in the mid-1700s. It was during this time in the Caribbean and off the coast of Africa that men like \"Blackbeard the Pirate\" made this profession attractive. But with the creation of stronger national Navies piracy became less popular around the world. In the mid-20thcentury, most pirates were petty   thieves. They used hooks to sneak   on board ships at anchor, and grabbed all that they could find. _  However, nowadays piracy has become a multi-million-dollar business at tracting many in poor countries. Pirates are treated like heroes among local fishermen. They use satellite phones and Global Positioning Systems (GPS). Once they spot their target, they swarm the ship with fast boats and shoot it by firing AK-47s or even rocket-propelled grenades  . Then they hold the ship and its crews for money. \"The world should take forceful actions together to fight piracy,\" said leaders at the Asian and Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Peru. \"However, putting in anti-piracy army can only be half of the solution. We have to protect the fair chance of Somali fishermen to get a good living and keep them from the lure of easy money,\" said Peter Lehr, a lecturer in terrorism studies. \n Question: When did piracy reach its peak? \n Options: (A) In the 13\nthcentury.

Many people think that gorillas are very fierce. They are often described as standing upright like a man, beating their fists and roaring. In their home, in the forests of Central Africa, however, they are not at all like this, They are peaceful animals and never use their great strength unless attacked. Even then, they retreat if they can.     Gorillas have black faces and long, black, hairy coats. They feed during the day on plants and fruit.

Not long after his tenth birthday Peter was entrusted to take her to school. It was only two stops down the road , but the way his parents kept going on about it , you might have thought Peter was taking Kate to the North Pole . He was given instructions the night before. When he woke up , he had to listen to them over and over again. He was to keep hold of Kate's hand at all times , sit close to the front nearest the window , and tell the bus driver the name of his stop. Peter repeated all this back to his mother and set out for the bus stop with his sister. They held hands all the way. Actually he didn't mind this but simply hoped that none of his friends would see him holding a girl's hand. The bus came. They got on and sat close to the front. It was ridiculous sitting there holding hands and there were some boys from school there, so they let go of each other. Peter was feeling proud of himself. He could take care of his sister anywhere. If they were alone tighter on a mountain pass and came face to face with a pack of hungry wolves, he could know exactly what to do. Taking care and not to make sudden movement, he would move away with Kate until they had their backs to a large rock. That way the wolves would not be able to surround them. Then he takes from his pocket two important things--his hunting knife and a box of matches. He takes the knife from its sheath  and sets it down on the grass, ready in case the wolves attack. They're coming close now. They're so hungry and are watering and growling  . Kate is crying, but he cannot comfort her. He knows he has to concentrate on his plan. Right at their feet are some dry leaves and twigs. Quickly and skillfully, Peter gathers them into a small pile. The wolves are edging closer. He has to get this right. There's only one match left in the box. He bends down, cups his hand and lights the match. There's strong rush of wind. The flame flickers, but Peter holds it close to the pile and then first one leaf, then another, then the end of a twig catch fire, and soon the little pile is burning. He piles on more leaves and twigs and larger sticks. The wolves are backing off. Wild animals are terrified of fire. The flames are leaping higher and the wind is carrying the smoke right into their jaws. Now Peter takes holds of the hunting knife and ... Ridiculous! A daydream like this could make him miss his stop if he wasn't careful. The bus had come to a halt. The kids from his school were already getting off. Peter leaped to his feet and just managed to jump to the pavement as the bus was starting off again. It was more than fifty yards down the road when he realized he had forgotten something. Was it his backpack ? No. It was his sister. He had saved her from the wolves and left her sitting there. For a moment, he couldn't move.

Here's what you need to know to avoid tragedy: *      Drowning: Each year, thousands of children die from drowning, with two-thirds of accidents occurring in the summer. To protect kids, parents should install multiple layers of protective devices, with each layer offering another opportunity to avoid a tragedy. Fences, door alarms, pool covers are all somewhat effective individually, but their effectiveness is increased dramatically when used in combination with one another. *      Falls: Falls from heights kill 140 children under the age of 15 each year in the United States, and seriously injure three million more, making falls the leading cause of non-deadly injury for this age group. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), falls are especially a problem for children living in multi-story housing during the summer months, when windows are open and children are more likely to be playing on fire escapes, roofs and balconies. To keep kids safe, AAP recommends window guards be installed on second story and higher windows. When choosing guards, install those that are operable in the event of emergencies like a house fire. Using childproof gates can prevent falls down stairways. Nevertheless, no gate can replace parental supervision   *      Bikes: Bike accidents kill over 1,500 children aged 14 and under each year. Of these deaths, more than half occurred during the summer. According to the AAP, head injuries from cycling are the most common cause of disability. A recent study in Seattle, Washington showed that helmets reduced the risk of head injury by 85 percent and brain injury by 88 percent. When purchasing a bike helmet, parents are urged to make sure it meets the bicycle helmet safety standards of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) *      Pedestrian: Over 6,000 kids aged 14 and under die every year as a result of an unintentional pedestrian-related injury. As a general rule, kids under 10 should not be crossing the street alone. Young children lack the ability to judge the speed and the distance of oncoming traffic. Parents need be models and teach proper pedestrian behavior.

His father was a maker and mender of pots and kettles, and the son followed the same trade. Though he is usually called a tinker, Bunyan had a settled home and place of business. He had little schooling, and he describes his early surroundings as poor and mean. He became much interested in religions, but it was only after a tremendous spiritual conflict, lasting three or four years, that he found peace. His struggles are related with extraordinary vividness and intensity in his \"Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners.\" His writing began with a controversy against the Quakers  , and shows from the first the command of a homely but vigorous style. Like most working men at the time, Bunyan had a deep hatred for the corrupted, hypocritical rich who accumulated their wealth \"by hook and by crook.\" As a stout Puritan , he had made a conscientious study of the Bible and firmly believed in salvation   through spiritual struggle. Bunyan's style was modeled after that of the English Bible. With his concrete and living language and carefully observed and vividly presented details, he made it possible for the reader of the least education to share the pleasure of reading his novel and to relive the experience of his characters. Bunyan's works include Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners (1666), The Life and Death of Mr. Badman (1680), The Holy War (1682) and The Pilgrim's Progress (1684). The Pilgrim's Progress is the most successful religious allegory   in the English language. Its purpose is to urge people to observe Christian doctrines and seek salvation through constant struggle with their own weaknesses and all kinds of social evils. It is not only about something spiritual but also bears much relevance to the time. Its predominant metaphor -- life as a journey -- is simple and familiar. The objects that Christian meets are homely and commonplace, and the scenes presented are typical English ones, but throughout the allegory a spiritual significance is added to the commonplace details. Here the strange is combined with the familiar and the trivial joined to the divine, and, a rich imagination and a natural talent for storytelling also contribute to the success of the work which is at once entertaining and morally instructive. \"The Vanity Fair,\" is an excerpt from The Pilgrim's Progress. The story starts with a dream in which the author sees Christian the Pilgrim, with a heavy burden on his back, reading the Bible. When he learns from the book that the city in which he and his family live shall be burnt down in a fire, Christian tries to convince his family and his neighbors of the oncoming disaster and asks them to go with him in search of salvation, but most of them simply ignore him. So he starts off with a friend, Pliable. Pliable turns back after they stumble into a pit, the Slough of Despond. Christian struggles on by himself. Then he is misled by Mr. Wordly Wiseman and is brought back onto the right road by Mr. Evangelist. There he joins Faithful, a neighbor who has set out later but has made better progress. The two go on together through many adventures, including the great struggle with Apollyon, who claims them to be his subjects and refuse to accept their allegiance to God. After many other adventures they come to the Vanity Fair where both are arrested as alien agitators. They are tried and Faithful is condemned to death. Christian, however manages to escape and goes on his way, assisted by a new friend, Hopeful. Tired of the hard journey, they are tempted to take pleasant path and are then captured by Giant Despair. Finally they get away and reach the Celestial City, where they enjoy eternal life in the fellowship of the blessed. \n Question: According to the passage, Bunyan hated the rich people mainly because   _  . \n Options: (A) his father was making and mending pots and kettles (B) Bunyan had poor and mean early surroundings (C) the rich usually got their wealth in dishonest ways (D) Bunyan studied the Bible to save the human souls", "output": "C", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

That means letting children get a little dirty might be good for their health later in life.  The study involved laboratory mice. It found that adult mice raised in a germ-free environment were more likely to develop allergies, asthma  and other autoimmune disorders. There are more than eighty disorders where cells that normally defend the body instead attack tissues and organs.  Richard Blumberg,who led the study,is a professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston,Massachusetts. He says,in 1989,medical researchers who sought to explain these diseases, first discovered that the increasing use of antibacterial soaps and other products, especially early in life, could weaken immune systems.  Now, Dr. Blumberg and his team have what is the first biological evidence to link early exposure to germs to stronger adult immune systems. They say this exposure could prevent the development of some autoimmune diseases.  In the adult germ-free mice, they found that inflammation in the lungs and colon  was caused by so-called killer T cells. These normally fight infection. But they became overactive and targeted healthy tissue--an autoimmune condition seen in asthma and a disease called ulcerative colitis .  Dr. Blumberg says the mice raised in a normal environment did not have the same reaction. He says their immune systems had been \"educated\" by early exposure to germs.  Rates of autoimmune disorders are rising worldwide, but mostly in wealthier, industrialized countries. According to Dr. Blumberg, it might be high time that people were warned to be more careful with the early use of antibiotics  and the prescription from their doctors.

The story has been read by millions since it was first published and in the last hundred years it has been made into dozens of movies. Many people are surprised to learn its writer was a 19-year-old woman, called Mary Shelley. Mary was born into a rich London family in August 1797. She was educated by her parents and when she was 13 she decided to become a writer. In 1812, she met the famous writer Percy Shelley and they soon got married. Sadly for Mary, their first child died soon after birth in Italy. In her diary, Mary wrote about a dream:\"I dreamt that my little baby came to life again---that it had only been cold and that we rubbed it before the fire and it lived.\" In 1816, Percy Shelley and 19-year-old Mary visited the poet Lord Byron at his home in Switzerland. Because of the bad weather they stayed indoors reading horror stories. On night, Byron asked everyone to write their own story. Mary thought of her dream and wrote the story ofFrankenstein Frankensteinwas published when Mary was 21, and became a huge success. Many people didn't think a 19-year-old woman could write so well and believed her husband was the real writer. Although famous, Shelley's life was full of sadness. Only one of her four children lived and in 1822 her husband died in a swimming accident. Mary was broken-hearted and decided not to marry again.

People are happier and laugh 50% more when they talk face to face with friends or via webcam (web camera) than when they use social networking sites, a study has found. Dr. Roberts, a famous lecture at the University of Chester, said such websites don't appear to help make true friendships. Based on two questionnaires , he found there was no link between Facebook use and people with larger groups of friends. Dr. Roberts, whose work will be presented at the British Psychological Society conference in Harrogate, said, \"The bottom lime conclusion is that our relationships are not dependent on the quantity of communication. They depend on quality, and even Skype  is better at increasing the quality of our communication than time on Facebook.\" Even talking on the phone or texting does not make people feel as good as sharing a smile, the research says. The studies suggest quality, not quantity, of communication is the most important for keeping friends for life. People find the most satisfying relationships come from a small number of close friends, with an outer \"ring\" of 10 significant others.

If  your school does not have these offices, you can just quickly have a look on the Internet and find a wide variety of scholarships you might qualify for.    The credentials you need to be considered for a scholarship vary greatly. But, to be a candidate for any scholarship, you generally need to have good grades, be an outstanding person, and be able to take full advantage of the opportunities presented to you. You will be able to show why you are a good candidate through the application process.     The application process for each scholarship varies, which usually includes submitting  an academic record, an essay, and sometimes an interview. Usually, you will have to submit your academic records. The administrators of the scholarship will know that you take your academic studies seriously. Next you usually need to write an essay. This could be on a wide variety of subjects, but they usually focus on something related to 'why you should get this scholarship' to determine how much you want the scholarship and how good of a candidate you would be. After this, the final few applicants may be asked in for an interview to learn about you and why you would be a good recipient  of the scholarship. If you satisfy all these requirements, there is a good chance you will get a scholarship.

Teachers teach and students learn, and many scientists are interested in finding ways to improve both teaching and learning processes.      Sian Beilock and Susan Leving, two psychologists at the University of Chicago, are trying to learn about learning. In a new study about the way kids learn math in primary school, Beilock and Levine found a surprising relationship between what female teachers think and what female students learn: If a female teacher is uncomfortable with her own math skills, then her female students are more likely to believe that boys are better than girls at math. \"If these girls keep getting math-anxious female teachers in later grades,  _ ,\" Levine told Science News. The study suggests that if these girls grow up believing that boys are better at math than girls are, then these girls may not do as well as they would have if they were more confident.      Just as students find certain subjects to be difficult, teachers can find certain subjects to be difficult to learn--and teach. The subject of math can be particularly difficult for everyone.      The new study involved 65 girls, 52 boys and 17 first-and second-grade teachers in primary schools in the Midwest. The students took math achievement tests at the beginning and end of the school year, and the researchers compared the scores.      The researchers also gave the students tests to tell whether the students believed a math superstar had to be a boy. Then the researchers turned to the teachers: To find out which teachers were anxious about math, the researchers asked the teachers how they felt at times when they came across math, such as when reading a sales receipt . A teacher who got nervous looking at the numbers on a sales receipt, for example, was probably anxious about math.      Boys, on average, were unaffected by a teacher's anxiety. On average, girls with math-anxious teachers scored lower on the end-of-the-year math tests than other girls in the study did. Plus, on the test showing whether someone thought a math superstar had to be a boy, 20 girls showed feeling that boys would be better at math--and all of these girls had been taught by female teachers with math anxiety.      According to surveys done before this one, college students who want to become primary school teachers have the highest levels of anxiety about math.

But there are some people who seem able to \"fast\" for very long periods. Various records are claimed for long fast, but in most cases there is no medical proof and so the records are doubtful. One South African woman claimed that she lived for 102 days on nothinig but water and soda water. There are great differences among living things in the ability to survive without food. For example , a tick , which lives on animals, may survive a whole year. Warm-blooded animals use up their stores of food in the body more quickly. In fact, the smaller and more active the animal, the more quickly it uses up its reserves. A small bird starves to death in about five days, a dog in about twenty. In general, we can say that a warm-blooded creature will die when it has lost about half its normal weight. This matter of weight is important. Man and other creatures live in a state of metabolic equiplibrium which means maintaining the body weight once a certain point has been reached. This regulation of body weight is done by thirst, hunger, and appetite. When your blood lacks nutritional materials, this registers in the hunger center of the brain and you feel \"hungry\". The body is crying out for any kind of fuel(food). And it is our appetite that sees to it hat we chooose a mixed diet, which is the kind the body needs. \n Question: According to this passage, a man will die    _   . \n Options: (A) when a certain point in losing weight has been reached.

The same comment is made from generation to generation and it is always true. It has never been truer than it is today. The young are better educated. They have a lot more money to spend and enjoy more freedom. They grow up more quickly and are not so dependent on their parents. They think more for themselves and do not blindly accept the life goals of their elders. Events which the older generation remembers vividly are nothing more than past history. This is as it should be. Every new generation is different from the one before. Today the difference is very noticeable indeed. The old always believe that they know best for the simple reason that they have been around a bit longer. They don't like to feel that their values are being questioned or threatened. And this is exactly what the young are doing. Wouldn't people work best if they were given complete freedom and responsibility? And what about clothing? Who said that all the men in the world should wear dull grey suits and very short haircuts? Who said that human differences can best be solved through normal politics or by violent means? Why have the older generation so often used violence to solve their problems? Why are they so unhappy and guilty in their personal lives, so occupied with mean ambitions and the desire to collect more and more wealth? Haven't the old lost touch with all that is important in life? These are not questions the older generation can shrug off lightly. Their record over the past forty years or so hasn't been exactly spotless. Traditionally, the young have turned to their elders for guidance. Today, the situation might be opposite. The old--if they are prepared to admit it--could learn a thing or two from their children. One of the biggest lessons they could learn is that enjoyment is not wrong. Enjoyment is a principle one could apply to all aspects of life. It is surely not wrong to enjoy your work and enjoy your free time. It is surely not wrong to live in the present rather than in the past or future. This emphasis on the present is only to be expected because the young have grown up under the shadow of the bomb: the constant threat of complete annihilation  .

Many cities are recognized across the world by their unofficial names. New York is the Big Apple, London is the Big Smoke, and Los Angeles is famously called La La Land. A project has been carried out to make a survey on how the nicknames of some places came about. The University of Winchester's Professor Bill Lucas is a patron   of the English Project. He explains that unofficial place names often show what people think about a place. \"The name that people create for a place forms a connection with feelings,\" he says. Basingstoke is a town in central England. The local nickname, Amazingstoke, shows the love that locals seem to have for the area. Swindon, on the other hand, is sometimes called Swindump, showing that some people think it's a dump  . Stanford Le Hope in Essex is called Stanford No Hope by locals. And Padstow in Cornwall is so closely connected with the local famous person Rick Stein that it's become known as Padstein. Some people say that the project may have a practical use.

I also didn't like the fact that people seemed very close-minded. I felt trapped. I felt like I was missing out on opportunities. It seemed to me that city life would be the opposite. Then I took my first trip to New York City. I couldn't wait to experience the city. However, when I arrived in the Big Apple, it wasn't at all what I had imagined. I knew it was home to thousands of people, but I hadn't had the least expectation to see so many people on the street at one time. All the streets were filled with people. I also felt a little surprised to see that everyone was in a hurry and everything moved at such a fast pace. When I took the subway for the first time, I said hello to the middle-aged woman next to me. She looked at me with dislike and didn't say a word.

The course is one of the most popular in the prison. Prisoners have to earn the right to attend the course and they work hard to get in. One reason why the course is so popular is that many prisoners find it easier to connect with animals than with people, because animals don't judge them. They trust animals in ways they don't with humans. Yet, they hold a misunderstanding of how animals treat one another. Many admit that their own \"animal behavior\" is what got them into trouble in the first place. I teach that though there is competition and aggression in the animal kingdom, there is also a lot of cooperation and sympathy. Many of the students want to build healthy relationships, and they find that the class helps them. I use examples of the social behavior of group-living animals such as wolves as a model for developing and maintaining friendships among people who must work together for their own good and also for the good of the group. It's clear that science inspires the students here and it also gives them hope. I know some students have gone back into education after their being set free while others have gone to work for humane societies or contributed time and money to conservation organizations. One went on to receive a master's degree in nature writing. Science and humane education help the prisoners connect with values that they otherwise would not have done. It opens the door to understanding, trust, cooperation and hope. There's a large population of people to whom science could mean a lot, if only they could have access to it. The class helps me, too.

On www.qq.com and www.sina.com, two popular web portals in the country, internet users have contributed some 2,000 poems and 5000 drawings on the theme of Chang'e I. \"The satellite launch means much more than just saying 'hello' to the moon. Maybe in the future we could also send some people to accompany sister 'Chang'e',\" said a college student in the survey. Remarkably, many people expect to visit the moon one day, with 93.4 percent of respondents saying they expected to do so. Chang'e I is named after Chang'e, a famous character from Chinese mythology. She ascended from earth to live on the moon as a celestial being after drinking an elixir. There is also another connection between the moon and China. In the 1970s, a crater on the moon was named after a Chinese stargazer, Wan Hu, who is said to be the first astronaut in human history. Legend says about 600 years ago, around the middle of the Ming Dynasty, Wan Hu, a local government official, tried to fly into space with the help of a chair, two big kites and 47 self-made gunpowder-filled rockets. According to the legend after the rockets were lit there was a huge bang and lots of smoke. When the smoke cleared Wan was nowhere to be found.

So does the Spanish crisis suggest that monarchy  is seeing its last days? Does that mean the writing is on the wall for all European royals, with their magnificent uniforms and majestic lifestyles? The Spanish case provides arguments both for and against monarchy. When public opinion is particularly polarized, as it was following the end of the Franco regime, monarchs can rise above mere politics and symbolize a spirit of national unity. It is this apparent transcendence  of politics that explains monarchs continuing popularity as heads of state. And so, the Middle East excepted, Europe is the most monarch- filled region in the world, with 10 kingdoms (not counting Vatican City and Andorra). Most royal families have survived because they allow voters to avoid the difficult search for a non-controversial but respected public figure. Even so, kings and queens undoubtedly have a downside. Symbolic of national unity as they claim to be, their very history and sometimes the way they behave today symbolizes outdated and indefensible privileges and inequalities. At a time when Thomas Piketty and other economists are warning of rising inequality and the increasing power of inherited wealth, it is strange that wealthy noble families should still be the symbolic heart of modern democratic states. The most successful monarchies try their best to abandon or hide their old noble ways. Princes and princesses have day-jobs and ride bicycles, not horses (or helicopters).

She worked at several lower-paid jobs, relocated to a new city and even declared bankruptcy. Then in December, she finally moved back into her parents' home at age 52. \"I'm back living in the bedroom that I grew up in,\" she said.    Taking shelter with parents isn't uncommon for young people, especially when the job market is poor. But now the declining economy is forcing some children to do so later in life---even at middle age.    Financial planners report receiving many calls from parents seeking advice about taking in their grown children after divorces and lay-offs. Kim Erickson, a financial planner in California, said she has never seen older children, even those at 50, depending so much on their parents as in the last six months. \"These are 40-and-50-year-old children of my clients that they're helping out. We have a hard time saying no as a culture to our children, and they keep asking for more,\" she said.    Bauer's parents won't take rent money. She's trying to save several hundred dollars a month for a house while working as a meeting coordinator. Bauer would prefer to live on her own, but without her parents' help, she would \"probably be renting again,\" she said. \"Buying groceries for another person isn't stretching my budget too much,\" said her mother, Shirley Smith, aged 80.    Parents usually feel guilty if they don't offer help. But a large number of  well-meaning parents must delay retirement or scale back their dreams because they have to help their children, Erickson said. And the sliding economy might threaten their jobs.    \"I almost have to act like a financial therapist,\" she said to Shirley. \"Here is the line I'm drawing for you. That's fine.

The material's inventors say it has a number of possible uses and someday could provide a more environmentally friendly alternative to plastic. The material, made from shrimp (') shells and proteins produced from silk, is called \"shrilk.\" It is thin, clear, flexible and strong. A major benefit of the material is its biodegradability. Plastic's toughness and flexibility represented a revolution in materials science during the 1950s and '60s. Decades later, however, plastic's very durability   is raising questions about how appropriate it is for one-time products such as plastic bags, or short-lived consumer goods, used in the home for a few years and then cast into a landfill where they will degrade for centuries. What is the point of making something that lasts 1,000 years? Shrilk not only will degrade in a landfill, but its basic components are used as fertilizer , and so will enrich the soil. Shrilk has great potential, the inventors said. Materials from which it is made are plentiful in nature, found in everything ranging from shrimp shells, insect bodies to living plants. That makes shrilk low cost, and its mass production possible should it be used for products demanding a lot of material. Work on shrilk is continuing in the lab. The inventors said the material becomes flexible when wet, so they're exploring ways to use it in wet environments. They're also developing simpler production processes, which could be used for non-medical products, like for computer cases and other products inside the home. They're even exploring combining it with other materials, like carbon fibers, to give it new properties. \n Question: What has become a concern about plastic? \n Options: (A) Using it properly.

The bridge, which has attracted international attention, is now a local landmark. The Nutty Narrows Bridge was built in 1963 by a local builder, Amos Peters, to give squirrels a way to cross the busy road without getting flattened by passing cars. The original bridge was built over Olympia Way on the west edge of the library grounds. Before the bridge was built, squirrels had to avoid traffic to and from the Park Plaza office building where office staff put out a nutty feast for the squirrels. Many times, Peters and others who worked in and near Park Plaza witnessed squirrels being run over. One day Peters found a dead squirrel with a nut still in its mouth, and that day's coffee break discussion turned into squirrel safety. The group of businessmen cooked up the squirrel bridge idea and formed a committee to ask the blessing of the City Council .The Council approved, and Councilwoman Bess LaRiviere named the bridge \"Nutty Narrows.\" After architects designed the bridge, Amos Peters and Bill Hutch started Construction, They built the 60-foot bridge from aluminum and lengths of fire hose . It cost 1,000. It didn't take long before reports of squirrels using the bridge started. Squirrels were even seen guiding their young and teaching them the ropes. The story was picked up by the media, and Nutty Narrows became know in newspapers all over the world. In 1983, after 20 years of use, Peters took down the worn-out bridge. Repairs were made and crosspieces were replaced. The faded sign was repainted and in July 1983, hundreds of animal lovers attended the completion ceremony of the new bridge. Peters died in 1984, and a ten-foot wooden squirrel sculpture was placed near the bridge in memory of its builder and his devotion to the project. \n Question: The Nutty Narrows Bridge was built in order to   _  . \n Options: (A) offer squirrels a place to eat nuts (B) set up a local landmark (C) help improve traffic (D) protect squirrels", "output": "D", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

The French culture didn' t interest me that much, and Paris seemed too big, too touristy, too much. But when I found myself standing next to the Opera National de Paris, completely alone and totally lost, I knew I was in for an interesting ride. I had decided to take a summer history class abroad, and Paris just happened to be where it was set. My teacher eventually found me and other jet-lagged students and walked us down to where we would be staying. Even then, tired, hungry, and feeling displaced, I was unable to keep myself from marveling at the beauty of the city. The next day in the grocery store, trying to decide if the box I was holding contained butter or cream cheese, I suddenly realized I was a foreigner that didn't speak the language.The cashier and I had a conversation completely with gestures. For the most part, it didn't seem to bother the French that I was utterly incompetent in speaking their language. In fact, from my first unclear \"bonjour\" , many of them would directly switch over to English. Time Hew by. In the mornings we had class, and in the afternoons we were given a lot of freedom to do what we pleased. We explored everywhere in the city, becoming experts at using the Metro, and walking so much that our legs were sore every night. Living in Paris was a huge change in my lifestyle. Everything I did was more relaxed. I stopped worrying about the future and instead focused on living in the present. I stopped wearing a watch because time didn't matter.We ate when we were hungry, went to bed when we were tired and explored in between.I no longer mind that Paris is so big; it' s an old, beautiful metropolis full of culture and history.On one of my last days there, standing on top of the Arc du Triumph with a 360 degree view of Paris, I finally admitted something to myself.The city that I had never wanted to visit had turned into the city that I never wanted to leave. \n Question: The writer came to Paris because   _  . \n Options: (A) he wanted to have an interesting ride (B) he attended a course in summer (C) he admired its beautiful scenery (D) he was alone and lost his way", "output": "B", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

Step 1: Gear up! Even before you put on your skates, put on all your safety gear . Step 2: Buckle up! Strap on your skates. Make sure they fit well and are snugly around your ankles. This helps your ankles stay strong and straight. Step 3: Fall down! You probably do not usually try to fall. But it is good to practice falling on skates. Fall forward onto your knee pads. Put out your hands and let your wrist guards hit the ground. See? Are you surprised that it doesn't hurt? Practice falling until it is easy to fall forward and get up again. If you are not afraid to fall, you will try new things. Knowing how to fall will help you be a better skater and find your balance. When you can stay balanced, you won't fall as much. Step 4: Stop! Make sure you can stop on your skates. The quickest and safest is probably the brake stop. The brake is usually on the back of the right skate. The brake stop: Roll forward with your skates pointing the same way. Let your right skate roll a little forward. Bend your knees as if you are sitting down. Then press your right heel down hard. This will make your brake pad drag on the ground until you stop. The T stop: Roll forward with your skates pointing the same way. Then turn your right foot out so the toes are pointing to your right. Drag your right skate. Let the wheels drag on the ground until you come to a stop. Another way to stop is to run or jump onto the grass. Step 5: Roll around! Find a flat, smooth place to practice. Do not skate in streets. Parks and playgrounds are good places to practice. Look for \"No skating\" signs to make sure you can skate there. \n Question: According to the article, which of these steps are most important for a new skater? \n Options: (A) Learn to fall and stop safely.

After all, you probably sing or whistle when you are happy.    Some scientists believe that birds do sing some of the time just because they are happy. However, they sing most of the time for a very different reason. Their singing is actually a warning to other birds to stay out of their territory.    Do you know what a 'territory' is? A territory is an area that an animal, usually the male, claims   as its own. Only he and his family are welcome there. No other families of the same species  are welcome. Your yard and house are your territory where only your family and friends are welcome. If a stranger enter your territory and threaten you, you may shout. Probably this is enough to frighten him away.    If so, you have actually scared the stranger away without having to fight him. A bird does the same thing. But he expects an outsider almost any time, especially at nesting season. So he is screaming all the time, whether he can see an outsider or not. This screaming is what we call a bird's song, and it is usually enough to keep an outsider away.    Birds sing loudest in the spring when they are trying to attract a mate and warn others not to enter the territory of theirs.    You can see that birds have a language of their own.

On the other hand, most car accidents happen to men; very few happen to women. From this, we can see that women are much more careful while driving.

Somehow they were prevented from making this step in their lives, but nowadays there are many women that want to pass their driving tests from an early age. However, we have to admit that men are more skillful drivers than women, but this does not mean that a woman cannot become a good driver by accumulating   experience. So more and more teenagers and women around the age of thirty now want to pass their driving tests. While taking their driving lessons, they also have a number of special lessons with their parents or somebody in the family that has a driving license, this is just to improve their driving abilities and help them to pass the tests more easily.

Now, a web company has taken on the task of saving the language by marrying history with technology. Silbo Gomero, a language used only on La Gomera Island, sounds to the untrained ear like few other known languages. The sounds that make up this language are made by whistling, rather than by speaking. The language was brought to the island by African setters many centuries ago. To communicate among the  _ populated inland hills and valleys, shepherds   had to use the whistled language, which could be heard and understood over distances of up to eight kilometers, compared to about 200 meters for a spoken word. With the development of new technologies like the cellphone, the number of Silbo Gomero whistlers has declined to around 1,000. Many of the older generation of islanders fear the language, which they consider to be a cultural symbol, may become extinct. To save Silbo Gomero, Busuu.com, a website based in Madrid, has launched a movement to teach Internet users worldwide to communicate using the language's unique whistles. \"We really like the whole story of Silbo Gomero because it is really a fun language, \" said Bernard Niesner, the company's co-founder.  Niesner says one of the founding principles of the website was to promote learning languages in danger of extinction. \"If Busuu.com really works out like we think, it would be an amazing tool for language learning all over the world,\" Niesner said. \"The name of our website itself comes from Busuu, a language that is spoken by only eight people.\" \n Question: Compared to other languages, Silbo Gomero is special because it   _  . \n Options: (A) has a very long story.

And this year's top honor goes to \"selfie\". The frequency of the word selfie used in the English language has increased by 17,000 per cent since this time last year. This figure is calculated by Oxford Dictionaries using a research program which collects around 150 million English words currently in use from around the web every month. To qualify, a word need not have been invented within the past 12 months but it does need to stand out or become notable at that time. Selfie is defined by Oxford Dictionaries as: \"A photograph that one has taken of oneself, typically one taken with a smart phone or webcam and uploaded to a social media website.\" Oxford Dictionaries said the earliest known usage is an Australian online forum post in 2002. A man posted a picture of injuries to his face when he tripped over some steps. He apologized for the fact that the picture was out of focus, saying that it was not because he was drunk but because it was a selfie. Judy Pearsall, editorial director for Oxford Dictionaries, said: \"Using the Oxford Dictionaries language research program, we can see a phenomenal upward trend in the use of selfie in 2013, and this helped to win its selection as Word of the Year.\" She also added: \"Social media sites helped to popularize the term, with selfie appearing on the photo-sharing website Flicker as early as 2004, but usage wasn't widespread until around 2012, when selfie was being used commonly in mainstream media sources.\" Selfies have taken the world by storm. Everyone from the first family to ordinary people has taken the time to pose for a selfie.

The first sensible lesson is that you shouldn't bother trying to find your way in the dark at all, but just stay put until dawn. Because then you won't trip over things? No, mainly because you'll have an idea of direction. The sun rises in the east. But you will be amazed at how many people forget they know that. Apparently, the area underneath a holly bush provides a good makeshift shelter -- they are thick, and evergreen. The next thing to do -- or rather not to do -- is panic, for the obvious reason that unless there is someone there to hear you scream, it will get you nowhere. Just try to think of nice, happy things. There is always a point in films when a person who is lost in the desert or the snow, dehydrated  and exhausted, comes across a set of their own footprints and realizes they have just walked in a huge, round circle. It is wrong to owe it to the unequal strengths or different lengths of your legs. Experiments prove that, without the sun or the moon (or landmarks) as a fixed guide, lots of small errors add up over time so the brain can't correctly identify the \"straight ahead\" direction. To just get out of somewhere, pick a spot on the horizon and just head for it. There are several ways to find directions in the dark, and by far the best is to establish north using the stars. Most people can identify the Plough, which is part of Ursa Major. It looks a lot like a saucepan. The Plough rotates through the sky, but let's imagine the saucepan lying horizontally  , with its handle on the left. You need to trace a line from the star at the right-hand base of the pan, through the star at the right-hand rim  , and follow it upwards; the north star is roughly five times the distance between those two \"pointer\" stars. Then drop a vertical line from the North Star to the horizon and that's north. \"Tonight is very cloudy and I can't see the Plough.\" Maybe luckily, it is quite windy. Keep in mind that almost all of our weather comes from a south-westerly direction. (This only works if you are in the British Isles). To find the direction, you can throw light bits of dried-out grass in the air and see which way they blow; or, if there are clouds and patches of clear sky, see which way they blow across the stars. You can also get an idea of direction from leggy plants. If they look as if they have been blown over, they will probably be pointing north-east. If they are simply leaning in one direction as they grow, there's a good chance that is south (they will be reaching towards the sun). The last thing to do is to judge your direction and off you go. \n Question: What might be the best title of the passage ? \n Options: (A) How to survive in the forest (B) How to protect yourself in the forest (C) How to direct your way out of the wild (D) What to do if you are lost", "output": "C", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

They will attend US schools, meet US teenagers, and form impressions of the real America. At the same time, about thirteen hundred American teenagers will go to other countries to learn new languages and gain a new understanding of the rest of the world. Here is a two-way student exchange in action. Fred, nineteen, spent last year in Germany with George's family. In turn, George's son Mike spent a year in Fred's home in America. Fred, a lively young man, knew little German when he arrived, but after two months' study, the language began to come to him. Schools were completely different from what he had expected--much harder. Students rose respectfully when the teacher entered the room. They took fourteen subjects instead of the six that are usual in the United States. There were almost no outside activities. Family life, too, was different. The father's word was law, and all activities were around the family rather than the individual . Fred found the food too simple at first. Also, he missed having a car. \"Back home, you pick up some friends in a car and go out and have a good time. In Germany, you walk, but you soon learn to like it.\" At the same time, In America, Mike, a friendly German boy, was also forming his idea.\"I suppose I should criticize  American schools,\" he says. \"It is far too easy by our level. But I have to say that I like it very much. In Germany we do nothing but study. Here we take part in many outside activities. I think that maybe your schools are better in training for citizens .

Rutgers researchers say those who participated in the study began with 30 minutes of focused attention meditation followed by 30 minutes of oxygen sport.They were told that if their thoughts drifted to the past or the future they should refocus on their breathing,enabling those with depression to accept moment-to-moment changes in attention. Shors,who studies the production of new brain cells in the hippocampus--part of the brain involved in memory and learning--says scientists have shown in animal models that oxygen sport exercise keeps a large number of certain cells alive. The idea for the human intervention came from her laboratory studies,she says,with the main goal of helping individuals acquire new skills so that they can learn to recover from stressful life events. By learning to focus their attention and exercise,people who are fighting depression can acquire new learning skills that can help them process information and reduce the overwhelming recollection of memories from the past,Shors says. \"We know these treatments can be practiced over a lifetime and that they will be effective in improving mental health.\"said Alderman.\"The good news is that this intervention can be practiced by anyone at any time and at no cost.\" \n Question: What made the research so different? \n Options: (A) Adopting a way of meaningful talk.

After all,it'd be a shame to spend all that time finding the best price for your trip,only to lose your cash and credit cards to a thief. Don't let others know that you are new here. You're a tourist. You know that,but you don't want anybody else to know that. Don't unfold your big map on a busy corner. Don't ask strangers on the street for directions. Learn your route ahead of time,and step into a business for directions whenever possible. Avoid flashing your Lonely Planet guidebook around,or publicly referring to your language dictionary when traveling abroad. Keep your friends close and your money closer. A lone traveler equals easy pickings for a seasoned criminal. If you are traveling alone,try to hide that fact. Stick with groups whenever possible and keep information sharing with chatty cab drivers and the like to a minimum. Another thing you don't want to advertise:where you keep your money. A fanny pack  may be convenient,but it means \"I'm not from around here!\" If you have a purse,keep it close to your body,preferably under an item of clothing like a jacket or a sweater so that thieves can't steal it. Be sure that your wallet is in a securely fastened pocket. Or go like 007 with a hidden money belt. How cool is that? Be careful,even in your hotel room. Never blindly answer a knock at your door. If the knocker identifies himself as a hotel employee,call the front desk to confirm. Always make sure your hotel door completely closes when entering or exiting. Don't leave your valuables lying around when you leave for the day. That hotel safe is there for a reason! \n Question: Why shouldn't tourists wear a fanny pack? \n Options: (A) Because it shows that you are not a person around here. (B) Because it is not convenient.

Each hair grows independently of other hairs.Not all hairs experience the same period of growth at the same time.During the period of active growth, which is called Anagen, hair grows at a rate of about or one centimeter a month.About eighty five percent of hair follicles  are going through this process at any given time.This period can last from two to six years. The Catagen period of hair growth comes next.It is then that hair growth begins to slow down.This period usually lasts two or three weeks.Finally, hair growth comes to a complete stop and the hairs begin to fall out.This period is known as Telogen.Once the Telogen period has ended, the hair growth process begins again. So what happens when a person has trouble growing hair or suffers from hair loss? Your genes control how fast or how long your hair will grow.Some people have a longer than usual anagen growth period.These people may be able to grow more hair than the average person. However, others struggle to grow shoulder length hair.These people have a shorter than normal anagen period. Your health can also affect hair growth.Poor nutrition can cause some hair follicles to stop growing or cause the hairs that grow to become weak or thin.Problems with hair growth can result from thyroid (^?K JSO problems or other conditions.Health experts say people who experience a sudden increase in hair loss should seek medical advice. \n Question: How many periods of hair growth are discussed in the passage? \n Options: (A) Two.

Their growls, however, are only partly audible  ; two-thirds of the call is at frequencies that are too low to be picked up by our hearing.

These satellite-based systems provide turn-by-turn directions to help people get to where they want to go. But, they can also cause a lot of problems, send you to the wrong place or leave you completely lost. Many times, the driver is to blame. Sometimes a GPS error is responsible. Most often, says Barry Brown, it is a combination of the two. We spoke to Mr. Brown by Skype  . He told us about an incident involving a friend who had flown to an airport in the eastern United States. There he borrowed a GPS-equipped car to use during his stay. BARRY BROWN: \"And they just plugged in an address and then set off to their destination. And, then it wasn't until they were driving for thirty minutes that they realized they actually put in a destination back on the West Coast where they lived. They actually put their home address in. So again, the GPS is kind of 'garbage in garbage out'.\" Mr Brown says this is a common human error. But, he says, what makes the problem worse has to do with some of the shortcomings, or failures, of GPS equipment. BARRY BROWN: \"One problem with a lot of the GPS units is that they have a very small screen and they just tell you the next turn. Because they just give you the next turn, sometimes that means that it is not really giving you the overview that you would need to know that it's going to the wrong place.\" Barry Brown formerly served as a professor with the University of California, San Diego. While there, he worked on a project with Eric Laurier from the University of Edinburgh. The two men studied the effects of GPS devices on driving by placing cameras in people's cars. They wrote a paper based on their research. It is called \"The Normal, Natural Troubles of Driving with GPS.\" It lists several areas where GPS systems can cause confusion for drivers. These include maps that are outdated, incorrect or difficult to understand. They also include timing issues  related to when GPS commands are given.

That's because it took me six or seven attempts at a second novel before I started and completed this one. *Why do you think you had so many false starts? I would say that my reasons were wrong. I was trying to prove that I wasn't just a mother-daughter storyteller, or I was trying to prove that I didn't just have to write about things that were strictly Chinese or Chinese-American. Those were never the right reasons for writing those early stories. And I could never come up with other better reasons for continuing them. *What kept you going on this book? This book was different because it was based on my mother's real life. The reason for writing it became more personal and emotional. AfterThe Joy Luck Clubcame out, my mother was always explaining to people that she wasn't any of the mothers in that book. And at one point she said to me, \"Next book tells my true story.\" And then she started telling me things I never knew before. She also told me many, many stories, because my mother doesn't generalize . The book really grew out of that. *Have you ever visited China? Yes. I've been there twice: about three years ago and then again last November, both times with my mother and my husband. *Was it difficult to understand the Chinese-American dialect  without sounding like a parody ? No, because it's the language I've heard all my life from my mother. She speaks English as it's direct translation from Chinese. But it's more than that. Her language also has more imagery than English. *Can you think of an example? Somebody might say to me, \"Don't work so hard. You'll kill yourself.\" My mother will say to me,\"Why do you press all your brains out on this page for someone else?\" So it's very vivid. That's the way she talks. *Have many readers told you that the Chinese mother in your book reminded them of the typical Jewish   mother? Many people have told me that. I think the mother-daughter relationship is very intense  in both cases. Culturally there is an acceptance that mothers have the power to tell their children, especially their daughters, how to conduct their lives --- not simply up until the time they are 18, but for the rest of their lives. However, when children grow up in a different culture from their parents',they tend to keep more secrets from their parents. The children think, \"They just wouldn't understand that I had to do this.\" And that can really create a gap, and it can grow as the number of secrets grows. \n Question: Based on the questions in this interview, what do you think Ms Tan' s profession is? \n Options: (A) A journalist.

A man who has not had a chance to go swimming for years can still swim as well as ever when he gets back in the water. He can get on a bicycle after many years and still ride away. He can play catch and hit a ball as well as his son. A mother who has not thought about the words for years can teach her daughter the poem that begins \"Twinkle, twinkle, little star\" or remember the story of Cinderella or Goldilocks and the Three Bears. One explanation is the law of overlearning, which can be stated as follows: Once we have learned something, additional learning trials increase the length of time we will remember it. In childhood we usually continue to practice such skills as swimming, bicycle riding, and playing baseball long after we have learned them. We continue to listen to and remind ourselves of words such as \"Twinkle, twinkle, little star\" and childhood tales such as Cinderella and Goldilocks. We not only learn but overlearn. The multiplication tables are an exception to the general rule. that we forget rather quickly the things that we learn in school, because they are another of the things we overlearn in childhood. The law of overlearning explains why cramming  for an examination, though it may result in a passing grade, is not a satisfactory way to learn a college course. By cramming, a student may learn the subject well enough to get by on the examination, but he is likely soon to forget almost everything he learned. A little overlearning, on the other hand, is really necessary for one's future development \n Question: What's the main idea of Paragraph 1 \n Options: (A) Children have a better memory than grown-ups.

Wearing dirty sneakers and a shirt with holes, Don Robinson is an 81-year-old Missouri businessman. Although he's rich, he didn't use his money to buy himself a grand home. Instead, he used it to buy wild land. Robinson has decided to donate 843 acres of his own personal _ to the Department of Natural Resources after his death, which can then be used to create a new state park. His generous donation is the same size as New York City's Central Park. It is said that it's the largest land donation to happen in the last 25 years. How did he come up with this idea? For Robinson, the idea of donation came from his respect for the land and the environment. He doesn't have children to pass it onto. He hoped that someone would make full use of it, or the land would probably turn into wasteland. A green park filled with trees can at least help deal with global warming, in addition to producing fresh air. Robinson has lived here in a small wooden house since 1964.One room holds his bed, a few chairs and a desk. He said he didn't care how much his donation was worth. Tom Pounders who used to work for Robinson said, \"He doesn't think material objects are important.\" He also recalled that Robinson once repaired a broken tennis shoe with a spare tire. Robinson has just one request for the new park that will be established after his death. He'd like it to be named the Don Robinson State Park. \"There's a lot of Robinsons, but only one me.

The celebrations have ended. And the work for prefix = st1 /USpresident-elect Barack Obama has begun. The 47-year-old politician rose to the highest place because he was against the war inIraqand he planned to fix the difficult economy. But what will the first African-American president do for race relations?   Obama's victory appears to have given blacks and other minorities a true national role model. For years, many looked to athletes, musicians and pop stars for inspiration. As Darius Turner, an African-American high school student in Los Angeles, told the Los Angeles Times, \"Kobe (the basketball player) doesn't have to be everyone's role model anymore.\" A USA Today survey found that two-thirds of Americans believe relations between blacks and whites \"will eventually be worked out\". This is the most hopeful answer since the question was first asked in 1963.   However, it's still too early to tell whether Obama's presidency will solve many of the social problems facing low-income black families.   It's unlikely that Obama will be able to  _ such trends overnight.   However, Bil Banks, an expert of African-American Studies, says that young blacks need to find role models to follow. \"That's not Martin Luther King, and not Barack Obama,\" he told the Los Angeles Times. \"It's actually the people closest to them. Barack only has so much influence.\"   In the opinion of black British politician Trevor Phillips, Obama's rise will contribute more to multiculturalism than to race relations in the US. \n Question: For what reason did Obama win the election? \n Options: (A) He was African-American.

Put in your hands, and it can help you achieve all sorts of things, from learning to code to learning a language. Educational apps are becoming increasingly popular as a supplement , and sometimes as an alternative  , to traditional education. Why? Well, for starters, it's extremely convenient to learn on a pocket-sized device that you already carry around with you at all times. The best apps are also highly interactive and adaptive, _ . But apps, just like textbooks and language lessons, are a medium through which a language can be studied. The way you use them will affect how successful you are. If you flick through a textbook and don't dare say a word in your language lessons, you'll make slow progress. The keen reader who repeats each exercise in the textbook and engages the teacher in the conversation will move ahead. So how do you ensure you get the most out of your app, and what should you consider before you install  one? Before that, a very quick introduction: I developed the following five points from my experience as both a language teacher and learner, and from working in startups in the field of language. I spent six years teaching in Germany and Spain as well as developing a video learning startup. However, I first came to language learning late. I started learning Spanish at 22, and was able to use Spanish and German freely by about 28.

The ancient Zhaozhou stone bridge started to be built in 590 during the Sui Dynasty (581~618) and established in 608.The pioneer for building the bridge was Li Chun who overcame unimaginable difficulties,undergoing all hardships.The location of the bridge is in Zhao County south,Hebei Province.It lay across the Xiaoshui River,far away from the mountains that provided rocky materials.In ancient times,it was such a busy,deep and wide river that could be used as an important carriage to transport heavy rocks and other materials.As we know,no train,no lifting machine could be used to move granite blocks to the construction site.As an intelligent stonemason and engineer,Li Chun worked out his plan and design all from his own direct observation and investigation.It took his whole life-time in completing the great historical project inChina.Nowadays it is not only a historical remarkable model of architecture,but also a brilliant Chinese cultural crystallization  of wisdom. The entire length of the bridge is 50.82 meters with 10 meters width.The whole stone bridge looks like a big bow,the span of which is 37.02 meters,and its height from the top to the surface of water at a regular position is 7.23 meters.The bridge arch seems to be moving smoothly and flatly.The whole arch consists of 28 big granite blocks connected each other tightly together.On both end sides of the general arch there are 4 smaller arches,2 of which on one side,the other 2 on the other side.The smaller arches could be used to decrease the weight of the bridge and save stone materials,and help flood get through easily,which seems to be much prettier.Such a hard-thinking and careful consideration of the engineering article is really a model of design and layout.The span was much wider than the other stone bridge in ancient times all over China. Today Zhaozhou Stone Bridge is one of international cultural relics and perfectly protected and preserved by the concerned administration of China. \n Question: The best title of this passage is   _  . \n Options: (A) Great engineer in ancient China (B) Zhaozhou stone bridge (C) Four great inventions (D) How to build a bridge", "output": "B", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

In the mid-2000s he famously coined the phrase \"mindless eating\"(and wrote a book by that name) to focus attention on all the bad dietary decisions we make without really thinking about them. His new book, Slim by Design: Mindless Eating Solutions for Everyday Life, aims to change the design of restaurants, school lunchrooms, office cafeterias and homes so that the mindless choices we make will be more healthful ones. Some examples: Keep kitchen counters clear. No visible snack food, no bread, no nuts--not even breakfast cereal. In Wansink's research, \"women who had even one box of breakfast cereal that was visible-anywhere in their kitchen--weighed 21 pounds more than their neighbor who didn't.\" Trick yourself into drinking less wine. \"We tend to focus on the height of what we pour and not the width, so we pour 12 percent less wine into taller wineglasses than we pour into wider wineglasses.\" And the shape of the glass is not the only variable that affects how much we drink. Wansink writes: \"Because red wine is easier to see than white wine, we pour 9 percent less red wine whenever we pour a glass.\" Wansink said his researchers also found that people ate less at restaurants when sat in well-lighted areas near windows and doors, than in darker areas or in the back. They ate less if they were offered a doggie bag, or to-go box, before they got their meals: apparently the idea of getting a \"free\" second meal outweighed the impulse  to clean their plates. Workers who frequently ate at their desks weighed 15.4 pounds less, on average, than those who didn't. Fruits and vegetables kept on the top shelf of the refrigerator were eaten at higher rates than those on lower shelves. The point, Wansink says, is to consider findings like those and change your environment or habits. Then you won't have to think about it: You'll just eat less. \n Question: Why did Brian Wansink write Slim by Design: Mindless eating Solutions for Everyday Life? \n Options: (A) Because he wanted people to become thin.

Lots of other people are doing the same thing. And the winner of the \"handathon\" contest is the person who can carry on doing it for the longest time. That person gets to own the car. It still seems to be an easy thing to do. At the beginning it is. Anyone can stand still. But when the contest has been going for four or five days, standing still seems like the most difficult job in the world. And keeping the hand in place over this time becomes an act of serious attention. After a few days, the hand seems to belong to someone else--someone who wants to go home and get some sleep. Competitors are allowed to take a five-minute break every hour to eat, drink or do whatever else is necessary. No one is allowed to lean on the car for support. Winners need to be able to show great powers of attention. They also need to be able to develop special skills. Maybe the popularity of the handathon is due to the fact that it is not necessary to be a trained athlete to enter. Entrants in the Longview handathon certainly don't seem to do much preparation. Most say they will prepare by \"getting lots of sleep\". Others say they will \"eat healthy food\" or \"pray for success\".

Believe it or not, there are some people who actually get paid to do that! According to Reuben Reynoso, a professional mattress tester at San Francisco's McRoskey Mattress Factory that still makes every mattress by hand, it is real work and needs some training. For a start, it's not all about jumping to new heights or doing tricks like professional athletes, but rather about feeling each area of the mattress carefully to detect the filling. In order to do it right, every bit of the mattress has to be tested slowly and deliberately. Over the years, Reynoso has figured out the perfect routine. He begins by placing a protective mat over the mattress so that it doesn't get dirty or absorb the smell from his feet. Then begins the fun---he steps to the middle of an edge and then takes five steps back and five steps forward. In this way, he slowly but surely, covers the entire surface. The key according to him is to find the perfect number of jumps---Too many and he will end up destroying the mattress completely. Too few? And it will not fit into the giant machine for that final sewing! Who knew a job that sounds so simple could have so many skills! While Reuben will not reveal how he got into this profession, he will admit that it is more fun than being a carpenter, roofer, construction worker and railroad engineer---all jobs he has tried previous to finding his true profession! \n Question: We learn from the text that the McRoskey Mattress Factory   _  . \n Options: (A) is the world's oldest mattress factory (B) make mattresses for sports (C) produces mattresses by hand (D) hires athletes as mattress testers", "output": "C", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

His wife, Gerrie, was still working in the local school cafeteria, but it was hard for Dave to find work, and the price of everything was rising. The Fusses were at risk of joining the millions of Americans who have lost their homes in recent years. Then Dave and Gerrie received a timely gift--$7,000, a legacy  from their neighbors Ish and Arlene Hatch, who died in an accident. \"It really made a difference when we were meeting difficulty .\"says Dave. But the Fusses weren't the only folks in Alto and the neighboring town of Lowell to receive unexpected legacy from the Hatches. Dozens of other families were touched by what the Hatches had done. In some cases, it was a few thousand dollars; in others, it was more than $100,000. It surprised nearly everyone that the Hatches had so much money, more than $3 million--they were an elderly couple who lived in an old house on what was left of the family farm. Children of the Great Depression, Ish and Arlene were known for their habit of saving. They preferred comparison shopping and would go from store to store, checking prices before making a new purchase. Through the years, the Hatches paid for local children to attend summer camps when their parents couldn't afford it. \"Ish and Arlene never asked if you needed anything,\" says their friend Sandy Van Weelden, \"They could see things they could do to make you happier, and they would do them.\" Even more extraordinary was that the Hatches gave away their farmland. It was the Hatches' wish that their legacy--a legacy of kindness as much as one of dollars and cents--should enrich the whole community and last for generations to come. Neighbors helping neighbors--that was Ish and Arlene Hatch's story. \n Question: According to the text, the Fusses   _  . \n Options: (A) were employed by a truck company (B) led a difficult life (C) worked in a school cafeteria (D) lost their home", "output": "B", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

Looking at past studies they found that, while heavy drinkers do put on weight; those who drink _ can actually lose weight. A spokesman for the research team at Navarro University in Spain says, \"Light to moderate alcohol intake, especially of wine, may be more likely to protect against, rather than promote, weight gain.\" The International Scientific Forum on Alcohol research reviewed the findings and agreed with most of the conclusions, particularly that data do not clearly indicate if moderate drinking increases weight. Boston University's Dr. Harvey Finkel found that the biologic mechanisms relating alcohol to changes in body weight are not properly understood. His team pointed out the strong protective effects of moderate drinking on the risk of getting conditions like diabetes , which relate to increasing obesity. Some studies suggest that even very obese people may be at lower risk of diabetes if they are moderate drinkers. The group says alcohol provides calories that are quickly absorbed into the body and a enot stored in fat, and that this process could explain the differences in its effects from those of other foods. They agree that future research should be directed towards assessing the roles of different types of alcoholic drinks, taking into consideration drinking patterns and including the past tendency of participants to gain weight. For now there is little evidence that consuming small to moderate amounts of alcohol on a regular basis increases one's risk of becoming obese. What's more, a study three years ago suggested that resveratrol, a compound present in grapes and red wine destroys fat cells. \n Question: The passage is mainly for those  _  . \n Options: (A) who produce wine (B) who have a drinking habit (C) who go on a diet (D) who are eager to lose weight", "output": "B", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

Before the nineteenth century scientists with an interest in the sea were few and far between. Certainly Newton considered some theoretical aspects of it in his writings, but he was reluctant to go to sea to further his work.  For most people the sea was remote, and with the exception of early intercontinental travelers or others who earned a living from the sea, there was little reason to ask many questions about it, let alone to ask what lay beneath the surface. The first time that the question \"What is at the bottom of the oceans?\" had to be answered with any commercial consequence was when the laying of a telegraph cable from Europe to America was proposed. The engineer had to know the depth profile   of the route to estimate the length of cable that had to be manufactured.  It was to Maury of the US Navy that the Atlantic Telegraph Company turned, in l853, for information on this matter. In the 1840s, Maury had been responsible for encouraging voyages during which soundings   were taken to investigate the depths of the North Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Later, some of his findings aroused much popular interest in his book The Physical Geography of the Sea.  The cable was laid, but not until 1866 was the connection made permanent and reliable. At the early attempts, the cable failed and when it was taken out for repairs it was found to be covered in living growths, a fact which defied contemporary scientific opinion that there was no life in the deeper parts of the sea.  Within a few years oceanography was under way. In 1872 Thomson led a scientific expedition, which lasted for four years and brought home thousands of samples from the sea. Their classification and analysis occupied scientists for years and led to a five-volume report, the last volume being published in l895. \n Question: The proposal to lay a telegraph cable from Europe to America made oceanographic studies take on   _  . \n Options: (A) a business aspect (B) a military aspect (C) an academic aspect (D) an international aspect", "output": "A", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

The 26-year-old post-graduate has always wanted to work in public service. But public service doesn't pay much, and her two-year program at Columbia costs about $50,000 a year with living expenses. She has a scholarship from Columbia that covers just $4,000 a year and has taken out loans to pay for the rest. She worries that she will spend years paying back her student loans and not have money left over to put away in an IRA. Wheeler is wondering what she can do to ease the pain of    being in debt. Is there anything she can do to handle the debt? The good news is that in 2007, Congress recognized that there were so many students in Wheeler's position that it passed the College Cost Reduction and Access Act. There were two programs established by this act that Wheeler should look into. The first is the income-based repayment plan, which allows lower-income graduates with a lot of debt to reduce their monthly payments. Depending on a graduate's income and level of debt, the program, which goes into effect July 1, could limit his or her annual educational loan debt repayment to 15 percent of discretionary income ,said Peter Mazareas, vice charman of the College Saving Foundation. The second is the public service loan forgiveness plan, in which the federal government will forgive the remaining debt of borrowers who make 10-year loan payment while working full time in public-service jobs. But the graduate must have a certain loan which is listed in the plan. Depending on the level of debt Wheeler ends up with and how much she repays over 10 years, Mazareas said she could end up with about $75,000 of her debt forgiven. \" Tipically, it is projected that a borrower who performs public service under this program will repay only about one-fourth to one-half as much money as a borrower who does not\", he said. He also pointed out that public service is broadly defined and includes any government and nonprofit organization job. \n Question: How much debt will Erin Wheeler be probably in when she graduate? \n Options: (A) $ 8,000 (B) $ 50,000 (C) $75,000 (D) $92,000", "output": "D", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

Call it what you will: the service economy, the information age, the knowledge society. It has changed the way we work. Already we're partly there. The percentage of people who earn their living by making things has fallen dramatically in the Western World. Today the majority of jobs in America, Europe and Japan (two thirds or more in many of these countries) are in the service industry, and the number is on the rise. More women are in the work force than ever before. There are more part-time jobs. More people are self-employed. But the breadth   of the economic transformation can't be measured by numbers alone, because it also is giving rise to a basic new way of thinking about the nature of work itself. Long-held concepts about jobs and careers, the skills needed to succeed, even the relation between individuals and employers -- all these are being challenged. We have only to look behind us to get some sense of what may lie ahead. No one looking ahead 20 years possibly could have foreseen the ways in which a single invention, the chip  , would transform our world thanks to its applications in personal computers, digital communications and factory robots. Tomorrow's achievements in biotechnology, artificial intelligence or even some still unimagined technology could produce a similar wave of dramatic changes. But one thing is certain: information and knowledge will become even more important, and the people who possess it, whether they work in manufacturing   or services, will have the advantage and produce the wealth. Computer knowledge will become as basic a requirement as the ability to read and write.

Within the next ten years, the U. S., China, Israel, and a crowd of private companies plan to set up camp on the moon. So if and when they plant a flag, does _ give them property rights? A NASA working group hosted a discussion this week to ask: Who owns the moon? The answer, of course, is no use. The Outer Space Treaty, the international signed by more than 100 countries, states that the moon and other celestial bodies   are the province of all mankind. No doubt that would annoy all of the people throughout the ages, like monks from the Middle Ages, who have tried to claim the moon was theirs. But ownership is different from property rights. People who rent apartments, for example, don't own where they live, but they still hold rights. So with all of the upcoming missions   to visit the moon and beyond, space industry thought leaders are seriously asking themselves how to deal with a potential land rush. \" This is a very relevant discussion right now. We've got this wave of new lunar missions from around the world,\" said William Marshall, a scientist in the small-spacecraft office at NASA, but who spoke this week at an event hosted by NASA's Co Lab, a collaborative  public-private working group. He was speaking from his personal interest and not on behalf of the agency. To be sure, the United States aims to send astronauts back to the moon by as early as 2015, in a mission that would include a long-term settlement.

Do you get upset when you have to wait for anything? If you have answered \"yes\" to most of these questions, then I can make a few predictions about you, based on a recent eight-year study of nearly two thousand people who live the way that you do. You likely find that life is full of challenges and you often need to keep two or more projects moving at the same time. The chances are that you have been to college, that you have a management job and that you bring work home at night. You think that you put more effort into your job than many of the people you work with, and you certainly take your work more seriously than most of them. You get angry easily, and if someone is being long-winded, you help them get to the point. You also have trouble finding the time to get your hair cut. And there's one other thing. You are about twice as likely to have a heart attack as someone who takes a more easygoing approach to life.  The beginnings of your hard-driving behavior go right back to childhood. In school you got recognition and perhaps prizes for being quick and bright, for being an achiever, for competing with others and for winning. You likely went on from school to get a series of increasingly better jobs against pretty stiff competition. They were jobs where you had to care about the results, where you constantly had to push things forward and get things done.

Whatever your hands touch, your phones touch. It has been discovered that some phones have 18 times more bacteria and viruses than any surface in a public restroom. So it probably won't surprise you that a 2011 University of London study found that one in six of our phones have bacteria and viruses on them--specifically, the bacteria called E. coli. The research on bacteria and viruses led to the invention of Phone Soap. It is not actually liquid like dishwasher soap. It is a phone charger that uses the electromagnetic radiation   used in hospitals to kill 99.9 percent of bacteria and viruses, cleaning your phone while it charges. \"There are really certain types of bacteria and viruses that we should not be in touch with, and they are really on our phones,\" says Wes Barnes, the Phone Soap co-founder. It all started while his cousin and co-founder, Dan LaPorte, was in his cancer research lab at college. \"He realized he got the idea of getting rid of bacteria and viruses on the phones,\" said Barnes. \"In the lab they used UV-C light for destroying them. He realized this would be the fastest, most powerful way to kill any bacteria and viruses living on electronic machines.\" Phone Soap looks like a little metal suitcase. Your phone rests in to charge and get cleaned at the same time. Instead of plugging your phone into the wall, you'd plug it into the Phone Soap charger box. The process only takes a few minutes but, Barnes says, \"The idea is that you can leave it in there overnight if you want to keep charging. Reflective paint keeps the light completely around the phone so it cleans the phone fully.\" The co-founders spent 2013 finding the right companies and they started shipping the product in late November. By last week's International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Phone Soap was all grown-up.

Though Goo Goo Clusters may not be as familiar as Kit Kat or Hershey bars, people of all ages have enjoyed it for an entire century. In 1901, a 19-year-old named Howell Campbell opened a candy store in Nashville, Tennessee. He made all kinds of sweets and hard candies with just two copper kettles and about a dozen employees. Then, in 1912, he made the first candy to combine chocolate with other ingredients such as caramel, marshmallow, nougat, and peanuts. Originally, these clusters were hand-wrapped and sold under the counter at a few local stores with a sign reading,\"A nourishing   lunch for a nickel.\" Now, they are known as Goo Goo Clusters.  What else makes a Goo Goo so special?\"In addition to it being the very first-ever combination confection created, its shape also makes it quite unique,'' says Beth Sachan, Goo Goo Clusters' senior marketing manager.\"The Goo Goo Cluster is a big, imperfectly round mound   of deliciousness!\" The 100th anniversary of the Goo Goo Cluster is being celebrated throughout the month of October, the biggest candy-selling month of the year. About 40 restaurants in the Nashville area have created unique desserts inspired by Goo Goo Clusters to serve to their customers. Additionally, a Goo Goo-sponsored race called the \"Jog'n Hog\" was held in Nashville on October 13. Adults and children ran three miles to the finish line after eating at least one of six Goo Goo Clusters from a bag they were given at the halfway point.

Other sources include parking fees, food and drink sales and souvenirs. Practically all amusement parks operate using one of two admission principles:         Pay-as-you-go In this form, a guest enters the park at little or no charge. The guest must then buy rides one by one, either at the attraction's entrance or by buying ride tickets. The cost of the attraction is often based on its complexity   or popularity. The park may allow guests to buy unlimited admissions to all attractions within the park. A pass is then shown at the attraction entrance to gain admission.        Disneyland opened in 1955 using the pay-as-you-go form. Initially, guests paid the ride admission fees at the attractions. Soon, the problems of dealing with so many coins led to the development of a ticket system that, while now out of use, is still part of the amusement-park vocabulary. In this new form, guests bought ticket books that contained a number of tickets, with \"A,\" \"B\" and \"C.\" Rides and attractions using an \"A-ticket\" were generally simple, with \"B-tickets\" and \"C-tickets\" used for the larger, more popular rides. Later, the \"D-ticket\" was added, then finally the now-famous \"E-ticket,\" which was used for the biggest rides, like Space Mountain. Smaller tickets could be traded up for use on larger rides. Disneyland, as well as the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World, gave up this practice in 1982.        The advantages include:        guests pay for only what they choose to experience         attraction costs can be changed easily         The disadvantages include:        guests may get tired of spending money almost continuously         guests may not spend as much on food or souvenirs \n Question: What is the passage mainly about? \n Options: (A) Attractions of amusement parks .

This is the research finding of a team of Japanese doctors, who say that most of our brains are not getting enough exercise, and as a result,we are ageing unnecessarily soon.  Professor Taijiu Matsuzawa wanted to find out why otherwise healthy farmers in northern prefix = st1 /Japanappeared to be losing their ability to think and reason at a  ly early age, and how the process of ageing could be slowed down. With a team of partners at Tokyo National University,he set about studying the brain volumes  of a thousand people of different ages and various jobs.  Computer technology enabled the researchers to get exact measurement of the volume  of the front and side sections of the brain,which relate to intellect and feelings,and determine the human character. The back section of the brain,which controls functions like eating or breathing,does not connect with age. One can continue living without intellectual or feeling abilities.  Contraction of front and side parts - as cells die off - was observed in some subjects in their thirties, but it was still not obvious in some sixty and seventy year olds.  Matsuzawa concluded from his tests that there is a simple cure for the contraction normally connected with age using the brain.  The findings show in general conditions that contraction of the brain begins soon among people in the country than in the town. Those are at least at risk,says Matsuzawa,who are lawyers,followed by university professors and doctors. White collar workers doing regular work in government offices are, however,as likely to have shrink   as the farm workers,bus drivers and shop assistants.

Unlike some environmental issues, rain forest depletion has fortunately received significant public and media attention. Despite the opposition to the cutting down of rain forests, the problem continues. Every year, Brazil chops down an area of forest the size of the state of Nebraska. In addition to the Amazon's rain forests, many other forests are being cut down as well. In Indonesia, Zaire, Papua-new Geinea, Malaysia, Burma, the Philippines, Peru, Colombia, Bolivia, and Venezuela, rain forests that were once great have been lost.

Most of the parts of your body still work great, you have a full head of hair, you're energetic, and you have a world of opportunity in front of you. However, there's going to come a time when you start to get older. And as you get older, you'll have new responsibilities, complete independence, and perhaps most importantly, less time to recover from mistakes. You see, we all make mistakes in life. Maybe you spent more money than you should have on a car, you passed up on a great job opportunity, or you didn't try as hard as you could have in school. It's a part of life and we learn from it. But there are certain mistakes that are much better made while you're still young and have plenty of time to recover. I'm definitely not telling you that you should purposely go out and make these mistakes (because they're a pain to recover from). But these are all mistakes that are much better made when you're younger so that you can learn from them and not have them ruin your entire life. Starting the wrong career Wouldn't you hate to be 45 years old and discover that you absolutely hate what you do for a living? It's a reality that a lot of people face and it can be difficult to fix. You see, when you're 23 and find out you don't like the career path you've chosen, you can easily explore new career options. We no longer live in an age when people are expected to stay with one company until they retire. You can bounce around a little bit and find out what you want to do. When you get older, just switching careers whenever you want isn't as simple. You have to consider your family, retirement, the difficulties you might run into with starting from the bottom in a new industry, and plenty of other issues that someone in their early 20's just doesn't have to deal with. Dating the wrong person The divorce rate in the U.S is extremely high. Other parts of the world aren't doing too much better either. While everyone gets divorced for their own reasons, I think we can all agree that it's better to find out that the person you're with is wrong for you sooner rather than later. Hopefully you find out whether or not the person you're with is right for you before you tie the knot, because around 50% of first marriages end in divorce. Messing up your credit Ruining your credit is never a good idea. Even if you ruin it while you're young, it could affect you in the future. The upside of having bad credit while you're young instead of older is that you have time to build it back up. It can take 7-10 years to rebuild your credit if you have a history of late payments, loan defaults, foreclosures, or bankruptcy. During those 7-10 years, you'll have a hard time financing anything unless you have a cosigner or put down a substantial down payment. Most people tend to make most of the bigger purchases in life when they get older such as a house or their dream car. If you have bad credit, you can kiss all of that goodbye. Making bad investments If you're investing money for your retirement, making bad decisions can mean you'll be working your entire life. Whether you choose to pay someone to do the investing for you or handle it all yourself, it's a lot better to take risks when you're younger. If you invest in stock or even real estate while you're young and the market takes a hit, you're not ruined. Investing is a long-term venture, so the younger you start, the more fluctuation you can withstand and still come out with a positive return. Blowing your money What would you do if you went broke at 60 years old? You would be working your behind off when you really should be relaxing and getting ready to retire soon. But if you're 25 and broke, you still have plenty of time to earn more money. Also, nobody will judge you because it's not unusual for people in their 20's to not have money these days. You might have blown your money on a nice car or have an obsession with all the newest gadgets. When you get older, you'll be able to look back and realize how dumb you were for spending $20,000 on a brand new car when you were only 20 years old. But when you're older and waste your money, you'll REALLY have nothing to show for it. \n Question: The following are all the advantages of being young EXCEPT   _  . \n Options: (A) you have more time to recover from mistakes (B) most of the parts of your body still work great (C) you have many responsibilities and complete independence (D) you have a world of opportunity in front of you", "output": "C", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

Because clutter in your outer environment is the physical sign of all the clutter going on inside of you. \" Clearing clutter has a chain effect across your entire life, including your work. Having an untidy desk covered in clutter could be stopping you achieving the business success you want. \" She is sure cleaning up will be helpful even though some of history's biggest achievers lived and worked in messy conditions. Churchill was considered untidy from a boy throughout his life, from his office to his artist's studio,and the lab where Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin was famously untidy. Among the recommendations is that simply tidying a desk at work and an overflowing filing cabinet  will instantly have a positive impact on \"your inner world. \" Anything that is no longer used should not be put into storage but thrown away completely. Keeping something in the loft, garage or other part of the house, does not help because it is still connected to the person \"by tiny energetic li.nes\", Ms Morris. claims. She said, \"The things in your life that are useful to you, that add value to your life, that serve a current purpose are charged with positive energy that refreshes you and enriches your life. But the things that you don't ever use and don't need anymore have the opposite effect on your energy. Things that no longer fit or serve you, use up your energy. \" \n Question: Which of the following statements does Ms Morris agree to? \n Options: (A) Changing the position of staff frequently will help to build up a clear mind.

Of course ,modern postal services now are much more developed and faster ,depending as they do on cars and planes for delivery .Yet they are still too slow for some people to send urgent documents and letters.        The invention of the fax machine increased the speed of delivering documents even more .When you send a fax ,you are sending a copy of a piece of correspondence to someone by telephone service .It was not until the early 1980s that such a service was developed enough for businesses to be able to fax documents to each other.        The fax service is still very much in use when copies of documents require to be sent ,but ,as a way of fast correspondence, it has been largely taken the place of by email. Email is used to describe messages sent from one computer user to another.        There are advantages and disadvantages with emails. If you send someone and email, then he will receive it extremely quickly. Normal postal services are rather slow as far as speed of delivery is concerned.

The survey work is part of a project to accurately record the exact dimensions  of 500 of the most famous World Heritage Sites, including the Acropolis in Athens and the Great Wall of China.    The joint team, from the Glasgow School of Art and Historic Scotland, are currently surveying 10 World Heritage Sites in Britain before they aim their laser beams at Mount Rushmore in South Dakota. There they will team up with members of the CyArk Foundation, a non-profit organization that has identified several \"at risk\" World heritage Sites. Mount Rushmore is on their list because of concerns over deterioration of the faces of four former presidents on the sculpture.    Laser scanning itself is not new but applying the technology to historic sites or buildings is a new approach. \"At first, these laser scanners were produced for things like refineries where there are lots of pipes and things or atmosphere that are different for humans to actually tolerate,\" Chris McGregor of Historic Scotland told Reuters Television. \"They hadn't really thought about the built heritage as being a market for such a machine but its use and the work that we are doing with it is really innovative and really exciting.    CyArk's goal is to create a huge database of detailed surveys of sites so that they can be maintained or even rebuilt if they should be damaged by a natural disaster, climate change or even war. They cited as an example the Buddhas or Bamiyan in Afghanistan, two monumental statues of standing Buddhas carved into the side of a cliffduring the sixth century that were destroyed by the Taliban in 2001. Despite offers from the governments of Japan and Switzerland, among others, to help rebuild the Buddhas, the team believe an accurate laser survey would have made the task more achievable.    Doug Pritchard from the Glasgow School of Art's Digital Design Studio said, \"We are discovering new things about the buildings which are hundreds, thousands of years old,\" he said.    CyaArk said the loss of architectural and archaeological cultural heritage is becoming a crisis of global proportions with an urgent need for reliable documentation as a key step to help preserve heritage sites. The development of laser scanning technology has given a greater accuracy to surveys and thrown new light on ancient monuments. \n Question: How does Chris think applying laser scanning to famous World Heritage Sites? \n Options: (A) Puzzling.

Up until the junior year I did not realize my capabilities   as a student. Being in the IB Program, I was told that my junior year would be the toughest in all the years of high school. With this \"little\" piece of information, I walked into my junior year, scared of my grades. As weeks went by, I started to believe that the junior year was not as hard as everyone had said, but I was wrong. My grades were rapidly declining  and by the end of the first term I had had five Cs in seven of my classes! I could not believe it --- I did not want to believe it. I tried my best to get my grades up myself without any help from anyone, but my pride just made my grades worse. And I had to miss out on one of the most important speech and debate competitions all year: States. I was heartbroken. I realized that I could not survive my junior year on my own, so I had to get help fast. Once I got a tutor, my grades went from Cs, Ds, and even some Fs, to nothing but As and Bs. I slowly started to gain my confidence back in all of my classes and even myself. By the time the third and fourth quarter came around, I had been on the honor roll twice, and I was receiving awards from speeches and debates, tennis and school.

We lie more to strangers than we lie to coworkers. Men lie eight times more about themselves than they do other people. Women lie more to protect other people.

His family immigrated to the United States in 1913, after a 12-day voyage. Mark moved to New York in the autumn of 1923 and found employment in the garment trade and settled down on the Upper West Side. It was while he was visiting someone at the Art Students League that he saw students painting a model. According to him, this was the start of his life as an artist. He was twenty years old and had taken some art lessons at school, so his initial experience was far from an immediate calling. In 1936, Mark Rothko began writing a book, which he never completed, about the similarities in the children's art and the work of modern painters. The work of modernists, which was influenced by primitive art, could, according to him, be compared to that of children in that \"Child art transforms itself into primitivism, which is only the child producing a copy of himself.\" In this same work, he said that \"The fact that one usually begins with drawing is already academic. We start with colour.\" It was not long before his multiform developed into the style he is remembered for. In 1949 Rothko exhibited these new works at the Betty Parsons Gallery. For reviewer Harold Rosenberg, the paintings were unique and primitive. Rothko had, after painting his first multiform, separated himself from the world in East Hampton on Long Island, only inviting a very few people, including Rosenberg, to view the new paintings. The discovery of his works' specialty came at a period of great sorrow: his mother Kate died in October 1948. As part of this new uniformity of artistic vision, his paintings no longer had individual titles. From this point on they were simply untitled, numbered or dated. However, to assist in distinguishing one work from another, traders would sometimes add the primary colours to the name. Additionally, for the next few years, Rothko painted in oil only on large vertical tents. This was done to surround the viewer, or, in his words, to make the viewer feel enveloped within the picture. \n Question: What did Rothko think of modern art? \n Options: (A) It could be produced by children.

Chinese literature has alyeady attracted international attention, but experts say translation remains a barrier. \"Many very good Chinese writers have been accepted globally for a long time already.\"says Michel Hockx, professor of University of London. \" It's mainly because there are many more opportunities for Chinese writers to visit other countries, to publish their work outside China and to interact with readerships abroad. At the same time, more and more people globally are learning Chinese and taking an interest in Chinese language and Chinese culture.\" Hockx adds: \"We need more good translators, especially foreign translators, who know good Chinese and can translate the work into their own languages in a way that foreign readers will appreciate and understand.\" London's independent literary agent Toby Eady, who represents many Chinese writers, including Yu Dan, met Mo about 15 years ago in China.

In the middle of the seventh inning fans ritualistically stand and stretch before the home team comes to bat.  No one really knows the origin of the custom, but there are theories on how it started. Baseball historian Dan Daniel provided this explanation: \"It probably began as an expression of fatigue. That would explain why the stretch comes late in the game instead of at the halfway point.\" A more popular story involves President William Howard Taft and the birth of two baseball traditions. According to the account, Taft attended the first game of the 1910 baseball season. On the spur of the moment, plate umpire  Billy Evans gave Taft the ball. He asked him to throw it over the plate. Taft did so, and the custom of having the president launch the baseball season with the first pitch was born.  The story continues that later that same day, President Taft, who weighed well over 300 pounds, became uncomfortable in his small chair. In the middle of the seventh inning, he stood up to stretch his legs. The crowd thought that the president was leaving, so they stood up out of respect. A few moments later, Taft sat down again. The fans followed, and the seventh-inning stretch was born. What a day for traditions! No matter how the tradition began, fans have since added to the fun. Now, as they stand to stretch during the seventh inning, they can sing along to Jack Norworth's 1927 version of the song \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" after the visiting team has batted. \n Question: The seventh-inning stretch is celebrated with the song \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\"   _  . \n Options: (A) a few moments after the beginning (B) after the visiting team has batted in the seventh inning (C) between the sixth and seventh innings (D) after the home team has batted in the seventh inning", "output": "B", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

According to the study,global warming ranks among the most serious threats to the planet's biodiversity and,under some conditions,may be more than that due to deforestation.This study provides even stronger scientific evidence that global warming will result in catastrophic species losses across the planet.Last month,a UN study said humans were responsible for the worst extinction and urged extra efforts to reach a UN target of slowing the rate of losses by 2010. Scientists disagree about how far global warming is to blame compared with other human threats such as deforestation,pollution and the introduction of some species to new habitats.But the new study looks at the 25 \"hot spots\"--areas that contain a big concentration of plants and animals--and predicts that 11.6 percent of all species,with a range from 1 to 43 percent,could be driven to extinction if levels of heat trapping gases in the atmosphere were to keep rising in the next 100 years. The range would mean the loss of thousands of species.The study gave a wide range because of uncertainties, for instance, about the ability of animals or plants to move towards the poles if the climate warmed.

This is just a language summer camp run by the primary school Bilingual Buds, which offers a year-round course in Chinese as well as Spanish for kids as young as 2. A lot of research now shows the regular, high-level use of more than one language may actually improve early brain development. Knowing two or more languages can improve the ability to focus, decide and deal with information better. These important skills are grouped together, known in brain terms as \"executive function\". The research suggests _ develop ahead of time in bilingual children, and are already evident in kids as young as 3 or 4. Bilingual education, common in many countries, is a growing trend across the United States, with 440 elementary schools offering the study in Spanish, Chinese and French. But Tamar Gollan, a professor at the University of California, has found a vocabulary gap between children who speak only one language and those who grow up with more. On average, the more language spoken, the smaller the vocabulary in each one. Gollan's research suggests that while that gap narrows as children grow, it does not disappear completely. Gollan says, \"Vocabulary tests help us find that bilinguals have the disadvantage, where you know the word but you just can't get it out.\" In fact some of the values of bilingualism can't be measured at all, of course. To speak more than one language is to open the mind to more than one culture or way of life. Bilinguals also appear to be better at learning other new languages.

Some spores are so small and light that they can float in the air. We may say that spores are quite the same as seeds. When these spores are all on wet and shady places, they usually grow into new plants. \n Question: Plants can make food from  _  . \n Options: (A) flower, water and air (B) water, sunlight and air (C) air, water and soil (D) air, sun and light", "output": "B", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

Dr. Stephen Spiro, a professor of the British Lung Foundation, said the further the particles travel, the less dangerous they will be. \"The cloud has already passed over northern Scotland and we haven't heard of any ill effects there,\" he said.

I was born and raised in America, and this was Miami, where I live, but they weren't quite ready to let me in yet. \"Please wait in here, Ms. Abujaber,\" the immigration officer said. My husband, with his very American last name, accompanied me. He was getting used to this. The same thing had happened recently in Canada when I'd flown to Montreal to speak at a book event. That time they held me for 45 minutes. Today we were returning from a literary festival in Jamaica, and I was shocked that I was being sent \"in back\" once again. The officer behind the counter called me up and said, \"Miss, your name looks like the name of someone who's on our wanted list. We're going to have to check you out with Washington.\" \"How long will it take?\" \"Hard to say...a few minutes,\" he said, \"We'll call you when we're ready for you.\" After an hour, Washington still hadn't decided anything about me. \"Isn't this computerized?\" I asked at the counter, \"Can't you just look me up?\" \"Just a few more minutes,\" they assured me. After an hour and a half, I pulled my cell phone out to call the friends I was supposed to meet that evening. An officer rushed over. \"No phones!\" he said, \"For all we know you could be calling a terrorist cell and giving them information.\" \"I'm just a university professor,\" I said. My voice came out in a squeak. \"Of course you are. And we take people like you out of here in leg irons every day.\" I put my phone away. My husband and I were getting hungry and tired. Whole families had been brought into the waiting room, and the place was packed with excitable children, exhausted parents, and even a flight attendant. I wanted to scream, to jump on a chair and shout: \"I'm an American citizen; a novelist; I probably teach English literature to your children.\" After two hours in detention  , I was approached by one of the officers. \"You're free to go,\" he said. No explanation or apologies. For a moment, neither of us moved. We were still in shock. Then we leaped to our feet. \"Oh, one more thing,\" he handed me a tattered photocopy with an address on it, \"If you aren't happy with your treatment, you can write to this agency.\" \"Will they respond?\" I asked. \"I don't know--I don't know of anyone who's ever written to them before.\" Then he added,\" By the way, this will probably keep happening each time you travel internationally.\" \"What can I do to keep it from happening again?\" He smiled the empty smile we'd seen all day, \"Absolutely nothing.\" After telling several friends about our ordeal, probably the most frequent advice I've heard in response is to change my name. Twenty years ago, my own graduate school writing professor advised me to write under a pen name so that publishers wouldn't stick me in what he called \"the ethnic ghetto\"--a separate, secondary shelf in the bookstore. But a name is an integral part of anyone's personal and professional identity--just like the town you're born in and the place where you're raised.

Far from the traditional image of a culture of aggressive masculinity ,the absence of girls gives boys the chance to develop without pressure to be consistent to a stereotype ,a US study says. Boys at single-sex schools were said to be more likely to get involved in cultural and artistic activities that helped develop their abilities to express their emotions,rather than feeling they had to obey to the\"boy code\"of hiding their emotions to be a\"real man\". The findings of the study are against the received wisdom that boys do better when taught alongside girls. Tony Little,headmaster of Eton,warned that boys were being ignored by the British education system because it had become too focused on girls.He criticized teachers for failing to recognize that boys are actually more emotional than girls. The research argued that boys often perform badly in mixed schools because they become discouraged when their female peers do better earlier in speaking and reading skills. But in single-sex schools teachers can adjust lessons to boys'learning style,letting them move around the classroom and getting them to compete in teams to prevent boredom,wrote the study's author, Abigail James of the University of Virginia. Teachers could encourage boys to enjoy reading and writing with \"boy-focused\" approaches such as themes and characters that appeal to them.Because boys generally have sharper vision,learn best through touch, and are physically more active,they need to be given\"hands-on\"lessons where they are allowed to walk around.\"Boys in mixed schools view classical music as feminine and prefer the modem type in which violence and sexism are major themes,\"James wrote. Single-sex education also made it less likely that boys would feel they had to give in to a stereotype that men should be\"masterful and in charge\"in relationships.\"In mixed schools boys feel pressed to act like men before they understand themselves well enough to know what that means,\"the study reported. \n Question: The author believes that a single-sex school would  _  . \n Options: (A) force boys to hide their emotions to be\"real men\" (B) help to form masculine aggressiveness in boys (C) encourage boys to express their emotions more freely (D) naturally place emphasis on the traditional image of a man to boys", "output": "C", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

Terrifying but also attractive, they are as popular in the early 21st century as ever, as the current popularity of Twilight series, and its hero Edward Cullen, show. Vampires first appeared in fiction in the 1700s; in 1895 Irish novelist Bram Stoker published Dracula, introducing the world's most famous vampire. But just what is it about these drinkers of human blood that continues to fascinate us? Speaking to Eric Lewis of the Times and Transcript website, academic Deborah Wells said that vampires are \"culturally adaptive \". \"We create very different vampires to fit different times. Edward Cullen is not the same as Count Dracula,\" she said. Different as they are, Wells believes vampires are \"the perfect containers into which we can pour our current cultural anxieties\". Bram Stoker's Dracula is powerful, yet old and physically ugly. Stoker's book dealt with fear of the fall of the British Empire, real fears in the day in which it was written. According to the website Bookpages, today's vampires have all our cultural desires, money, power and sexual attraction. Represented by Cullen, they are noble, handsome young men whom women find irresistible . What's more, vampires challenge traditional ideas about death, science and parental authority . This may be why teenagers are drawn to vampire tales. \"In many ways, the vampire story shows up teenage concerns,\" said Wells. \"The emotional intensity   of the relationship with the vampire matches the intensity of how it feels to have your first real love affairs. Your first real love, it really feels like life and death.\" \n Question: What is the vampire like in Bram Stoker's book? \n Options: (A) Anxious but perfect.

But they could not provide effective medical care to their patients without the help of numerous other medical employees. From the viewpoint of the patients, the nursing staff is particularly important. Nurses are usually in close contact with patients as long as they are in the hospital. A nurse does not study for as many years as a doctor. however, each must be equally dedicated. Caring for sick persons requires a great deal of patience and concern. Most nurses work long days, and they often must work at odd hours or during the night. Under the supervision   of the head nurse, the nursing staff must provide nursing services on a 24-hour basis and attend to patients' needs. This responsibility continues around the clock, and so nurses must work in shifts. A shift is a period of duty, usually eight in length. The nurses on the ward rotate their shifts. Some take turns working night duty; others work odd shifts. A nurse must always be alert. She can never afford to be careless. This is true in all nursing situation, but it is especially true in the intensive care unit. Patients under intensive care are critically ill, and they must be monitored at all times. The nurses who do intensive care duty have one of the most demanding jobs in the hospital. Serving as a nurse can be a very rewarding job. But it is not an easy one.

It might be because we are stuck in a traffic jam or stuck behind a very slow driver. It might be because we think another driver has done something very stupid and dangerous. Whatever the reason, it seems that getting angry in a car is something which happens more and more often and there is now a special term for it \"road rage\". Some experts even think that road rage is a kind of mental illness! How can we recognize this \"illness\" of road rage? There are two kinds of road rage: aggressive driving and aggressive reactions to the way other people are driving. Aggressive driving can take different forms: *Driving much faster than the speed limit. *Increasing your speed very quickly. *Driving very close behind the car in front and sounding the horn or flashing the headlights. *Changing lanes very suddenly and blocking another car. *Moving into a parking space where another car is trying to park. There are also different reactions to the way other people are driving. These include: *Making rude signs at people. *Shouting at people and threatening them. *Deliberately driving into another person's car. *Hitting somebody. *Using a weapon such as a baseball bat, or even a gun or a knife. Road rage is certainly not a joke. There have been incidents of road rage which have led to serious injuries and even murder. Experts think that one reason for road rage is that films show a lot of examples of fast and aggressive driving such as car chases where this kind of driving seems to be positive. Experts also think that the punishments for dangerous driving are not serious enough. Experience shows that driving problems can be controlled, but it takes a long time. In the UK in the last 30 years, the police have been quite successful in reducing the number of people who drink and drive. They are now working to stop people using mobile phones when they are driving. Let's hope they can have the same success with the road rage. \n Question: Which of the following statements does NOT describe aggressive     driving? \n Options: (A) Driving much faster than the speed limit.

Most would think a man invented these items. Guess what? Women invented each of these. What? You don't believe me? Well, read this: Liquid Paper was invented by Bette Nesmith Graham in 1951 and originally called Mistake Out. Being a typist, Bette was increasingly _ with being unable to erase her typing mistakes. The messy business left her hands black and the paper dirty. Bette was good at painting and remembered that an artist paints over mistakes. She applied that same principle to typing mistakes and Liquid Paper was born, making Bette into a self-made millionaire. Kevlar, yes, the Kevlar of the bullet proof vest --what police officers and soldiers wear, was invented by Stephanie Kwolek. Stephanie worked for the DuPont Company as a research chemist. She was asked to find a high-performance fiber. Originally, this fiber was intended to be used for car tires  . However, the fiber she developed in 1964 was amazing and is still used in products such as sailboats, skis, shoes, and yes, bullet proof vests. In 1995 Stephanie was named to the National Inventor's Hall of Fame. Margaret Knight invented a machine that revolutionized the making of paper bags. Paper bags had been made like envelopes but Margaret developed a machine that would fold and paste a flat-bottom paper bag, the very same type we still use today. Margaret's family was poor and she started working at the age of nine. Her first invention at the age of twelve was a safety tool for a loom . Later she worked for the Columbia Paper Bag Company. It was there that she worked on improving the making of paper bags. She was issued her patent in 1870. So next time you use a new product or an old one, will you wonder who made it? Do some research on the web and answer a few questions like: Who invented it? How was it invented? You may be surprised at some of the stories you uncover. \n Question: What do we know about Margaret? \n Options: (A) She was a member of the National Inventor's Hall of Fame.

Andrews, first taste of success came at the age of 10. She won a talent competition in her home town of Huntingdon, Tennessee, singing I Will Always Love You, originally sung by Whitney Houston. Houston's version of the song appeared on The Bodyguard sound track, which happened to be the first album Andrews ever bought. Within two years, talk of Andrews had spread to Nashville and caught the attention of producer Byron Gallimore, whose credits include work with Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, and Jo Dee Messina. With Gallimore signed on to produce, Andrews soon had a recording contract  with Dream Works' Nashville label. Andrews' professional career was launched with 1999's Heart Shaped World, recorded when she was 14 years old. The album included the country hit I Will Be There For You, which also appeared on The Prince Of Egypt . She followed up the release of the album by touring as a support act for such country superstars as Faith Hill and Trisha Yearwood. With the release of 2001's, Who I Am, Andrews became a star in her own right. The album was certified  gold for sales of 500,000 copies. Andrews returned in April 2003 with Now,an album that she promised would show a new side of the young artist. \"This album has a very different feeling for me,\" she said. \"It's a lot more personal and there's a confidence that wasn't quite there on the first two.

The camera is often thought to be a modern invention. But as early as 1727, a German physicist discovered that light darkened silver salt, a chemical compound. Using as a camera, a big box with a small hole to let the light in, he made temporary images on the salt. Silver salt is still the base of film today. Then a French scientist made the first permanent picture by using a special piece of metal sensitized(...)with silver salt. A photograph he made in 1826 still exists. The painter Daguerre improved on the process by placing common salt, the kind we eat, on the metal. This was in 1839, the official date of the beginning of photography. But the problem was the printing of the photographs. And it was not until other scientists developed the kind of paper we now use that good printing was possible and photography became truly common. In the 1860s, Mathew Brady was able to take his famous pictures of the American Civil War, thus making portrait poses very popular. In the 20thcentury, George Eastmen of theprefix = st1 /United Statessimplified film-developing film, and Dr. Edwin Land invented the so-called instant camera with self-developing film.

The students, after consulting social statistics, talking to the boys and working out data, concluded that 90 percent of the boys would spend some time in prison.  Twenty-five years later another group of graduate students was given the job of testing the prediction. They went back to the same area. Some of the boys--by then men--were still there.

But, as we can't drink seawater, how can it be important? Every part of our seas and oceans contains an amazing number of animals and fish that live at different ocean depths. Most of the different species of animals and fish depend on simple plants for their food. These simple plants called algae   drift near the surface of the ocean and use sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water into food and oxygen. In fact, algae produce over half of the oxygen people breathe. How important seawater is! Each plant or animal in our seas and oceans is an important link in a food chain. The algae are eaten in large amounts by microscopic animals, which are in turn consumed by larger animals. These food chains are delicately balanced. The bad news about the food chains in the oceans is that they are under threat because of man. People once thought that the oceans were so big that it didn't matter if we dumped rubbish into them or caught huge quantities of fish and whales for food. But we now know this is not true and fish stocks in the oceans have started to drop. Thankfully, the world is taking steps to protect the future of our oceans by introducing international agreements to protect marine habitats. Most countries have introduced fishing restrictions to protect fish stocks in the oceans and new techniques are being pioneered to cope with pollution. Finally, the importance of protecting oceans is being made known to more people. This is just the beginning of a long process to protect the oceans for our future.

So she let out a yell, caught hold of her 2-year-old daughter Kibibi and climbed up into a tree. She lives at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. And on Tuesday, August 23rd, witnesses say she seemed to sense the big earthquake that shook much of the East Coast before any humans knew what was going on. And she's not the only one. In the moments before the quake, an orangutan   let out a loud call and then climbed to the top of her shelter. \"It's very different from their normal call,\" said Brandie Smith, the zookeeper. \"The lemurs (monkey-like animals of Madagascar) will sound an alarm call if they see or hear something highly unusual.\" But you can't see or hear an earthquake 15 minutes before it happens, can you? Maybe you can -- if you're an animal. \"Animals can hear above and below our range of hearing,\" said Brandie Smith. \"That's part of their special abilities.

And a huge lizard   ran quickly for _ . The flamingoes (a kind of bird) gathered before the quake and stayed together until the shaking stopped.

Scientist Susan Hough says earthquakes produce two types of waves -- a weak \"P\" wave and then a much stronger \"S\" wave. The \"P\" stands for \"primary\". And the \"S\" stands for \"secondary\". She said she thinks the \"P\" wave might be what set the animals off. Not all the animals behaved unusually before the quake.

Rowling set children's imaginations on fire. Can the creator of Harry Potter do the same for a grown-up audience? The British author will find out on September 27, when more than 2 million hardcover  copies of her first novel for adults hit bookstores in the UK and the US, along with the digital edition. Set in a little English town, The Casual Vacancy is about an election held after an unexpected death. Michael Pietsch, Rowling's US publisher, says the novel reminded him of Dickens \"because of the humanity, the humor, the social concerns, the intensely real characters\". No magic though, apparently: \"This book isn't Harry Potter\", says Pietsch. \"It is a completely different concern\". As with Harry Potter, there are no advance copies for the media, no early reviews. To date, the seven-book series has sold more than 450 million copies worldwide, and it became one of the most successful movie franchises in July 21, 2007. Back then, fans could buy books at midnight parties hosted by bookstores. But recent years have seen a great challenge for brick-and-mortar  bookstores. People are still buying books, indeed more books than in 2007, according to figures released by the Association of American Publishers. But they are reading them in a new format --the e-book. The Harry Potter series just became available digitally for the first time in April. It will be different for The Casual Vacancy, with the publisher _ releasing an e-book. For Rowling fans who once queued up for Harry Potter, this means that instant satisfaction is now only a click away. Moving from children's books to adult literature is a big transition. Will Rowling's new book be successful? Arthur Levine, the US co-editor of the Harry Potter books, seems confident: \"If you read or re-read the Harry Potter books, you can see that Rowling has all the strengths she needs for great success as a fiction writer -you have great characters, an involving plot, a sense of humor and great empathy\". \n Question: What do the Harry Potter series and The Casual Vacancy have in common? \n Options: (A) They are both intended for children.

Schools spokesman Michael Gove declared plans yesterday to give disadvantaged children more classroom time to help them catch up. Longer school days could also be popular with parents who struggle to fit 3pm school finishing times around work, he said.  Mr. Gove gave out the success of a U.S. plan where teenagers from poor backgrounds attend school from 7.30 am to 5pm. \"I believe that having children in school for longer, particularly if they come from disadvantaged backgrounds can help them to achieve more in academy, \" he told the annual conference of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers in Manchester. He pointed out that it was up to schools alone to decide whether to open longer, or at weekends. But he was greeted with laughter from delegates  when he said the plan would really work only with the active support of teachers.  ATL general secretary, Dr Mary Bousted, said, \"The last thing we need to be doing at the present time is increasing teachers' working hours. Teachers already work the most unpaid overtime of any public sector profession. If we want Saturday schools then we need more teachers doing the extra hours, not the same teachers working longer and becoming tired.\" Meanwhile Mr Gove's idea is likely to alarm those concerned about the erosion( )of family time.

A survey of British parents showed the aspirations   of their children are greatly different from what they dreamed about when considering who they wanted to be when they grew up. Although astronaut   still remains fairly high on the list of careers   kids dream about these days, others like doctor and teacher have been taken the place of by the desire   to win good name and money as a sporting hero, pop star or actor. The parents of children aged 5 to 11 said the choice of lawyer had dropped by only one place on a top 10 list to sixth, while teacher had dropped to ninth from top in the last 25 or more years. The survey for British TV channel \"Watch\" found a great difference between the genders   of today's young people when compared with their parents' dreams 25 years or more ago. Playing professional football, being an astronaut and joining the firefighting service topped the boys' choices, while girls are more likely to be dreaming of taking to the stage as a pop star or actress or joining the medical profession. When asked what they would like their children to do for a living, today's parents still like the academic   professions  , with law and medicine scoring highly, while being a boss came third. Parents also praised job happiness above wealth   when it comes to their hopes for their children.

The Romans designed a special day to show admiration and respect to the moon. They called it \"Moonday\", or \"Monday\", as we know it today. Later, the great mind of Leonardo da Vinci studied the moon and designed a machine to carry a human to the moon. Leonardo said that one day a great machine bird would take a person to the moon and bring great honour to the home where it was born. Four and a half centuries later, Leonardo's idea was realized. Apollo II took three Americans--Collins, Aldrin, and Armstrong--to the moon. The mission   did fill the whole world with great surprise, as Leonardo had said it would. A lot of essays, articles, and books were written about man's first moon mission. But perhaps the most interesting story was one written before the event----over 100 years before.  In 1865, French author Jules Verne wrote a story about the first journey to the moon. His story was very similar to the 1969 Apollo II mission.  Verne's spacecraft also contained three men--two Americans and a Frenchman. The spacecraft was described as being almost the same size as Apollo II. The launch site in Verne's story was also in prefix = st1 /Florida. The spacecraft in Verne's story was named the \"Columbiad\". The Apollo II command ship was called \"Columbia\". His account of sending the spacecraft into the space could easily have been written about how Apollo II was sent into the space. Verne's story was the same as the actual event in several other respects. The speed of Verne's spacecraft was 36,000 feet per second; Apollo's was 35,533 feet per second. Verne's spacecraft took 97 hours to reach the moon; Apollo's time was 103 hours. Like Apollo's spacemen, Verne's spacemen took pictures of the moon's surface, relaxed on their seats, cooked with gas, and experienced weightlessness. They too came down in the Pacific and were picked up by an American warship.  What were the reasons for Jules Verne's extreme accuracy   in describing an event 100 years or more before it actually occurred? He based his writings on the law of physics and astronomy  . Nineteenth-century science and the vivid Verne's imagination gave people an unbelievably accurate preview of one of the greatest events of the 20thcentury. \n Question: Leonardo da Vinci said that a great machine bird would   _  . \n Options: (A) bring great honor to the moon (B) . fly toward the sun (C) explore the heavens (D) take people to the moon", "output": "D", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

Being aware of the potential in silk trade, Thompson returned to Thailand to start his own silk business upon his retirement in 1946. At that time, silk production was becoming weaker due to the slow collection process. To revive the business, in 1947, he took a variety of silk clothes back to New York City to see if the product would be marketable to foreign consumers. He received a positive response, so the Jim Thompson Silk Company was founded in 1948. After the establishment of his company, silk costumes soon appeared in Broadway plays and popular films such as Ben Hur, and Thai royalty, such as Her Majesty Queen Sirikit, began wearing silk often.Many also think his work contributed greatly to the Thai economy, since the silk industry continues to employ thousands of Thai citizens even today. Jim Thompson's success is no mystery.However, his disappearance on March 26, 1967 certainly is one.Thompson made a trip to Malaysia to visit friends and one day , ventured into the jungle   on an afternoon walk.He was never seen again despite search parties sent out by the Royal Army Air Corps and British troops.Many have their own theories on his disappearance, but none have been completely confirmed. \n Question: What does the author think of Thompson's disappearance?   _ \n Options: (A) Expected (B) Unbelievable (C) Alarming (D) Confusing", "output": "D", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

In 2010, more than 200 million people left their home countries to live in a new country. This is about 3 percent of the total world population. Some experts believe that number will swell to 400 million by 2050. Rates of immigration have remained strong for the last 300 years, but patterns of immigration have changed since World War II. The backgrounds and experiences of today's immigrants are different from those of the typical European immigrant of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Contemporary immigrants range from unskilled laborers to highly skilled professionals, and they come from and go to countries all over the world. In the nineteenth century and until World War II, immigration was primarily in one direction- from the Old World to the New World. This is no longer the case. Countries such as Russia and China, which have long been, and continue to be, significant source countries, are now also destination countries. There is also considerable mobility inside regions, such as from one European country to another, or among the countries of the former Soviet Union. In spite of such differences, the push and pull factors for immigration remain essentially the same as they were 100 years ago. Most people move to another country because they want a better life. For the majority of immigrants, this means better economic conditions. As in past generations, a labor shortage in one country often draws workers from another country, especially if wages are significantly higher. In some small countries, for example, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait, there are more jobs than citizens. The demand for labor is so high that the majority of the population consists of foreign-born workers, ranging from highly skilled engineers and financial experts to domestic and construction workers. In traditional destination countries, such as the United States, however, labor needs have changed. Today, although there is still demand for unskilled labor, there is increasing demand for people with a high level of skill and education. The need for less skilled labor has shifted to other countries. As work on farms and in industry in the United States and Canada once drew workers from all over the world, now work in factories in Taiwan and south Korea attracts workers from Vietnam, the Philippines, and Cambodia. Most global immigration is legal: however, a large number of people also move across national borders illegally in pursuit of employment. Experts estimate that about 15 to 20 percent of immigrants worldwide are in their new countries illegally. The United States has the largest number of these immigrants, followed by South Africa, with significant numbers also in Northern and Western Europe and Mexico. These immigrants face particular challenges because they often must hide from the authorities who might deport them back to their home countries. Their illegal status also means that employers may take advantage of them by forcing them to work longer hours and paying them less than the legal minimum wage. Although economics remains the most important motivation in all forms of immigrant, other factors are also important. Some people decide to leave their home countries because their actions or political beliefs make it dangerous for them to remain. Others choose to leave because their home country has become too dangerous and unstable, often because of war or political unrest. They wish to find a place that is secure for themselves and their families. Education is also a significant factor for many modern immigrants. They want to raise their children in a place where they can get a good education, which, in turn, they hope will provide them with better prospects for the future. Finally, family and community ties also play a role in immigration decisions. As in the past, once a group of people from one country establishes a community in a new country, more people from that country is likely to follow. The pattern, direction, and rate of immigration may change as the global economy changes. However, as long as life in a new country is more attractive than life in the old country, immigration will continue. \n Question: According to the reading, what are the patterns of immigration in China and Russia today? \n Options: (A) Many people leave these countries while many people also immigrate to them.

Chief technology officer Justin Rattner showed how personal devices will one day offer advice. \"How can we change the relationship so we think of these devices not as devices but as assistants or even companions?\" he asked. Handheld devices could combine already common geographic location technology with data from microphones, cameras, heart and body monitors and even brain scans to offer their owners advice that today only a friend or relative could give. \"Imagine a device that uses a variety of sensors to determine what you are doing at an instant, from being asleep in your bed to being out for a run with a friend, \" Rattner said, \"Future devices will constantly learn about who you are, how you live, work and play.'' Rattner also demonstrated a television remote control that figures out who is holding it based on how it is held, and then learns the viewer's entertainment preferences. As the world leader for decades in microchips for servers and desktop computers, Intel is hurrying to catch up in the profitable market for smart phones like Apple's iPhone and Research in Motion's Blackberry. Telephones with e-mail, global positioning and media players are pointing the way to a future where ever more functions are packed into ever smaller mobile devices. The smart phone industry, including technology giants like LG and Samsung, is likely to sell 270 million phones this year and grow 25 percent in 2011, according to market research company IDC. \"I think you can expect to see features that support context-aware computing starting to appear in Intel products in the near future,\" Rattner said. But analysts say Intel faces an uphill battle getting its microchips into new phones as Nvidia, Marvell and Qualcomm have already made headway with cheap, lower-power processors based on designs by ARM Holdings. Rattner recognized that questions about privacy and people's willingness to be intimate with their computers will have to be settled before the future generation of smart phones he described takes off. \"If you think identity threat is a problem today, imagine when your whole context is readily available on the Net.\", he said. \n Question: The future smart phones can do all of the following except   _  . \n Options: (A) giving responses to the moods of the owners (B) giving proposals like assistants or companions (C) offering advice to their owners' friends or relatives (D) telling the phone holders or carriers where they are", "output": "C", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

If you have been into technology enough, perhaps you may have a knowledge of the MP4. If not, you do need to know something before buying one, even if you are familiar with MP3. MP3 is the CD-like disc with greater capacity. How about MP4? This small digital product will really enrich the joy from listening to music. You can even feel the \"touch\" of music to your soul! Now, some similar digital products advertised as \"MP4 players\" are simply MP3 players, which do not play video and MPEG format   and also lack other particular functions. These products confuse some buyers, as they may think the \"MP4\" players simply mean they can do more than MP3. What is MP4?!  It is a multimedia container. It is not only used to store digital audio   and digital video streams, especially those of MPEG, but can also be used to store other data such as subtitles   and pictures. As a most modern container format, it allows streaming over the Internet.  With the help of a piece of MP4 video equipment, you can change various programs such as MPEG to MP4, ASX to MP4, AVI to MP4 and so on, which can be done very quickly and easily without any effect on the sound quality. By installing   DVD-MP4 software, you can transfer particular music from a DVD to an MP4 video file. It really excites your listening music experience.

Anti-wind campaigners are angry that areas including the forests made famous by the tales of the Brothers Grimm are among the targets for new turbines  . For the first time they have formed a national opposition group to _ the expansion. They say the expansion will damage forests and tourism across the country. Germany has started a massive expansion of renewable energy since the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 in Japan. The government decided to reduce atomic plants and instead increase the opportunities for green power. As a result, solar farms, biogas plants and wind parks are booming. In 2013, 22% of Germany's electricity was generated by renewable energy. Wind has played a major part in this change, making up half of the renewable energy in 2013, and the public has been generally supportive. To date, a majority of the 23,000 wind turbines in the country have been built in the flat northern and eastern parts of the country. But now the focus of expansion is on the areas of dark forest in the central and southern areas of Germany. One such region is the Rheinhardswald in the northern part of the state of Hesse. This is the home of the magical tales of Sleeping Beauty, Rapunzel and others, made famous in the books of the Brothers Grimm. This scenic place is a magnet, attracting hundreds and thousands of tourists from all over the world. But now there are also plans to build up to 200 turbines in this scenic place! Ann-Kathrin Blankenberg is a PhD student and an opponent of the plans. \"It is not because this is the area of Sleeping Beauty,\" she says, \"I want the green movement, I want green technology, I don't want nuclear power--- but they should be made in the right way and not by destroying the forests.\" The campaigners argue that putting wind turbines in this area makes no sense. The wind speeds are low and the area is home to some extremely rare birds including the endangered black stork.

Bags for women have become bigger and heavier as designers combine briefcases with handbags and straps have become longer, resulting in many users complaining of neck, shoulder and back problems. \"I see so many women with neck pains and headaches and what I usually do is look for their purse and pick it up,\"said Jane Sadler, a family practice physician at Baylor Medical Center in Garland, Texas.\"We take it over to the scale and weigh it and usually they're anywhere from 7 to 10 pounds.

As we rely too much on technology instead of our brains, many people have lost three basic abilities. The first skill many people have lost is remembering phone numbers. Because phone numbers are stored in smartphone contacts, there's now no need to dial a number or look at it again. _  And some people may also have lost their sense of direction because navigation apps can guide people anywhere they want. People get so dependent on them that when they can't use their smartphones, they get lost and anxious. But the worst lost skills may be social ones, meaning that some people are becoming socially inept People often bury themselves in their smartphones. As we're too absent-minded by what's happening in the virtual some of us have lost conversational skills and sometimes can't even distinguish whether a person is happy or not. Last August, researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, studied 51 students aged 11 and 12 who had over five hours' screen time every day. Their task was to tell the emotions of 48 pictures of faces that were happy, sad, angry or scared. The children made an average of 14. 02 mistakes at the  beginning.  But after a five-day camp without electronic products, they made only 9.41 mistakes on average. Luckily, people still have a chance to get these abilities back.  You should try to keep your parents' numbers in mind for emergencies. You should also pay more attention to street signs and stores , which will help you to draw a mind map and stop you from getting lost.

Jordan Romero, who last year at age 13 became the youngest person to climb the world's tallest peak Mt Everest, was descending to base camp on Sunday after reaching the summit of Vinson Massif with a team that included his father and stepmother, according to his team's website. \"We're at the roof of Antarctica,\" a member of Team Jordan said in a webcast from near the 4897-metre peak on a frigid but \"legendary day\".     Romero beat the record previously held by Britain's George Atkinson, who in May completed the seven ascents at the age of 16.

In September 2009 at age 13, he climbed Indonesia's Carstensz Pyramid, at 6194 meters the tallest island peak in the world, breaking another record.

With this chip, people can receive TV signals on their phones and watch programs without any time or space limitations.\"As long as the handset terminal  has a colored screen and a battery, our chip can turn it into a mobile TV,\" said Meng Fei, director of Innofidei's business development department.

He said that this, together with plans by China's state broadcaster, would ensure the 2008 Games lives up to its promise as a \"People's Olympics\". \"Our chips are cheap so that cell phones with them will not be much different in price from regular phones,\" Meng said. \"CCTV will offer some free channels during the Games, so people can enjoy the Olympics for free.\" SARFT  is planning to build a regional test network in Beijing and hopes to start trials as soon as possible.

High school was hard, because everyone wanted to have nice clothes, hang out, drive cars, and all these cost money. Peter's father was the sort of guy that believed you had to earn whatever you got, so he wasn't just about to hand over lots of money for Peter to use to have fun. So, he had to get a job. During his freshman year summer vacation, his classmate got him a job working on a hay   farm. He threw hay up into wagons as the tractor drove around fields, and then they stacked   it in the hot barn. It was a hot, lowpaying job. He once worked a few nights a week at a grocery store. He put things on the shelf. It was a lot of lifting and carrying, and his arms were strong from this and the previous job. It was dull and didn't pay much. He took some time off when soccer got serious, but the following summer he tried working at a lumber yard. It was hot outside, but he got a lot of exercise lifting and carrying things like boards and drywall. He also learned a lot about building supplies. It still didn't pay well. From there, he spent a year doing some tutoring for a friend of the family, but that was piecemeal. His first real job came the last year at school, when he fixed registers and worked on computers at a big box store. It was his favorite job yet, but it still didn't pay well. What Peter realized with all of these jobs was that he needed a better paying job! The only way to get that was to get trained or educated. He could go to school and get a 2year degree in an office or technical position. His other choices were going to a 4year college or joining the army. He wasn't sure what he was going to do yet, but he knew he had to do something. Jobs were a lot of work, money was hard to earn, but he liked staying busy and being able to buy things.

It won't hurt to leave the key in the truck this once, he thought, as he filled his gas tank at a self-service gas station. But minutes later, as he was paying the money, he saw the truck being driven away. In 2010, 1.6 million motor vehicles were stolen in the United States --one every 20 seconds. If present trends continue, experts predict vehicle thefts   could be over two million every year by the end of the decade. Vehicle theft is a common phenomenon, which has a direct effect on over four million people a year. The cost is astonishing. Many police officials blame professional thieves for the large number of the thefts. It is a major moneymaker for organized crime. Typically, stolen cars are taken to pieces and the parts sold to individuals. But as many as 200,000 cars are smuggled    out of  the country every year. Most go to Latin America, the Middle East and Europe. Only about 15 percent car thefts result in an arrest, because few police departments specially conduct in depth auto investigations. When thieves are arrested, judges will often sentence them to probation  , not immediately put them in prison because the prisons are overcrowded with violent criminals. One exception is a Michigan program that calls for 92 police officers to work full time on the state's 65,000 car theft cases a year. Since 2006, when the effort began, the state's auto theft rate has fallen from second in the nation to ninth. How can you protect your car? If you live in a high theft area or drive an expensive model, consider a safety system. It may cost anywhere from $ 25 to $ 1,000. Some systems work automatically - simply removing the key disables the fuel pump and the starter. When cars are equipped with such systems, thefts may drop by one third. In some states, you may be able to use a device that transmits radio signals, allowing stolen cars to be tracked by police. \n Question: What does the author think Joe Temper should be to blame for? \n Options: (A) He should have equipped his car with a security system.

We just mean that it's common for older people to become a little shorter over time. This kind of shrinking can't be reversed, although people can slow or stop this process. But why does shrinking happen at all? Because of gravity (the force that keeps your feet on the ground) , cushions between the bones in the spine  , get compressed  , which makes a person lose a little height and become shorter. Another reason why some older people shrink is because of osteoporosis  . Osteoporosis occurs when bone is broken down and not enough new bone material is made. Over time, bone is said to be lost because it's not being replaced. Bones become smaller and weaker and can easily break if someone with osteoporosis is injured. Older people--especially women, who generally have smaller and lighter bones to begin with--are more likely to develop osteoporosis. As years go by, a person with osteoporosis can get small breaks in bones that are called compression fractures . These breaks cause collapse of the spine and over time the person with osteoporosis can become hunched over  . Did you know that every day you shrink a little, too? You aren't as tall at the end of the day as you are at the beginning. That's because as the day goes on, water in the disks of the spine gets compressed due to gravity, making you just a tiny bit shorter. Don't worry, though.

Some experts claim the answer is to make jobs more varied. But do more various jobs lead to greater productivity? There is evidence to suggest that while variety certainly makes the worker's life more enjoyable, it does not actually make him work harder. As far as increasing productivity is concerned, then variety is not an important factor. Other experts feel that giving the worker freedom to do his job in his own way is important, and there is no doubt that this is true. The problem is that this kind of freedom cannot easily be given in the modern factory with its complicated machinery which must be used in a fixed way. Thus while freedom of choice may be important, there is usually very little that can be done to create it. Another very important consideration is how each worker contributes to the product he is making. In most factories the worker sees only one part of the product. Some car factories are now experimenting with having many small production lines rather than one large one, so that each worker contributes more to the production of the cars on his line. It would seem that not only is degree of the worker contribution an important factor, therefore, but it is also one we can do something about. To what extent does more money lead to greater productivity? The workers themselves certainly think this is important. But perhaps they want more money only because the work they do is boring. Money just lets them enjoy their spare time more. A similar argument may explain demands for shorter working hours. Perhaps if we succeed in making their jobs more interesting, they will neither want more money, nor will shorter working hours be so important to them. \n Question: Which of the following is the best way to make workers work harder according to the author? \n Options: (A) Increasing their pay.

This attractive career is for people who want a huge change of scenery and planet. The project is called the Hundred Years Starship, which aims to colonize   other lands such as the red planet Mars. Settlers would travel to the red planet and live there forever. NASA says it would be too expensive to bring humans back to Earth. The space agency can afford, however, to send supplies to the astronaut pioneers from Earth. Astronauts would be landed on the planet's surface and would never be able to return home due to the cost. NASA has started the project with $1.6 million, and hopes to attract investment from space-living billionaires. Google co-founder Larry Page told NASA he would be interested if the cost of a one-way ticket can go down from $10 billion to $2 billion. The journey to Mars could take 4 months. Setting on the red planet would be extremely dangerous, especially given the freezing temperatures there. The thin atmosphere would be another problem as it is mostly carbon dioxide, so oxygen supplies are a must. A director in NASA said that he believed the trip might start with visiting Mars's moons first. He claimed that humans could be on Mars's moons by 2030. Many scientists think colonizing space is absolutely necessary. Steven Hawking believes we must move to other planets to survive as a species. He said: \"Once we spread out into space and establish independent colonies, our future should be safe.\" Scientists Dirk' Schulze-Makuch and Paul Davies also call it a \"desirable goal\", though there surely are huge risks to explore new lands. \n Question: Which of the following is TRUE about the Hundred Years Starship? \n Options: (A) It has cost NASA around $10 billion.

In short, extreme weather seems to be becoming the new normal. Weather extremes are not that extreme any more. Heatwaves, droughts and wildfires are the new reality of a warming world. And this should not come as a surprise. Scientists have been warning for years that as the planet heats up, we will have to deal with more dreadful weather. Although not every extreme weather event is the result of climate change, scientists are now much more confident about connecting weather events with climate change. In 2011, the UK had a warm November. Researchers say that it was at least 60 times more likely to happen because of climate change than because of natural changes in the earth's weather systems. All the news shows that climate breakdown is occurring faster than most climate scientists had expected. But isn't it too expensive to stop the climate from changing? Well, yes it costs. So everything is just as usual. It would be wrong to believe that to let things continue as they always do is the cheap choice. Instead, it is very expensive. Just one example: droughts in the US, Russia and the Ukraine sent food prices to a record high. According to the World Bank, the price for corn increased by 113% in some markets in Mozambique and in Sudan. This is the kind of cost that often gets ignored. I believe intelligent climate action can help create new opportunities for jobs in Europe, for encouraging creativity and competitiveness, for spending less money on energy. \n Question: According to the passage, in 2012   _  . \n Options: (A) the UK had a warm November (B) the US had many wildfires (C) the UK had a dry summer (D) East Africa had little rain", "output": "D", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

Poaching has worried environmentalists for years and, despite laws, this terrible crime has yet to be stopped.  Poaching is a serious problem, especially in Africa and Asia. This crime is done for commercial profit  , meaning hunters kill animals illegally and sell their most worthy parts. Although poachers usually hunt tigers, elephants and rhinos, they kill sharks and whales, too. This illegal hunting has led to decreasing populations of many species.  Many nations have banned poaching, but enforcement   is difficult. The small number of police officers trained to deal with this creates an unfair advantage for poachers. Poachers usually kill animals for only one product: tigers are killed for their striped fur, elephants their ivory tusks and rhinos their large horn. The bodies of the animals are left to rot. Sharks' fins are cut off and their bodies thrown back into the ocean. Without fins they can't swim and will die. The illegally obtained fins are used to make shark fin soup.  The laws that \"protect\" animals are no more than pieces of paper. The current poaching bans need better enforcement, and I have a plan. The number of enforcers needs to be increased so that there are enough to watch the herds and make sure poachers can't shoot the animals. The reserve parks in Africa should become a huge zoo so that the animals can move but within a fenced area. Another idea is to build a concrete enclosure instead of fences. Watchtowers could be constructed so enforcers can monitor a wide variety of poacher targets. This may not completely end the problem, but it would slow it down. Poaching is a serious problem and a criminal act. The effects of poaching will be felt for centuries to come, and if there are any still alive, the only place to see animals might be in a zoo. \n Question: Poaching has not been stopped mainly because   _  . \n Options: (A) there are no laws to ban this crime (B) this crime has not been that serious (C) effective measures have not been taken (D) the author's plan has not been adopted", "output": "C", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

She rolled down the window, fifty feet away from the driveway and spit her gum  out of the window. \"Couldn't you just wait five seconds and put your gum where it belongs?\" I asked, annoyed. She was not the only one who was gum-lazy. Consider the following. Every time I brush chewed gum under my desk, I shake with fright. At Folsom Middle School, whenever I had to walk by the gum wall next to the girls' locker room, I felt totally disgusted. When I was young, I walked outside during my dance show in my ballet shoes, always stepping right on a big and juicy piece of bubble gum. I was extremely upset. The worst part of all these incidents is that a trash can is located near. But some people are too lazy to walk towards it. If you can't be a responsible gum chewer, don't chew at all. That's all I'm going to say. Take Singapore as a good example. The chewing gum ban in Singapore was placed. It bans the import and sale of chewing gum in Singapore, whether for the purpose of trade or personal chewing. However, the ban has been partly lifted with some types of gum, such as medical gum, allowable. This comes with the warning that it is sold only by a druggist, who has to take down the names of buyers. Obviously, the Singapore government gets angry at gum stuck in keyholes of mailboxes and on elevator buttons. Not only is it annoying, but chewing gum can actually do harm to the health. Most gum contains aspartame  , a chemical sweetener that the US government is now deciding whether or not it is a deadly chemical. If it is, it may cause cancer. Other studies suggest that aspartame may cause neurological disorders. Therefore, aspartame is not allowed to use in the US. So just say no to chewing gum. \n Question: What did the author think of the woman's behavior? \n Options: (A) It was strange. (B) It was unacceptable. (C) It was dangerous.

Many people have heard stories like this. But the situation is more worrying still and it involves parents. Every child, regardless of the circumstances into which they are born, has the right to achieve their potential, regardless of their parents' wealth and class. And we recognize that, as a nation, it is a long way to achieve this goal. But with rights come responsibilities and what worries people is that we are in danger of ignoring the latter. Far too many children are behaving badly at school, even to the point of being violent to staff. This is terrible enough, but it is hard to be surprised since many children are just mirroring the behaviour of their parents. My members tell me that parents also come into school often and threaten staff and some staff have been attacked by a pupil's parents. One father encouraged his child to start a fight on the playground before school started. A primary teacher reported that a parent shouted at him. We need to have a serious and sensible debate about the roles and responsibilities of parents and the support that they can reasonably expect of schools and teachers. Children will not learn how to behave as social beings if they are stuck in front of the TV for hours every day. They need their parents to show an interest in them and to spend time with them, helping them to play with their peers  and to learn the rules of social behavior. Children are now arriving at school socially undeveloped, increasingly unable to dress themselves, unable to use the toilet properly, unable to hold a knife and fork and unused to eating at a table, Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, writes in today's Observer. Instead of taking responsibility themselves, too many parents expect teachers to control their children's behaviour and wellbeing, she adds. Bousted says one mother blamed staff when she discovered that her 16-year-old son was smoking. We are in danger of becoming a nation of _ . The bedroom, once a place to sleep, has become the living space for the young. Spending hours in front of computer screens, on social networking sites or being immersed  in computer games, children and young people spend little time with their parents. Parents are unable to monitor just what their children are watching. Schools cannot right the wrongs of society and teachers cannot become substitute parents. Both parties need to work together. Parents must be helped and given confidence to take back control. They are responsible for setting boundaries for their children's behaviour and sticking to those boundaries. They are responsible for setting a good example to their children and for devoting that most precious of resources -- time -- so that children come to school ready and willing to learn. \n Question: In the opinion of the writer, what problem do people ignore? \n Options: (A) The violence in the school (B) The study pressure of students.

She and her husband Elliott along with Harold Matt Matson started the toy company Mattel. She based the design of the new doll on a German doll named Bild Lilli and named her after their daughter Barbara. The first Barbie wore a black and white swimsuit and had her hair in a ponytail . She looked very grown-up. But any concerns that parents would not want to buy it for little girls were soon proved wrong. Mattel sold 300,000 Barbie dolls in the first year at a price of three dollars. Today, a fifty-year-old Barbie in good condition might cost more than 27,000 dollars. Barbie dolls have represented 50 different nationalities and are sold in 150 countries. Mattel says 90% of girls in the United States between the ages of three and ten own at least one Barbie doll. It says girls between the ages of three and six own an average of about 12. Barbie also faced her share of critics. A well-known example was when women's education groups objected to a talking Barbie doll that declared, among other things, \"Math class is tough!\" Mattel agreed to change it. Saudi Arabia has banned Barbie dolls. And a lawmaker in the American state of West Virginia would like to do the same.

I bike during all four seasons. In summer, I wear shorts and a T- shirt and carry a messenger bag over my shoulder for my lunch and anything else I need. Once at the office, I change into business- casual clothes. In winter, I wear layers and a thin hat under my helmet. A cold winter day can be the best time to be on a bicycle. When the air is clear, free of oppressive summer haze, the city can look beautiful. Biking to work also _ during the workday itself. I have a rack   on the back of my bike that accommodates panniers that allow me to pick up groceries. During work hours, a colleague will occasionally need to send or retrieve documents by messenger. If I have the time, I volunteer. Pedaling 30 blocks and back is a nice way to take a break from work--and to save the office a few bucks on messenger fees. I'm sure that some people thinking my mode of transportation might be afraid of Midtown traffic. I'm no hero; I don't want to get hurt riding to work. It just takes time getting used to it. There's a risk, but all travel has risks. They're worth it to me. \n Question: Which is the reason for the author cycling to work? \n Options: (A) To save money (B) To lose weight (C) To smell the roses outside (D) To protect the environment", "output": "C", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

Dancing is a real passion of many people, including me. I work hard to make myself better, and prove that I am good enough. Performing a dance routine is more than just a  performance. Dancers tell stories when they dance. It is a way for us to express our personal feelings. Just letting go and letting your body move with the music can create your emotions. Dance tells us things that our mind secretly hides. \"Get up and do it again!  You need to keep your spirits up!\" Even though I am completely worn out after my dances, I love to hear those words. It gives me a sense of relief knowing that I can again express my feelings out on the floor. \"Practice makes perfect! Come on. We have a competition this weekend, and we need to work harder!\" Competitions are the best possible example of fun. For a dancer, life cannot get better than competitions. The thrill of losing yourself onstage is a rush of energy rushing through your body! The feeling is unexplainable. As you sit there putting on your makeup, fixing your hair, and putting on your costume, the rush just gradually grows until it is ready to be released onstage. Finally the time comes to tell your story. Standing backstage waiting for your name to be called is one of the scariest moments. You are ready to show the world what you are capable of and what you have been perfecting for a while. Once your number is called, you walk out onstage. The applause at the end tells each dancer that their story has been received, and that the dance has been brought to life. \n Question: What does the author's dance teacher require her to do during the dance class? \n Options: (A) Build up her confidence.

It is only when people try to live on a very _ diet, say that when trying to lose weight, that it is necessary to make special provisions to supply the missing vitamins. An example of the dangers of a restricted diet may be seen in the disease known as \"beri-beri\", which used to make large numbers of Eastern people who lived mainly on rice suffer. In the early years of last century, a Dutch scientist named Eijkman was trying to discover the cause of beri-beri. At first he thought it was transmitted by a germ   . He was working in a Japanese hospital, where the patients were fed on polished rice which had had the outer coverings removed from the grain, it was thought this would be easier for weak and sick people to digest. Eijkman thought his germ theory was proved when he noticed the chickens in the hospital yard, which were fed on remains from the patients' plates, were also showing signs of the disease. He then tried to separate the germ, which he thought was causing the disease, but his experiments were interrupted by a hospital official, who ordered that the rice without coverings, even though left over by the patients, was too good for chickens. It should be recooked for the patients, and the chickens should be fed on cheap, rough rice with the outer coverings still on the grain. Eijkman noticed that the chickens began to recover on the new diet. He began to consider the possibility that eating unmilled rice   somehow prevented or cured beri-beri--even that a lack of some ingredient   in the coverings may be the cause of the disease. Indeed this was the case. The element needed to prevent beri-beri was shortly afterwards separated from rice coverings and is now known as vitamin B. The milled rice, though more expensive, was in fact causing the disease the hospital was trying to cure. Nowadays, this terrible disease is much less common thanks to our knowledge of vitamins. \n Question: What do we know about the disease beri-beri? \n Options: (A) It killed large numbers of people.

Since I was a little girl, if I ever wanted to purchase anything, my parents would sternly  remind me of the value of every cent, prompting me to spend my pocket money only when necessary. My mom actually came up with a system that we strictly abide  by in regards to money-spending. She gives me a certain amount of allowance  every month, and whenever I buy anything with my accumulated  money, I keep track of my receipts and record it in a little notebook, essentially a tiny version of my mom's own accounting booklet. Being in control of my own money has really taught me to be careful in how I spend my money, giving me a sense of responsibility and ownership over it. As for earning money, aside from my allowance, my parents never really encouraged me to go out and find a job at typical American occupation locales , such as restaurants or clothing stores. Instead, they would prefer that I spend my time focusing on my schoolwork, which I guess is where my parents become more traditional. Yet I still earn money here and there in little jobs, such as teaching students at my school, and of course, writing for the paper.

It is essential because we can pay money for whatever we want.Money is recognized as banknotes and coins. However,many years ago people couldn' t go to the shop and buy what they wanted.They had to get what they wanted through the barter trade .It was really difficult,for the barter often depended on coincidence of wants.For example,the seller of grain has to find a buyer who wants to buy grain and who also could offer something the seller wants to buy.And one more example,if a wheat farmer needs what a fruit farmer produces,a direct exchange is impossible because seasonal fruit would spoil before the grain harvest.The solution is to trade fruit for wheat indirectly through a third intermediate commodity ,such as cattle,salt,shells,wine.However,commodity money had their disadvantages.For example,cattle,fur,precious stones couldn' t be cut into smaller pieces and it was inconvenient to keep and transport them.Thus coins were invented. The earliest known coins in the western world came from Lydia in about 650 B.C.Greek cities,the Great Persian Empire and Roman Empire quickly adopted the new useful technique of metal currency.And by the end of the 6th century,coinages were common throughout the region.However,coins as well as commodity money had many disadvantages.For instance,coins quickly show wear  and they usually have small value,so it' s difficult to count large sums of coins. At first,paper money was used in China in about 650 A.D.After then,it was used in Persia and Japan.In Europe,paper money was firstly produced in the Netherlands in the 16th century and in the USA in the 17th century.Paper money is worthless but symbolic.In other words,paper money is just a note.It has a purchasing power because the government announces it as money and citizens accept it universally. \n Question: The writer explains the difficulty of barter trade by  _  . \n Options: (A) telling stories (B) using examples (C) presenting a theory (D) making a comparison", "output": "B", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

The book becomes an instant hit on campus. About 3,000 copies have been sold and the class is already working on the second volume. \"We're up to our ears in homework.

Although they have equal degree of health and wealth and other forts of life, one bees happy and the other bees unhappy. This arises from the different ways in which they consider things, persons, events and the resulting effects upon their minds. People who are to be happy fix their attention on the convenience of things: the pleasant parts of conversation, the well prepared dishes, the goodness of the wine and the fine weather. They enjoy all the cheerful things. Those who are to be unhappy think and speak only of the opposite things. Therefore, they are continually dissatisfied. By their remarks, they sour the pleasure of society, offend (hurt) many people, and make themselves disagreeable everywhere. If this turn of mind was founded in nature, such unhappy persons would be the more to be pitied. The intention of criticizing  and being disliked is perhaps taken up by imitation . It grows into a habit, unknown to its possessors. The habit may be strong, but it may be cured when those who have it realize its bad effects on their interests and tastes. I hope this little warning may be of service to them, and help them change this habit.  Although in fact it is chiefly an act of the imagination, it has serious results in life since it brings on deep sorrow and bad luck. Those people offend many others; nobody loves them, and no one treats them with more than the most mon politeness and respect. This frequently puts them in bad temper and draws them into arguments. If they aim at getting some advantages in social position or fortune, nobody wishes them success. Nor will anyone start a step or speak a word to favor their hopes. If they bring on themselves public objections, no one will defend or excuse them, and many will join to criticize their wrongdoings. These should change this bad habit and be pleased with what is pleasing, without worrying needlessly about themselves and others. If they do not, it will be good for others to avoid any contact  with them. Otherwise, it can be disagreeable and sometimes very inconvenient, especially when one bees mixed up in their quarrels. \n Question: People who are unhappy   _  . \n Options: (A) always consider things differently from others (B) usually are affected by the results of certain things (C) usually misunderstand what others think or say (D) always discover the unpleasant side of certain things", "output": "D", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

A new study of animal's emotions suggests that, as in humans, emotions can tell animals about how dangerous their world is, and guide the choices that they make. The article of the study by Bristol University's professor Mike Mendl was published online. An animal living in an environment where it is often threatened by predators will develop a negative emotion or \"mood\", such as anxiety. However, one in an environment with plenty of opportunities to get resources for survival will be in a more positive mood state. The researchers say that these emotional states not only show the animal's experiences, but also help it decide how to make choices, especially in unclear situations. This could have good or bad results. An animal in a negative mood state will make a safety-first with a \"pessimistic\" response to an unclear event. For example, it considers a noise in the grass as a signal of the predator. At the same time, an animal in a positive mood state will benefit from a more \"optimistic\" response. It considers the noise as a signal of prey . Professor Mike Mendl, head of the Animal Welfare and Behavior Research Group at Bristol University's School of Clinical Veterinary Science said, \" We can use \"optimistic\" or \"pessimistic\"decision-making as a symbol of an animal's emotional state. Recent studies by our group and others suggest that this is a _ new approach to studying a variety of animal species.\" \"Public interest in animal welfare remains high, with widespread concern about the way in which animals are treated, used and included in society.

Storms and huge waves are a constant threat and none of Tuvalu's nine little islands is more than five metres above sea level. Salt water is already entering the country's drinking water supply, as well as damaging plants that produce fruit and vegetable. Without urgent help, the country's days are numbered. But Tuvalu is not the first place to face sinking into the sea. Venice, a historic city in Italy best known for its canals, has sunk about 24 cm over the past 100 years. Experts say that it will have sunk another 24 cm by 2050. A century ago, St. Mark's Square, the lowest point in the city, flooded about nine times a year. Nowadays, it happens more than 100 times. While Venice is slowly sinking into the mud on which it stands, Tuvalu's rising sea level is caused by global warming. The average global temperature has increased by almost 0. 5 centigrade degrees over the past century, scientists expect it to rise by extra 1.3 degrees over the next 100 years. Warmer weather makes glaciers  melt, adding more water to the ocean. The warmer temperatures also make water expand, so it takes up more space, causing the sea level to rise. The sea level has risen 10.25 cm in the last 100 years. The main cause of global warming is human pollution. Through burning coal, oil and gas, people have been increasing the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as CO2. This adds to the power of the greenhouse effect, making the planet even warmer.

After five months of training, in which he spent ten hours a day memorizing a quarter of a million digits, David Thomas took part in a 16 - hour mental battle.Witnesses watched in awe as Thomas set a new European record, earning the title 'Most Powerful Memory in the Western Hemisphere'. David says,  \"When I was at school I was hopeless.I could' t remember anything, but now I can remember more facts than anyone in Europe.\" So how does Thomas do it? \"One night I was watching a TV programme about an interview with a man called Dominic O'Brien, who had been the world memory champion five times.He used to be a gambler, and he wasn't particularly successful until he developed his own mnemonics, or mental memory aid, for each card in order to remember which cards had already been dealt and which ones hadn't.\" Thomas became fascinated by O'Brien's theory that anyone can improve their memory by using specialized techniques.These techniques involve linking everything to familiar people or objects. \"If you want to remember a phone number for example, you have to give the numbers life.Sometimes I associate a number with a person.Number 10 for me is always the Prime Minister (who lives at number 10 Downing Street) ,\" explained David.If David is trying to remember facts he also links them to an image.\"For instance, if I was trying to memorize the name 'Tom Cruise' , I would think of his film Top Cun, and that leads me to images of guns and cruise missiles.\" is soon going to appear on TV's Record Breakers, and this week he is teaching memory training and speed - writing at Huddersfield University.His fees are PS600 a day.He is sure that the future holds a lot more for him than a job as a fire - fighter. \n Question: We learn that before setting a new European record, Thomas \n Options: (A) liked playing cards (B) trained hard in memory (C) believed he could succeed (D) received a good school education", "output": "B", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

Where Mr.Barlow found the separation between the real and virtual worlds exciting, however, critics regarded it as a cause for concern.They worried that people were spending too much time online, communicating with people they had never even met in person in chat rooms, virtual game worlds and, more recently, on social - networking sites such as MySpace and Facebook.A study carried out by the Stanford Institute for the Quantitative Study of Society in 2000, for example, found that heavy internet users spent less time talking to friends and family, and warned that the Internet could be \"the ultimate isolating( ) technology\". Both groups were wrong, of course.The Internet has not turned out to be a thing apart.Unpleasant aspects of the real world, such as taxes, crime and cheating are now characteristics of the virtual world, too.C'amers who make real money selling swords, gold and other things in virtual game worlds may now find that the tax man wants to know about it.Designers of virtual objects in Second Life, an online virtual world, are seeking to real -world lawsuits   in order to protect their intellectual property. At the same time, however, some of the most exciting uses of the Internet rely on combining it with the real world.Social networking allows people to stay in touch with their friends online, and plan social activities in the real world.The distinction between online and offline chatters does not matter any more. All these approaches treat the Internet as an extension or an attachment to the physical world, not a separate space.Rather than seeing the real and virtual fields as distinct and conflicting, in short, it makes sense to see them as complementary and connected. \n Question: According to the passage, internet supporters believed that   _  . \n Options: (A) cyberspace liberated the real world (B) the virtual world was a place without boundaries (C) cyberspace can be entered by anyone for free (D) the Internet stood for progress of technology", "output": "B", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

For several months, he lived on life support as we were forced to stand by and watch him wither away. ks5u     While his friends were out playing baseball, and sleeping in their own beds, my son was in a hospital bed, attached to a machine that kept his heart beating. As a mother, my first reaction after crying was anger, and then I played the bargaining game: \"Take my life for his, Lord. I've lived my life but he still has so much to do.\" People all around me were praying for a heart to become available, but it made me so angry and confused because I knew for that to happen, someone else's child would have to die. How could anyone pray for that?     I still remember so clearly the morning we got the call that there was a heart. As we stood in Dustin's hospital room watching them prepare him for surgery, we experienced the true definition of bittersweet. His dad and I realized that at the precise moment we were standing there with so much hope and so much love, another family somewhere was saying goodbye. We knelt down together and cried, and we prayed for them and we thanked them for giving such a selfless gift. To our amazement, just 10 days later, Dustin got to come home for the first time in many months.  He had received a second chance at life. Over the next two years, he got to go to high school, learn to drive and put his brand new heart to good use volunteering at the homeless shelter and helping the elderly. Dustin's new heart failed him when he was 16. A tragedy, yes, but we have to see it as the miracle it was. We received two precious years with him that we would never have had without organ donation. We have more pictures, more memories and a great satisfaction in knowing that he was able to experience some of the most exciting times and milestones in a teenager's life. When he died, difficult as it was for us, we knew that it would be Dustin's wish to give back. His eyes went to someone who wanted to see. Someone who, perhaps, had never seen the faces of the family he loved so dearly.

The physicist, Dario Auterio, did not try to explain what the results might mean for the laws of physics, let alone the broader world.After an hour of technical talk, he simply said, \"Therefore, we present to you today this difference, this unusualness.\" But what unusualness it may be.From 2009 through 2011, the massive OPERA detector  buried in a mountain in Gran Sasso, Italy, recorded subatomic particles called neutrinos ( ) arriving faster than light can move in an empty space.The neutrinos generated at CERN are hardly detectably early.If confirmed, the finding would throw more than a century of physics into disorder. \"If it's correct, it's _ .\" said Rob Plunkett, a scientist at Fermilab, the Department of Energy physics laboratory in Illinois.\"We'd be looking at a whole new set of rules\" for how the universe works.Those rules would bend, or possibly break, Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity, published in 1905.Basical at the time, the theory tied together space and time, matter and energy, and set a hard limit for the speed of light, later measured to be about 186, 000 miles per second. No experiment in 106 years had broken that speed limit.Physicists expect strict study to follow, which OPERA and CERN scientists welcomed. Fermilab operates a similar experiment, called MINOS, that shoots neutrinos from Illinois to an underground detector in Minnesota.In 2007, MINOS discovered a just detectable amount of faster than-light neutrinos, but the permissible difference of error was too big to \"mention\" , Plunkett said. Fermilab scientists will reanalyze their data, which will take six to eight months.In 2013, the MINOS detector, now offline, will restart after an upgrade.It could then offer confirmation of the results. \n Question: Why are the European scientists not sure about the results of the experiment? \n Options: (A) Because they are so unexpected.

During the first half of the eighteen century, however, houses began to show a new elegance.  As wealth increased, more and more colonist built fine houses.    Since architecture was not yet a specialized profession in the colonies, the design of buildings was left either to amateur   designers or to carpenters who were engaged in translating architectural handbooks imported from England.  Inventories of libraries shows an astonishing number of these handbooks for builders, and the houses built during the eighteenth century show their influence.  Nevertheless, most household architecture of the first-quarters of the eighteenth century displays a wide  _ of taste and freedom of application of the rules laid down in these books.    Increasing wealth and growing sophistication   throughout the colonies resulted in houses of improved design, whether the material was wood, stone, or brick.  New England still favored wood, though brick houses became common in Boston and other towns, where the danger of fire gave an impetus   to the use of more durable material.  A few houses in New England were built of stone, but only in Pennsylvania and areas nearby was stone widely used in buildings.  An increased use of brick in houses and outbuildings is noticeable in Virginia and Maryland, but wood remained the most popular material even in houses built by wealthy landowners.  In the Carolinas, even in closely packed Charleston, wooden houses were much common than brick houses.    Eighteenth-century houses showed great interior improvements over the former ones.  Windows were made larger and shutters removed.  Large, clear panes replaced the small leaded glass of the seventeenth century.  Doorways were larger and more decorative.    Fireplaces became decorative features of rooms.  Walls were made of plaster or wood.  White paint began to take the place of blues, yellows, greens, and lead color1s, which had been popular for walls in the earlier years.  After about 1730, advertisements for wallpaper styles in scenic patterns began to appear in colonial newspapers. \n Question: What's the passage mainly about? \n Options: (A) The improved design of eighteenth-century colonial houses. (B) A comparison of eighteenth-century houses and modern houses. (C) The decorations used in eighteenth-century houses.

In the articles that discuss the field of bio-musicology, the study of the biological basis for the creation and appreciation of music, researchers present various evidence to, show that music-making is at once an original human \"business\", and an art form with skillful performers throughout the animal kingdom. The new reports stress that humans hold no copyright on sound wisdom, and that a number of nonhuman animals produce what can rightly be called music, rather than random sound. Recent in-depth analyses of the songs sung by humpback whales show that, even when their organ would allow them to do otherwise, the animals _ the same choices relating to sounds and beauty, and accept the same laws of song composition as those preferred by human musicians, and human ears, everywhere. For example, male humpback whales, who spend six months of each year doing little else but singing, use rhythms   similar to those found in human music and musical phrases of similar length--a few seconds. Whales are able to make sounds over a range of at least seven octaves  , yet they tend to move on through a song in beautiful musical intervals, rather than moving forwards madly. They mix the sounds like drums and pure tones in a ratio   which agrees with that heard in much western music. They also use a favorite technique of human singers, the so-called A-B-A form, in which a theme is stated, then developed, and then returned to in slightly revised form. Perhaps most impressive, humpback songs contain tunes that rhyme. \"This suggests that whales use rhyme in the same way we do: as a technique in poem to help them remember complex material,\" the researchers write. \n Question: Which of the following shows the advanced musical ability in humpback whales? \n Options: (A) They can remember complex material.

A team, writing in the journal Nature Communications, reported that the hair-like structures   the creatures use to make sounds evolved from legs. The team studied caterpillars which use these structures to communicate their ownership of leaves. This means the caterpillars are able to \"tell\" strangers to go away without risking injury in conflicts. \"These are really interesting caterpillars,\" said Dr. Jayne Yack from Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, who led the research. \"They make signals using hair-like structures which are on their back ends.\" The caterpillars drag these structures across the leaf to make scraping  sounds when strangers enter their \"leaf shelters\". \"When they make this signal, the strangers leave,\" explained Dr. Yack. \"It's like saying 'I'm here, get out of here --I already own this leaf'.\" The scientists looked at other species within the same group of caterpillars and created a \"family tree\" of the creatures. They used chemical markers to work out the relationship between the animals, showing which in the group were the more ancient species and which species evolved more recently. \"Those more ancient species actually don't have these sound-producing structures. They have legs that they use to walk towards strangers,\" said Dr. Yack. These more ancient species, she explained, walk towards strangers and try to attack them. \"They can kill each other in the conflicts,\" Dr. Yack added. She said that the evolution of the scraping show had allowed the caterpillars to solve their conflicts without fighting. \"So our idea is that these signals actually avoid damage to both sides --they solve conflicts in a more 'friendly' way.\" The study also provides a map of an evolutionary path that many other biologists are exploring. \n Question: What can we learn about caterpillars' warning structures from the text? \n Options: (A) They have the same function as hair.

They tried to explain the plot of the film, but neither mine nor Julia's Chinese was good enough to fully understand what they were saying. They then asked if we would be interested in being part of the project.  I came to China to experience new things and new opportunity, and being in a movie sounded so exciting. So in less than a second, I jumped at the chance of being in the film. Julia on the other hand was not so enthusiastic. It took 30 minutes to convince her to be part of the film, and she eventually accepted the chance. That afternoon we were taken to the production company's office to meet the director and some of the cast. We all sat together, drinking tea, talking about why I and Julia were in China and about the film. It seemed a little bit like a dream. Ever since I was a small child, I dreamed of becoming a movie star, but I would never have guessed that my dream would come true, especially now in China. At the end of the talk, we were given scripts   and had a few photographs taken. We were given the production schedule and ensured that our scenes would only be shot at weekends so it wouldn't interfere   with our studies. We left the office excited about the film, but unknowing what filming was actually like. On our first day of filming, we were picked up in the early morning from the university and we drove deep into the countryside. We arrived on location and waited for our scene to be shot.

The answer is that the government needs money for many things, for example to pay its soldiers, sailors and airmen, to build roads, bridges, offices, schools, etc and to buy goods from abroad; and only the people of the country can supply the money.One of the most important taxes is income-tax which a person pays according to the amount of his income-tax.Whether he is a businessman, a doctor, a lawyer, a shopkeeper, a miner, or anything else.This is called a \"direct\" tax, because it is paid in money direct to the government. Another tax is paid on goods such as watches, jewellery, new clothes, tobacco, wine, etc, when they are brought into a country, such a tax is paid as part of the price of these goods if they are later sold in shops.We call it \"indirect\" tax, because it is paid indirectly through the shopkeeper. People usually complain about having to pay taxes, but they forget that the money is spent on the things that they and their families need.We need policemen to catch thieves, to see that men obey the laws, to direct traffic, etc, and they must be paid what they earn; children need education and there must be schools and teachers; we want our streets to be kept clean, and the wages of men who do this kind of work have to be paid.Above all, the country must always be ready to defend itself against attacking enemies, and we cannot have an army without paying for it. Taxes, therefore, cannot be avoided.We buy our own food and clothes and pay for our own amusements, but there are several things that the State finds the money for, and that are necessary for us if our society is to continue.So we have no real cause to complain when we are asked to supply money to be spent for the good of ourselves and for our fellow-citizens. \n Question: Indirect tax means   _  . \n Options: (A) tax that one pays direct to the government (B) tax that is not paid directly to the government (C) tax that is paid as an extra amount added to the price of certain goods (D) Both B and C", "output": "D", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

But then Jane Austen wrote her novels in England, she was writing about a world that most of us would not recognize. But today Austen's books are in greater demand than ever. In the last ten years, five of the six novels have been made into Hollywood films, while her books continue to be bestsellers. So why is Austen still popular? Richard Jenkyns, a professor of English at Oxford University, argues that her novels still appeal to people because they focus on issues that are as _ today as they were when she wrote them. Her novels are about women trying to find a perfect husband, but also explore issues surrounding marriage, friendship and the family. \"The plots are fairly timeless stories about human interaction which are familiar to us,\" Jenkyns says. The most famous book Austen wrote is Pride and Prejudice,a love story betweenElizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy. At first the two characters do not get on. They finally fall in love, but still have to overcome opposition   to their relationship from their families. All of Austen's books are easy to read, making them popular with children and adults, but they work on different levels so people can take what they need from them, author Kate Henry says.

Consequently, the lions might have abandoned their normal, more difficult prey and turned to humans. \"Humans are easy preys, \" said Patterson. \"We're very slow, we don't hear very well, and we don* t see very well in the darkness. \" The research calls their idea the Infirmity Theory. It was inspired partly by the work of Jim Corbett, a tiger hunter in Indiain the 1930s. Corbett was regularly called in to hunt tigers that had been dining on Indian villagers.

The scientists point to the fact that changes in the past thirty years may, have been affecting human health. Possible effects include more deaths from extreme  heat or cold, more storms and more crop failures in dry periods. The health and climate scientists recently estimated  that climate changes caused by human activity lead to more than one hundred and fifty thousand deaths each year. Cases of sickness are estimated at five million. And the W.H.O. says the numbers could rise quickly by the year of 2003. Jonathan Patz of an environmental institute led the study. Professor Patz points out that climate scientists connected global warming with the heat that killed thousands in Europe in August, 2003. But he says poor countries least responsible(......) for the warming are most in danger from the health effects of higher temperatures. Professor Patz says areas in greatest danger include southern and eastern Africa and coastlines along the Pacific and Indian oceans. Also, large cities experience what scientists call a \"heat island\"effect that can make conditions worse. Representatives  from about two hundred countries hold a meeting in Canada, to discuss climate change. The ten-day meeting ends on December 9th. It is the first such United Nations meeting since the Kyoto Protocol  took effect earlier this year. The agreement aims to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide  and other heat-trapping  gases sent off into the air. \n Question: Who is Jonathan Patz? \n Options: (A) A scientist responsible for the climate change.

The odour of a familiar human apparently lingers like perfume in the animal's brain - where it triggers an instinctive emotional response, research published yesterday reveals. Our scent acts on a part of the canine brain associated with reward and the strongest reactions are produced by humans that pets know best, say scientists in America. Gregory Berns, of Emory University in Atlanta, said: 'While we might expect that dogs should be highly tuned to the smell of other dogs, it seems that the \"reward response\" is reserved for their humans. 'When humans smell the perfume or cologne of someone they love, they may have an immediate, emotional reaction that's not necessarily cognitive. 'Our experiment may be showing the same process in dogs. But since dogs are so much more olfactory  than humans, their responses would likely be even more powerful than the ones we might have. 'It's one thing when you come home and your dog sees you and jumps on you and licks you and knows that good things are about to happen. 'In our experiment, however, the scent donors were not physically present. Why do animals avoid pylons? Because they emit terrifying flashes of light that are INVISIBLE to humans. Dolphins use sponges to protect their sensitive noses while foraging for food on the sea floor 'That means the canine brain responses were being triggered by something distant in space and time. It shows that dogs' brains have these mental representations of us that persist when we're not there.' The university's experiment - the first of its type - involved 12 dogs of various breeds who underwent brain scans while five different scents were placed in front of them. The scent samples came from the subject itself, a dog the subject had never met, a dog that lived in the subject's household, a human the dog had never met, and a human that lived in the subject's household. The familiar human scent samples were taken from someone else from the house other than the handlers during the experiment, so that none of the scent donors were physically present. The results showed that all five scents elicited a similar response in parts of the dogs' brains involved in detecting smells. Responses were significantly stronger for the scents of familiar humans, followed by that of familiar dogs. The findings, which were published in the journal Behavioural Processes, showed that dogs reacted strongest to the scent of a familiar human even when they were not there. Pets trained as help or therapy dogs showed greater brain activity than the other dogs in the test. Researchers say the findings could improve the way animals who assist wounded veterans or disabled people are selected. \n Question: Why does your dog look pleased to see you ? \n Options: (A) because your dog wants to play with you (B) because your dog is hungry (C) because your dog wants to attract your attention (D) because your dog loves the particular way you smell.", "output": "D", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

It ended up landing a few feet from Blake (lane5).

But one day in a train something did happen. I do not mean that I was hurt: no one was hurt. I do my work in a hot country far away from England. Every September I go there to do my business, and every July I come back to England to have a rest. So every September I go to Paris and take a train from the great French city to Mendova, and at Mendova I catch my ship. There is one very fast train from Paris to Mendova, and it suits me well. It goes as far as Endoran, but it stops at Mendova for a few minutes to let travelers get out or in. It is called The Flying Bluebird. It reaches Mendova at seven minutes past nine in the morning, and it is never late. A ship leaves Mendova at half past eleven, and so you will understand that The Flying Bluebird suits me very well. I always travel by it, and I have nearly two and a half hours at Mendova to go from the station to the ship. That is more than enough time. Well, one September night, I took my place in The Flying Bluebird as usual. The train leaves Paris at nine o'clock every night, and I was in my place soon after half past eight. There were three or four people there with me, but very soon a lot of others got into the train. When no more people could sit down, they began to stand up near us and also in the corridor . In a short time the corridor was full too, and it was impossible for any more travelers to get into the train. I could see a lot of other people outside the corridor windows, but they could not get in, and the train left Paris without them. The man sitting next to me started to ask all kinds of questions: \"Where do you work? How long does it take you to get there? Are you married? How many children do you have? How much money do they pay you every year? How much do you have in the bank? How much do you spend every month?\" He asked questions for about twenty minutes but I did not give him any clear answers, and at last he stopped and began to read the paper. I usually sleep quite well in the train, but this time I slept only a little. There were too many people, and there were too many things: small bags, large bags, coats, hats, boxes, newspapers and food. As usual, we got angry about the window. Most people wanted it shut, and two of us wanted it open. But that always happens. It was shut all night, as usual. When I awoke in the early morning I felt hot and dirty, and glad that the journey was reaching its end. At seven minutes past nine The Flying Bluebird stopped. We were at Mendova, and I stood up thankfully. I took my two suitcases, held one in each hand, and tried to move towards the door into the corridor. In order to get out of the train, I had to pass down the corridor to the door at the far end. There was no other way out. I could not even into the corridor. There was a suitcase on the floor by my feet, and three men were standing in my way. I felt a touch of fear. I had to get out, you see; I had to catch my ship, which left at half past eleven. And the train did not stop again until it reached Endoran, two hundred miles away. \"I must get out!\" I cried. Everyone there understood me, but no one could move. At last I was able to put one foot over the suitcase on the floor, and I nearly reached the door into the corridor. But then, very slowly, the train began to move. It was taking me away! \"Stop!\" I cried. \"I want to get out!\" But no one outside the train could hear me, and the people inside did not care much. The train moved a little faster. What could I do? I was not even in the corridor. Fear made me think quickly. In front of my eyes, just, above the door, was a notice that told everyone how to stop the train. I had to pull an iron thing near the notice. I did not waste time. I pulled it. Well, _ That was to show everyone that there was something wrong. It was not a small sound.

We were living in College Station, Texas and my wife and I were on our way home from Houston, Texas one Saturday morning. We decided to stop at a local restaurant to get something to eat since we had enough time. When we finished, we got back into our car and before I started it, we noticed a homeless man standing in front of the building. His clothes were worn and it looked as though he didn't have any money. It was cold and I was sure he wanted something warm to drink; however, it was not this that I remember, because that is not what \"moved\" me. A dog was also walking up to the front of the building. Being a dog owner, I knew that the dog was a mother, and that she had just had some pups  . She was hungry and weak and I felt bad for her. I knew if she didn't eat soon, she and her pups would not live. People walking by didn't even notice her. She was not as pretty and clean as most dogs, but she still deserved   better. We still did not do anything, but someone else did. The homeless man, who I thought could not afford anything to eat, went into the store and bought dog food with all the money he had. \n Question: Where did the story happen? \n Options: (A) In front of the local restaurant.

Fred Epstein, in his book I Make It to Five, tells a story he heard from one of his friends about Tom, a four-year-old boy with a cancer in his back bone. He came through several operations and a lot of pain by mastering his imagination. Tom loved to pretend, and he particularly loved to play superheroes. Dr. Epstein explained that it was actually a brilliant way for his young mind to handle the terrifying and painful life he led. The day before his third trip to the operating room, Tom was terribly afraid. \"Maybe I could go as Superman,\" he whispered to his mom. Hearing this, the mother hesitated for a while. She has avoided buying the expensive costume , but finally she agreed. The next day Tom appeared as the powerful Superman, showing off through the hospital halls and coolly waving his hand to the people greeting him along the way. And Tom, with the strength of his fantasy, successfully made it through the operation. The power of imagination need not be reserved for children only. We all have the power to use our fantasies to attempt things we never thought possible, to go through those things that seem impossible, and to achieve what we never believed we could.

Be very careful when you are around him.\" AIDS wasn't something we talked about in my country when I was growing up. From then on, I knew that this would be a family secret. My parents were not together anymore, and my dad lived alone. For a while, he could take care of himself. But when I was 12, his condition worsened. My father's other children lived far away, so it fell to me to look after him. We couldn't afford all the necessary medication for him, and because Dad was unable to work, I had no money for school supplies and often couldn't even buy food for dinner. I would sit in class feeling completely lost, the teacher's words muffled as I tried to figure out how I was going to manage. I did not share my burden   with anyone. I had seen how people reacted to AIDS. Kids laughed at classmates who had parents with the disease. And even adults could be cold. When my father was moved to the hospital, the nurses would leave his food on the bedside table even though he was too weak to feed himself. I had known that he was going to die, but after so many years of keeping his condition a secret, I was completely unprepared when he reached his final days. Sad and hopeless, I called a woman at the nonprofit National AIDS Support. That day, she kept me on the phone for hours. I was so lucky to find someone who cared. She saved my life. I was 15 when my father died. He took his secret away with him, having never spoken about AIDS to anyone, even me. He didn't want to call attention to AIDS. I do. \n Question: Which of the following statements about Kerrel's father is true? \n Options: (A) He had stayed in the hospital since he fell ill. (B) He depended on the nurses in his final days.

So far the month-long test of the new system has gone smoothly. For your convenience, we have included a copy of the envelope below to allow you to record the days you have ordered lunch for your child. You can keep this copy at home for your reference. Please note, lunches are prepared using the School Food Guidelines both in terms of items served and size. During the first two weeks some people wrote in additions to the menu, such as ordering extra items. Due to the logistics   involved and our limited volunteer base we are unable to fulfill these requests.  Ordering process: This year we will distribute a two week lunch envelope. If you decide to order the meal offered on a given day, simply check the box in front of that meal choice. For example, if you choose seven meals over the two weeks, then please enclose (7 x $2.00) fourteen dollars ($14.00) in the envelope. Seal it, and return it to your child's teacher. Please note that the cost for the lunch remains the same: $2.00 daily and includes fruit and milk. You will note that we have also reduced daily choices. For example on Fridays, we offered chicken burgers and hamburgers. This has been changed to chicken burgers on one week and hamburgers the following week. Food prepared according to special requests has also been changed. These items will now be prepared with the same ingredients. If your child does not like the lunch being served on a particular day please ensure that he/she has a packed lunch from home.

Each participant sat in a room with 16 loudspeakers at different locations. The room was designed so that there were no echoes  During the experiment, the speakers irregularly produced sounds. Participants had to point to where the sounds were coming from. Meanwhile, the researchers monitored blood flow in the brains of the participants to see which brain structures were working during the task.  The results showed that five of the blind participants were very good at pointing to where sounds were coming from. In these people, blood flow increased in the visual cortex --- an area at the back of the right side of the brain. This part of the brain is usually associated with vision.  The other seven blind participants showed no increase in activity in the visual cortex. These people didn't do very well at picking out where sounds were coming from.

Researchers examined the diets of 84,493 women from 50 to 79 years old. The women who consumed a lot of baked fish like salmon received stronger benefits than those who consumed mostly tuna, grouper or white fish. The consumption of baked fish also appeared to provide protection against high blood pressure cardiovascular disease . It also found that those women who consumed more baked fish tended to have a lower body mass index , exercise more and consume more fruits and vegetables in comparison to those who consumed fried fish.     Researchers note that past research has discovered that the fatty acids in fish probably decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease by decreasing inflammation  and improving blood pressure along with heart and blood vessel functioning. This study does show the link between fish consumption and heart failure risk but it was not designed to show cause and effect.     This study also showed that just by consuming one serving of fried fish a week was linked to a 49% greater risk of heart failure. It also found that the consumption of fried fish was linked to a lower fiber intake and a higher calorie intake. Dr Lloyd-Jones, associate professor with North-western's Feinberg School of Medicine, states frequent consumption of baked fish appears to be part of a suitable pattern that is greatly beneficial for numerous things. This advocates that fish is a very good source of lean protein that we should be increasing as a part of our diet.

So, automakers are focused on safety systems more than ever before.  Given the emphasis on improving safety, it's possible that well-known phrases such as \"live fast and die young\" may lose their meaning as innovative   new devices are built into cars and trucks and other things that go. Many of the new safety systems that are being added to high-end vehicles are computer-assisted technologies that transfer some of the vehicle's operations to the vehicle itself, rather than relying only on the driver's decision-making skills.   For example, predictive brake assist is an in-vehicle feature that prepares the vehicle for braking when its built-in sensors detect a potential object ahead. The predictive brake assist basically places the vehicle's braking system on alert, which helps the system to slow down the car in as little time and as short a distance as possible. Other in-vehicle sensors will detect moving and still objects and will even distinguish the objects based on simple patterns, such as other vehicles vs. a person.  What's more, built-in \"active systems\", i.e., predictive precollision   systems, will provide drivers with advance detection of potential contact between vehicles. These systems compute the   movement of the objects and detect possible dangerous intersections  . What technological developments have enabled innovations like predictive precollision systems? Essentially, these so-called active systems are the result of vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications.  These communication links allow highways to provide a vehicle's owners with services such as renting a movie during the trip, as well as reduce reaction delays when medical care is needed due to a crash.   Despite these new technologies, drivers cannot take safety for granted.  Until all vehicles are fully automated, it is the drivers themselves who are responsible for operating their vehicles and obeying traffic laws designed to keep roadways secure. So, keep your eyes on the road and your hands on the steering wheel  . \n Question: \"Predictive Precollision\" can be used to   _  . \n Options: (A) detect possible dangerous crossroads (B) compute the   movement of the contacting vehicles (C) brake the car automatically in as little time as possible (D) detect potential contacts between vehicles in advance", "output": "D", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

Not long ago,my wife,PJ,and I tried a new diet--not to lose a little weight but to answer an annoying question about climate change.Scientists have reported recently that the world is heating up even faster than predicted only a few years ago,and that the consequences could be severe if we don't keep reducing emission of carbon dioxide(CO2)and other greenhouse gases that are trapping heat in our atmosphere. We decided to try an experiment.For one month we recorded our personal emission of CO2.We wanted to see how much we could cut back,so we went on a strict diet.The average US household produces about 150 pounds of CO2a day by doing common things like turning on air conditioning or driving cars.That's more than twice the European average and almost five times the global average,mostly because Americans drive more and have bigger houses.But how much should we try to reduce? For an answer,I checked with Tim Flannery,author of The Weather Makers:How Man Is Changing the Climate and What It Means for Life on Earth.In his book,he had challenged readers to make deep cuts in personal emission to keep the world from reaching extremely important _ ,such as the melting  of the ice sheets in Greenland or West Antarctica.\"To stay below that point,we need to reduce CO2emission by 80 percent,\"he said. Good advice,I thought.I'd opened our bedroom windows to let in the wind.We'd gotten so used to keeping our air-conditioning going around the clock.I'd almost forgotten the windows even opened.We should not let this happen again.It's time for us to change our habits if necessary. \n Question: Why did the author and his wife try a new diet? \n Options: (A) To take special kinds of food.

If you plan to visit the Shanghai Expo this summer, China Pavilion is a must-see area for you. China Pavilion, which is called Oriental Crown , is located at the center of the Expo site. Standing 63 meters tall, the China Pavilion takes the shape of an emperor's crown, with the upper layers larger than the lower ones. Covering 160,000 square meters in floor space, the pavilion consists of a national hall and a regional hall. Construction on the China Pavilion began on December 18, 2007. The design of the China Pavilion was picked from a total of 344 designs put forward by Chinese from around the world. The pavilion possesses both traditional and modern features, which helps develop the theme of the 2010 Expo: \" Better City, Better Life\". For example, it is red in appearance, which contains the elements of traditional Chinese culture, and it is green indoors, with the use of energy-saving techniques. The Shanghai World Expo is expected to attract 70 million visitors from across the globe. It is estimated that 400,000 people will visit the Expo and its 140 pavilions every day during the period, but the China Pavilion is only able to receive about one tenth of the total. How to accommodate so many people in the pavilion remains a tough task. Luckily, the China Pavilion is built as a permanent landmark. During the Expo, the main structure will be used for an exhibition based on the theme of \" Chinese wisdom in urban development\" by explaining the values of harmony, nature and spirit. The three-story pavilion has three sections. The top floor's \"Footprint of the East\" will show some of the changes in Chinese cities. There, you can see a film which shows how Chinese cities have changed, especially in the past 30 years. According to Lu Chuan, director of the film, the scenery is like something from Lord of the Rings. On the second floor, \"Journey of Wisdom\" will explain China's four great inventions. And the ground's \"Blossoming City\" will display scenes from cities of the future. \n Question: Which of the following words can be used to describe the China Pavilion? \n Options: (A) Tiny (B) Round (C) Exotic (D) Environmentally-friendly", "output": "D", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

For years, medical experts have studied nostalgia and the reasons for it. Many experts warn that too much nostalgia is harmful. They say linger   in the past shows that a person is unhappy with his present life. These feelings keep the person from living his life to its fullest. Dr. Louise Kaplan has written several books about nostalgia. She says these feelings often begin when a young person is between 13 and 19 years old. \"This is the time when you must face the loss of your childhood, \" Kaplan says. \"You see your new life is easily destroyed. But you think romantically about a golden past. You remember your childhood as a time when life was perfect.\" These feelings continue as a person gets older, Kaplan adds. She says many grown persons have a hard time keeping up with changes in the modem world, so they think back to their younger years. At that time the world seemed simple and more harmless. Kaplan says these feelings are not always actually existing. The good old days weren't always good. However, she says nostalgia can be helpful, if used properly. \"Feelings of nostalgia can cause you to remember a time when you had high hopes and dreams, \" Kaplan says. \"It might give you the strong wish to catch those dreams today, in your present life.\" She adds that nostalgia can prevent you from \"cutting yourself off from your aim.\" \"At its best, \" Kaplan says, \"nostalgia has the ideas for the future.\" \n Question: According to the passage, feelings of nostalgia    _   . \n Options: (A) can cause you to think of your past which was full of hopes and dreams (B) can make you succeed in life (C) fill one with hopes for the future (D) bring about a love for the past and a hope for the future", "output": "A", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

For whatever reason, we all seem afraid to ask for help, even from those closest to us, regardless of whether we need or deserve it. There's something in our society than seems to dictate that we have to do it all by ourselves ---- either the views that we'll be seen as weak, or just simply pride. This, however, doesn't seem to be true of successful people. They haven't bought into the fallacy that asking for help is wrong. They know the truth that great things are achieved when people cooperate. We all have different skills, knowledge and experiences. Each person you know is a whole new set of untapped reference material and expertise. So if you want to get hold of it and use it, all you have to do is ask them. People are rarely unwilling to assist ---- it's in our nature to be part of communities. A good example I sometimes use in seminars is to pick a delegate at random and ask him how many people he knows in total. The usual answer is somewhere between 200 and 500. For the sake of this illustration, let's select the lower figure and call it 200. Then I ask the person how many people each of those people knows. On the assumption that they have similar-sized circles, they almost certainly know at least 200 people each. On this basis, the people within one degree of separation(1:)for a person who knows 200 people comes to 40,000 ---- can you imagine the size of that experience and knowledge pool? Looking as it this way, giving your friends, family and colleagues the opportunity to help you open your resource bank to thousands of people. That's a whole army of potential volunteers all waiting to be praised! So, next time you need help, don't suffer in silence. Pick up the phone or mention it to a friend.

Millions of schoolchildren are helping themselves to vegetables from salad bars in their lunchrooms, and kids' meals at Olive Garden and Red Lobster restaurants come with a side of fruit or vegetables and a glass of low-fat milk. These changes are taking place due to the campaign against childhood fatness, for which the first lady Michelle Obama began fighting three years ago.  Fatness has become a serious problem in the country. About one-third of U.S. children are overweight, which puts them at increased risk for any number of deadly illnesses, including high blood pressure and heart disease.  Still, Mrs. Obama faces challenge. Not everyone welcomes her effort. Some blame her for going too far and say she has no right to tell what people should and shouldn't eat. But nutrition supporters and others praise her for using her influence to help bring interests to the table. They said the first lady has raised public awareness about fatness, which will help decrease childhood fatness rates. There is evidence of small decrease in childhood fatness rates in some parts of the country. New York reported a 5.5 percent drop in fatness rates in kindergarteners through eighth-graders between the 2006-07 and 2010-11 school years. In Philadelphia, the drop was 4.7 percent among students in grades K-12. Fighting against children fatness is hard work, but it's well worth the effort. The first lady is planning a promotional tour. She has been talking up the campaign against childhood fatness on daytime and late-night TV shows and on the radio. She also plans discussions next week on Google and Twitter. \"We've been spending a lot of time educating and re-educating families and kids on how to eat, what to eat,\" the first lady said. \"We're starting to see some changes and we're starting to show some improvement.\" \n Question: What is the purpose of the campaign started by the first lady? \n Options: (A) To call on healthy eating.

Taken by a British diver who was following the sperm whale  calf, _ show the minute the baby - who had lost track of its mum - found her again in the sea off the Azores. Soaring 30ft across the waves, the newborn slammed its body onto the water with joy after becoming separated from its family group in the chilly waters. But the whale calf was doing more than just jumping for joy. British biologist and dive guide Justin Hart, 44, who took the pictures, says that young whales communicate with older ones in the ocean by creating a slamming sound which travels through the water to the ears of the adults deep below. By leaping out of the water and slamming its 12ft long body onto the surface of the sea up to 30 times, the baby whale is telling its relatives where it is so they can regroup. He said: \"We had been following the sperm whale calf for most of the day. Sperm whales, of all the whales and dolphins, are the species that dive the deepest and for the longest time.\" \"The calves have to follow what's going on below them from the surface as best they can probably listening to the echo location clicks of the adults.\" \"However, sometimes the adults re-surface far out of sight of the calf, and in this situation the whales often leap out of the water causing a large bang as their bodies hit the surface. In this way, the whale family could regroup.\" He added: \"When I took the photo, two adults' females had just resurfaced and the calf quite literally began jumping for joy.\" Mr. Hart captured the rare image four miles from the port of Lajes do Pico while he was working as a crewman on an underwater documentary with special license to film sperm whales in the area. Sperm whales live in nearly all the world's oceans in groups of about 15 to 20 animals and they practice communal  childcare. The calves do not have to follow their mother too closely as sperm whales can take milk from any milk-producing female in its social group. \n Question: According to Justin Hart, the young sperm whale   _  . \n Options: (A) found its family with his help (B) suffered a lot in the cold waters (C) lost contact with its family for days (D) slammed as a means of communication", "output": "D", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

Families and friends gather to eat and give thanks for their blessing. Thanksgiving Day is really a harvest festival. This is why it is celebrated in late fall, after the crops are get in. But one of the first thanksgivings in America had nothing to do with a good harvest. On December 4,1619, the Pilgrims from England landed near what is now Charles City, Virginia. They knelt down and thanked God for their safe journey across the Atlantic. The first New England Thanksgiving did celebrate a rich harvest. The Pilgrims landed at what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1620. They had a difficult time and the first winter was cruel. Many of the Pilgrims died. But the next year, they had a good harvest. So Governor Bradford declared a three-day feast . The Pilgrims invited Indian friends to join them for their special feast. Everyone brought food. In time, other colonies began to celebrate a day of thanksgiving. But it took years before there was a national Thanksgiving Day. During the Civil War, Sarah Josepha Hale persuaded Abraham Lincoln to do something about it. He proclaimed the last Thursday of November in 1863 as a day of thanksgiving. Today, Americans celebrate this happy harvest festival on the fourth Thursday in November. Canadians celebrate Thanksgiving Day in much the same way as their American neighbours. But the Canadian Thanksgiving Day falls on the second Monday in October. \n Question: Thanksgiving Day is celebrated   _  . \n Options: (A) in spring (B) in summer (C) in autumn (D) in winter", "output": "C", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

Many people insist that ideas about right and wrong are merely personal opinions. Some voices, though, are calling Americans back to traditional moral values. William J. Bennett, former U.S. Secretary of Education, edited the Book of Virtues in 1993 to do just that. Bennett suggests that great moral stories can build character. The success of Bennett ' s book shows that many Americans still believe in moral values. But what are they?     One of the most basic moral values for Americans is honesty. The well-known legend about George Washington and the cherry tree tells this value clearly. Little George cut down his father's favorite cherry tree while trying out his new axe. When his father asked him about it, George said honestly, \"I can not tell a lie. I did it with my axe.\" Instead of punishment, George received his father's praise for telling the truth.  Sometimes American honesty-being open and direct-can offend people.  But Americans still believe that \"honesty is the best policy.\"      Another virtue Americans respect is perseverance. Remember Aesop's fable( )about the rabbit and the turtle that had a race? The rabbit thought he could win easily, so he took a nap. But the turtle finally won because he didn't give up.      Sympathy may be the queen of American virtues. The story of \"The Good Samaritan\" from the Bible describes a man who showed sympathy. On his way to a certain city, a Samaritan man found a poor traveler lying on the road. The traveler had been beaten and robbed. The kind Samaritan, instead of just passing by, stopped to help this person in need.      In no way can these brief descriptions cover all the moral values honored by Americans. Responsibility, loyalty, courage, gratitude and many others could be discussed. In fact, Bennett's bestseller-over 800 pages-highlights just 10 virtues. Even Bennett admits that he has only covered the surface. But no matter how long or short the list is, moral values are invaluable, they are the foundation of American culture-and any culture. \n Question: At least how many kinds of moral virtues does the writer list in this passage? \n Options: (A) Three (B) Four (C) Seven (D) Ten", "output": "C", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

Yes, we humans are very sensitive to others' mistakes. And the same is true for other animals. Animals mess up all the time. They might eat poisonous leaves, fall off a tree or let their prey   slip away. By watching others fail, an animal can avoid making the same mistakes, thus improving its chance of survival. Scientists suspected that one part of the brain helps animals process information about others' errors. Cells in that part appear to become more active when a person sees someone else making a mistake. But researchers didn't know whether individual cells in this part of the brain play different roles in _ errors. To investigate the brain's response to errors in more detail, the researchers taught a game to two macaques, a type of monkey. One monkey could press a yellow or green button while the other watched. If the first monkey pressed the right button, the team gave both animals a treat. Every couple of rounds, the two monkeys switched roles. Meanwhile, the scientists monitored individual cells in the animal's brains. When the first monkey messed up the game by pressing the wrong button, a group of cells in the second monkey's brain fired. But if the second monkey also made the wrong choice during its turn, some of the cells in that group didn't respond. Those unresponsive cells reacted specifically to mistakes made by others, not to the monkey's own mistakes.

The authorities are doing their best to arise the public awareness of the vital importance of the environmental protection. This issue is, indeed, worth following up.     Environmental protection is closely related not only to our personal life, but also to the entire human race and the world's further development. For one thing, the environment, in a narrow sense, determines the quality of our individual life. The air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, etc. , all come directly from the environment. If they continue to be contaminated, we may have neither clean water, nor healthy food. For another thing, in a broader sense, the environment plays a decisive role in fate of mankind. As is known to all, the earth, up to now, is human being's only dwelling place. We can expect that some day we will live on another planet, but I doubt that this day will come earlier than the day when the earth becomes a globe of waste, if we keep damaging the environment. Finally, the environment is essential to the further development of the world. Extensive industrialization, which has brought about all the convenience and facilities we enjoy today, has been depending on the comprehensive exploitation of the earth's natural resources found in the environment. If we do not protect the environment properly, further development cannot be guaranteed. In a word, to protect the environment is an urgent task.     Nevertheless, environmental protection is indeed a demanding task. Many people are still, either unconscious of the urgency of the task or deliberately damaging the environment for the interests of their own. Hence, we should adopt severe measures to prohibit people from doing more harms to the environment. Meanwhile, we need to make the gravity of the present situation known to all. In other words, punishment and instruction should be equally emphasized. Only in this way can we look forward to a cleaner and greener world. \n Question: The author's purpose in writing the passage is to   _  . \n Options: (A) stress the importance of protecting environment (B) enjoy beautiful environment happily (C) try to develop our industrialization fast (D) take severe measures to the environmental destroyers", "output": "A", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

An old man, who suffered a lot from Parkinson's disease, was not able to talk clearly and could hardly write his name. Living totally alone, he managed to keep in touch with nearly all the members of his family. How did he achieve this? He clicked out words on his computer keyboard.

Naming all the good things about online communication is not easy. But wait. E-mail can be inconvenient. It can waste time and energy. Just think what may happen when you take a short vacation and return to find your e-mail box filled with 200 unread messages. You could easily spend half a day clearing _ ads.

Now, a new study that began with about 1,000 children in New Zealand has tracked how a child's low self-control can predict poor health, money troubles and even a criminal record in their adult years. Researchers have been studying this group of children for decades now. They observed the level of self-control the youngsters displayed. Parents, teachers, even the kids themselves, scored the youngsters on measures like \"acting before thinking\" and \"Persistence in reaching goals.\" The study led  by Moffitt of Duke University and colleagues followed 1,000 children from birth to age 32 in Dunedin, New Zealand. \"The children who had the lowest self-control when they were age three to ten, later on had the most health problems in their 30s,\" Moffitt said,\"and they had the worst financial situation. They were more likely to have a criminal record and to be raising a child as a single parent on a very low income.\" Moffitt explained that self-control problems were widely observed, and weren't just a feature of a small group of misbehaving kids. Moffitt said it's still unclear why some children have better self-control than others, though she said other researchers have found that it's mostly a learned behavior, with relatively little genetic influence. But good self-control can be set to run in families because children with good self-control are more likely to grow up to be healthy and prosperous parents. But the good news, Moffitt said, is that self-control can be taught by parents, and through school curricula that have been shown to be effective. \n Question: Children with low self-control are more likely to_. \n Options: (A) become wealthy in later life (B) get good school performance (C) have better financial planning (D) adopt negative behaviors", "output": "D", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

Now, a study has found that while this is certainly true, men also have to deal with the fact that they are also more stupid than the fairer sex.     In the study, scientists measured the IQ of 2500 brothers and sisters and they found an uneven number of men not only in the top two percent, but also in the bottom two percent. The study's participants were tested on science, maths, English and mechanical abilities.     Though there were twice as many men as women in the smartest group, there were also twice as many men among the foolish.       The total scores of men and women were similar.     One of the study's authors, psychology professor Timothy Bates, said that the phenomenon may be because men have always been expected to be high achievers and women have been restricted to spend more time taking care of their home.     \"The female developmental program may be tilted more towards ensuring survival and the safety of the middle ground.\"the Daily Mail quoted Professor Bates, of Edinburgh University, as saying.     The research agrees with past results that men were more likely than women to receive first class University degrees or thirds and women secured the seconds.     It has been said that men are more ready to take a risk when it comes to academics. While women have always been found to be steadier in their learning.     A past study has shown that women are securing more firsts and seconds, while men are continuing to receive more thirds.

I have to draw every single day of my life. I have to draw about 20 ideas. My advice is to put aside a certain amount of time every day and make you draw or whatever, especially when you don't feel like it. Only in this way will you be able to perfect your talent. The first step you take is to go to your local library and ask for the publications issued in the current years. When you get these publications, try to find the names of the top people concerned and their presidents. After you find these, write down their names and addresses. Keep this list and update it every year. Next thing you want to do is to create at least 40 cartoons. Get a grid  from one of the strips in the newspapers, enlarge it to whatever size you wish and draw inside this grid. Now take the best 20 of your ideas and make them into finished pieces. To do this, you would want to copy them in ink because if you were a professional cartoonist, that was what you should do. Now you can reduce the size of the finished cartoons to fit onto a regular comic's page. By comparing yours with the others already in print, it gives you a good idea of clarity to your cartoon. The next step is to write letters to presidents of the publication. In the letters, explain who you think would read your work, or in other words, what group do you think you would target. After you complete these, send all of your information enclosed with letters in the appropriate envelope. Now as soon as you send out these letters, start to create a brand new strip with all new characters. Don't _ because if your idea gets turned down then you will give up. And always remember. If you receive a rejection from any of them, keep in mind that you are working on something better.

But how do you get local food if you live in a large city, hundreds of miles away from farms?Environmental health scientist Dickson Despommier and his students came up with the idea of a \"vertical farm\". A vertical farm is a glass-walled structure that could be built as tall as a skyscraper.Since the garden is built upwards, rather than outwards, it requires much less space than an ordinary farm.The world is quickly running out of room for ordinary farming.Vertical farms could be a key to this situation.Despommier imagines a 30-story building with a greenhouse on every floor.The walls of the building would be clear, to allow crops to get as much sunlight as possible.Depending on a city's water resources, Despommier thinks hydroponic  farming is another method for the vertical farm which needs no soil to grow plants. Despommier says the hydroponic greenhouses would use a system that would use a city's waste water and fill it with nutrition to make the crops grow.If this method works, it would provide food to a city and save millions of tons of water. The idea of a vertical farm has attracted the attention of government officials around the world.Scott Stringer, a government official from New York City, thinks the city is suitable for the vertical farming.\"Obviously we don't have much land left for us,\" Stringer said, \"But the sky is the limit in Manhattan.\" Despommier admits that there is still a lot of work to do to make vertical farms a reality.\"But I think vertical farming is an idea that can work in a big way.\" he says. \n Question: Why are people advised to eat local? \n Options: (A) Because it means convenience to people.

Distance On level terrain ,without a headwind, a cyclist of average fitness on a touring bike can comfortably cover 60-120km a day.Distances of up to 250km a day are possible, but anything much beyond 120km will require considerable physical tension and not allow many stops to enjoy the places you visit.For many,80-100km a day will be the most suitable distance to aim for, as it will give a sense of achievement and also leave plenty of time for meals and activities. Geography The gradient of the trip will reduce your range.A basic rule is that for every 100 metres of altitude you climb, you should add an extra 15 minutes to your journey time.In hilly or mountainous areas, the easiest routes for cycling are downstream along major rivers, as overall they will be downhill.A long, roundabout route along a river will usually be easier than a short, direct route over a hill or mountain pass.However, it is worth bearing in mind that the most scenic routes often come from hilly terrain.

According to a new survey released by the Pew Research Center, only 40 percent of Americans felt that colleges provided a good value for the cost. At the same time, 86 percent of college graduates still felt it was good for them. There are a number of reasons for such dissatisfaction with college. First, there are plenty of problems with higher education -- poor quality and out-of-control costs are two of the biggest. Second, it is true that college is not for everyone. Plenty of rewarding and important careers do not require college. And due to the slow economy, there may in fact be more graduates than the current job market needs. Besides, anti-college feelings are nothing new. Today, Microsoft's Bill Gates or Apple's Steve Jobs -- both college dropouts -- is often held up as evidence of why all that time sitting in class is better spent elsewhere. However, getting a college education is still a good idea. College graduates earn more, and are more likely to have a job in the first place. According to the statistics last year, the average weekly earnings for someone with some college education but no degrees were $712, compared to $1,038 for a college graduate. That is almost $17,000 over the course of a year and there is an even bigger divide for those with less education. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate was 9.2 percent for those with only some college education and more than 10 percent for those with just a middle school degree, but it was 5.4 percent for college graduates. The economic gaps between college completers and those with less education are getting larger. Although most Americans surveyed by Pew feel doubtful about the value of a college degree, an overwhelming majority of parents Pew surveyed still expect their children to go to college. \"It can be inferred that the increased doubt has not significantly influenced decision making.\" Pew's Taylor says, \"Despite the concern about rising costs and other problems, college remains a universal desire in this country.\" \n Question: Recently many Americans question   _  . \n Options: (A) the value of receiving college education (B) the ability of college graduates (C) the quality of college education (D) the high cost of a college degree", "output": "A", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

Just two or three Ecstasy tablets can permanently destroy brain cells that affect movement and reasoning, according to American research that links the drug to Parkinson's for the first time. A study by a team at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, involving squirrel monkeys and baboons   found that both species suffered permanent damage to key cells, which are lost in Parkinson's, after receiving three low doses of Ecstasy at three-hour periods. The study is particularly important because baboons are one of the best animal models for the human brain. George Ricaurte, who led the research, said that the widespread abuse of drug might have caused severe damage. \"The most troubling result is that young adults using Ecstasy may be increasing their risk of developing Parkinsonism as they get older.\" Alan Leshner, a former director of the US National Institute on Drug Abuse, said, \"This study emphasizes the multi-aspect damage that Ecstasy causes to users. We've long known that repeated use damages brain cells. But this study shows that even very occasional  use can have long-lasting effects on many different brain systems. It sends an important message to young people: don't experiment with your own brain.\" Janet Betts, a mother whose teenage daughter Leah died after a single Ecstasy tablet in 1995, said, \"This comes as no surprise.

While in China, Chen Zhu has announced his plans for a universal health service and reform across health services. Gordon Brown, the UK Prime Minister, has also announced he is planning to make some changes in our health service. The crux of Mr. Brown's proposals are related to giving the NHS (National Health Service) a greater focus on prevention, rather than just curing patients. He is planning to introduce increased screening for common diseases such as heart disease, strokes, and cancer, for example, breast cancer. In Britain there are 200,000 deaths a year from heart attacks and strokes, many of which might have been avoided if the condition had been known about. Initially, the diagnostic   tests will be available for those who are vulnerable, or most likely to have the disease. One example is a plan to offer all men over 65 an ultrasound test to check for problems with the main artery  , a condition which kills 3,000 men a year. The opposition have criticized Mr. Brown's proposals, saying that they are just a trick, and claiming that there is no proper timetable for the changes. They also say that Mr. Brown is reducing the money available for the treatment of certain conditions while putting more money towards testing for them. The NHS was founded in 1948, and is paid for by taxation. The idea is that the rich pay more towards the health service than the poor. However in recent years there has been a great increase in the use of private healthcare, because it's much quicker. NHS waiting lists for operations can be very long, so many people who can afford it choose to pay for medical care themselves. \n Question: All the following statements are true except that   _  . \n Options: (A) all people should pay for their healthcare at the NHS.

It's known later that several officers were also aboard, observing the training exercises. The Kursk is lying on the ocean floor in the Barents Sea. The Russian Navy said that it was listing 30 degrees to port. Other sources reported it was listing as much 60 as degrees. According to a Russian newspaper, when the submarine Kursk failed to make contact with the naval command at the right time later that day, Northern Fleet Commander Admiral Vyachesav Popov ordered rescue ships into the area. It took hours to find the submarine, as it didn't launch  a marking buoy  before sinking.

Now Russian government officially asked Norway for help in recovering of sailors' bodies first of all, and Norway has agreed to offer all help. But Russian insisted that only Russians work inside the submarine Kursk and that the work last for about 10~18 working days. It is expected to recover only 25~35 bodies from the Kursk. It was not until October 25, when a team of Russian divers entered the submarine Kursk, some 350 feet below the surface, that truth became clear.

The driver returned the next spring to see what had become of his cargo. Instead of the skeletons he had expected to find, he saw his oxen, living, fat, and healthy. How had they survived?     The answer lay in a resource that unknowing Americans had trampled   underfoot in their haste to cross the \"Great American Desert\" to reach lands that sometimes proved barren. In the eastern parts of the United States, the preferred grass for forage   was a cultivated plant. It grew well with enough rain, then when cut and stored it would cure and become nourishing hay for winter feed. But in the dry grazing lands of the west, that familiar blue joint grass was often killed by drought. To raise cattle out there seemed risky or even hopeless.      Who could imagine a fairy-tale grass that required no rain and somehow made it possible for cattle to feed themselves all winter? But the surprising western wild grasses did just that. They had wonderfully convenient features that made them superior to the cultivated eastern grasses. Variously known as buffalo grass, not only were they immune to drought, but they were actually preserved by the lack of summer and autumn rains. They were not juicy like the cultivated eastern grasses, but had short, hard stems. And they did not need to be cured in a barn, but dried right where they grew on the ground. When they dried in this way, they remained naturally sweet and nourishing through the winter. Cattle left outdoors to fend for themselves thrived on this hay. And the cattle themselves helped plant the fresh grass year after year, for they trampled the natural seeds firmly into the soil to be watered by the melting snows of winter and the occasional rains of spring. The dry summer air cured them much as storing in a barn cured the cultivated grasses. \n Question: What does the passage mainly discuss? \n Options: (A) Western migration after the Civil War.

The two previous shutdowns -- 1995 and early 1996 -- cost the country $1.4 billion. But what will the shutdown mean for you? Here are 7 ways the government shutdown will affect you. 7. Vacation all I ever wanted: Need to get away? Well, you can't. At least not to national parks. Or to national zoos. Or to national museums. They'll be closed. Were you thinking more along the lines of a trip to France? If you don't already have a passport, you might not get your blue book in time. The last time the government shut down, 200,000 applications for passports went unprocessed. 6. If you drive a car, I'll tax the street: You may be thinking, \"No functioning government, no need to pay taxes.\" Think again. The Man would continue to collect taxes. U.S. bonds would still be issued. And other essential banking functions will go on. 5. Wait a minute, Mr. Postman: You know that whole \"Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night\" thing? Apparently, the U.S. Postal Service works through shutdowns as well. Sorry, you won't catch a break from the junk mail. 4. I want a new drug: Oh, the irony  . Republicans still want to _ delay or otherwise withdraw gradually at Obamacare in exchange for funding the government. But the health care act at the center of this storm would continue its process during a shutdown. That is because its funds aren't dependent on the congressional budget   process. 3. Pass the ammunition  : Not so fast. A shutdown would affect the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Translation: That gun permit you wanted processed won't happen anytime soon if this goes on for a while. 2. Money (that's what I want): Well, if you owned a small business and needed a loan from the government, you would have to wait, depending on how long this lasts. If you were planning to buy a house and needed a federal loan, you would have to wait. 1. I'm proud to be an American: Perhaps the biggest hit would be to the collective psyche  . America is the largest economy in the world and a beacon for how democracy ought to work. A recent CNN Research Corporation found that 51% would blame Republicans for the shutdown. The United States has operated without a budget since 2009 and has avoided a government shutdown with last-minute deals. Not only did the government run out of money on Tuesday, but the nation is set to hit its borrowing limit and potentially default on its debt in mid-October. Together, they serve as a double whammy  . \n Question: When the government's shut down, what can the Americans do? \n Options: (A) Apply for a gun permit. (B) Apply for a new passport.

Do you want to work indoors or outdoors, directly serve people in need or serve people  behind the scenes? These are the typical questions that volunteer service agencies would ask. Every year, thousands of people in the west offer volunteer service. Volunteering greatly strengthens the community because it helps the old, the young, the weak, the sick, the disabled and the injured to overcome difficulties. Volunteers usually help in many different ways. They may give people advice, offer friendship to the young , drive the elderly to church, counsel kids against drugs, work as assistants in schools or nursing homes, raise funds, plant trees, help out in local libraries and do many other things. Volunteering can be a few hours a week or a few hours a month. Anybody who wants to serve people in need can become a volunteer. The art of volunteering is a process of both giving and receiving. Volunteering allows volunteers to meet new people, make new friends and mix with people from all walks of life. Volunteering is an excellent way to experiment,practice and try out new techniques and skills,discover your individual talents and explore career choice.

Together they eat in the finest restaurants, traveling everywhere around the world by luxurious planes and pleasure ships. They are models. Do you envy them? What sort of life are models leading? Is it a wonderful life for a young lady or a young man? A few models are well-known actors or actresses who can make a lot of money only by showing themselves off in commercials. But the majority of them are just curious to see what it is like. They'd like to be models just because they are attracted by what they imagine -- models earn a lot of money and lead a glorious life. This is true for those who are very successful. However, most models find it difficult to get work. Very few can earn enough to live on, and for all models their expenses are high. Their agents claim about 20% of the earnings, and no model will get very far without a clever agent. Besides, they have to buy good clothing. They also have to pay to travel to interviews and reach the places where the work is to be done. Interviews for a model job are known as cattle-markets in the modeling world, and not without a good reason. A top model can choose his or her work, demand and receive high fees and has his or her expenses paid. But for most models, the situation is quite different. And agent or employer inspects each model much as a farmer inspects cattle at a market. Intelligence, qualifications and personal characteristics count for little against good looks and tight figures. For all except the very few lucky ones, the life of a model is a continual search for work, trying to sell himself or herself in the face of fierce competition and, sometimes, not particularly moral standards on the part of some employers. Immigration officials at airport look suspiciously at a girl whose passport shows her occupation as \"Model\", and these are men and women of considerable experience of the world. It comes no surprise to find that some models prefer to put \"Secretary\" or \"Businessman\" as their jobs in their passports. Modeling is a changeable world with great rewards for a tiny minority but not for the majority. \n Question: For models, their good looks and tight figures are   _  , compared with their intelligence and qualifications. \n Options: (A) more important (B) less needed (C) less essential (D) more looked down upon", "output": "A", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

That saying holds true not only for you and me, but also for some of the most powerful and influential people in the world, such as the presidents of the United States. But how do American presidents spend their vacation time? Let's take a look! Franklin D. Roosevelt, considered one of the greatest presidents in American history, had limited vacation options because of his polio . He began visiting Warm Springs, Georgia in 1924 for its curative waters and later built a 2,000 acre polio treatment center nearby. He liked to cruise the Potomacon his yacht  and three times as president returned to his beloved Canadian island of Campobello, with which he fell in love as a kid. Former President Bill Clinton, however, was never much good at vacationing. His staff had to practically force him to go on vacation his first year in office; his idea of relaxing was reading four good books simultaneously  while enjoying a cigar (chewed, not smoked). He could also lose himself in a game of golf, where his somewhat flexible interpretation of the rules could at times drive his partners crazy. Obama's predecessor  also knows how to relax. Fishing is in the Bush family DNA: for blue sharks off the coast of Maine or anything with fins, almost anywhere else. George W. Bush also relaxed as president by jogging and clearing brush on his Texas ranch. Since leaving office, he has become an active mountain biker and, more recently, has taken up painting. Obama tends to take a winter break in Hawaii, where he was born and raised, and a summer vacation in Martha's Vineyard, off the southern coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. In between, he plays basketball every couple of weeks and has been known to do some skeet shooting at Camp David. Obama's favorite pastime, no matter the location, has become easy to spot: golf. \n Question: What's the passage mainly about? \n Options: (A) US presidents on holiday.

This new finding suggests that insects may employ some of the same methods that birds use for traveling long distances. Scientists have long thought that insects were simply at the mercy of the wind. Fascinating as their skills of flight are, migrating behavior has been difficult to study in   insects because many long distant trips happen thousands of feet above ground. Only recently have scientists developed technologies that can detect   such little creatures at such great heights. To their surprise, though, the insects weren't passive travelers on the winds. In autumn, for example, most light winds blew from the east, but the insects somehow sought out ones that carried them south and they positioned themselves to navigate directly to their wintering homes. Even in the spring, when most winds flowed northward, the insects didn't always go with the flow. If breezes weren't blowing in the exact direction they wanted to go, the insects changed their body positions to compensate  . Many migrating birds do the same thing. The study also found, butterflies and moths actively flew within the air streams that pushed them along. By adding flight speeds to wind speeds, the scientists calculated that butterflies and moths can travel as fast as 100 kilometers an hour. The findings may have real-world applications. With climate warming, migrating insects are growing in number. Knowing how and when these pests move could help when farmers decide when to spray their crops. \n Question: What's the main idea of the text? \n Options: (A) Insects migrate with the seasons.

Our political leaders hammered home the point. Franklin Roosevelt held that a country of homeowners was \"unconquerable.\" Homeownership could even save babies, save children, save families and save America. A house with a lawn and a fence wasn't just a nice place to live in or a risk-free investment; it was a way to transform a nation. No wonder leaders of all political types wanted to spend more than $100 billion a year on subsidies and tax breaks to encourage people to buy. But the dark side of homeownership is now all too apparent: Indeed, easy lending stimulated by the cult of homeownership may have caused the financial crisis. Housing remains a drag on the economy. Existing-home sales in April dropped 27% from the prior month, worsening fears of a double-drop. And all that is just the obvious tale of a housing bubble and what happened when it popped. _  For the better part of a century, politics, industry and culture lined up to create a fetish of the idea of buying a house. Homeownership has done plenty of good over the decades; it has provided stability to tens of millions of families. Yet by idealizing the act of buying a home, we have ignored the downsides. In the bubble years, lending standards slipped dramatically, allowing many Americans to put far too much of their income into paying for their housing. And we ignored longer-term phenomena too. Homeownership contributed to the hollowing out of cities and kept renters out of the best neighborhoods. It fed America's overuse of energy and oil. It made it more difficult for those who had lost a job to find another. Perhaps worst of all, it helped us become casually self-deceiving: By telling ourselves that homeownership was a pathway to wealth and stable communities and better test scores, we avoided dealing with these frightening issues head-on. Now, as the U.S. recovers from the biggest housing bust  since the Great Depression, it is time to rethink how realistic our expectations of homeownership are--and how much money we want to spend chasing them. Many argue that homeownership should not be a goal pursued at all costs. \n Question: Political leaders wanted to spend money encouraging people to buy houses because   _  . \n Options: (A) owning a home was undoubtedly good (B) homeownership was unconquerable (C) houses could save families and America (D) homeownership could shape a country", "output": "D", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

Making decisions on your own is hard enough, but when other people get involved and try to pressure you one way or another it can be even harder. People who are your age, like your classmates, are called peers. When they try to influence how you act, to get you to do something, it's called peer pressure. Peers can have a positive influence on each other. Maybe another student in your science class taught you an easy way to remember the planets in the solar system. Maybe you got others excited about your new favorite book, and now everyone's reading it. These are examples of how peers positively influence each other. Sometimes peers influence each other in negative ways. For example, a few kids in school might try to get you to cut class with them; your soccer friend might try to convince you to be mean to another player and never pass him the ball. It is tough to be the only one who says \"no\" to peer pressure, but you can do it.

When she tried to walk, her legs twisted. After the operation, she adapted quickly. \"From day one,I basically jumped up and wanted to do everything,'' she says. Prostheses allowed her to move around upright. But too slowly to keep up with her friends. Brittany's solution was to take the legs off and walk on her knees something she still does when safety and comfort permit. She has been rarely discouraged. Other children laughed at her through the years,especially in junior high school,but she says the challenge only made her stronger. Now she's trying to convince her coaches to let her remove the prostheses and be a flyer. The cheerleader who's thrown in the air and caught by her teammates. Brittany doesn't think her problems put her at a disadvantage. \"My disability was the first thing I had to get through., and that's going to prepare me for the future. \"she says. \"It's all just a test:If someone throws you a difficult problem,what are you going to do?\" \n Question: What was the coaches' first attitude towards Brittany's dream? \n Options: (A) Supportive (B) Enthusiastic (C) Optimistic (D) Doubtful", "output": "D", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

But did you know that there are ways to make your brain healthier and smarter? Studies show that when the brain is _ to do something new, it creates new neural pathways . The more pathways you have, the faster you can think and the better memory you will have. Ten steps toward a smarter brain Limit your TV time Watching an average TV show requires very little brain power and brings the same result as neglecting physical exercise. Your brain will become weak just as your muscles do. If you watch TV, choose something educational and informative. Travel Traveling to a new country forces you to see and do things in a new way, providing stimulation  to the brain. Learn a new language Acquiring a new language involves different learning methods. Learning a language sharpens your brain and helps prevent memory problems in later years. Master a new subject Each week, select an animal, a bird or a fish, and read everything you can about it. Stretch  your brain as you become an expert on the subject. Use your non-dominant hand If you are right-handed, use your left hand for everyday activities, or use your right hand if you are left-handed. Doing familiar things in a new way will cause your brain to create new neural networks. Read often As you read, take the time to look up people or places that aren't familiar. Reading expands your vocabulary if you search for words and definitionsthat you don't know. Do puzzles According to the Mayo Clinic, doing sudoku and crossword puzzles keeps the brain sharp into your senior years.

But everything changes when he bumps into an old friend on the street,who invites him to attend a seminar about the power of the word \"yes\".At the seminar,the speaker preaches that if you say \"yes\" to every opportunity,you'll have a much happier and more fulfilled life than if you let opportunities pass you by.

She never married and she died from illness when she was only 41. However, people all over the world remember her. Why? It is because Jane Austen is the author of some of the best-loved novels in the English language. These novels include Emma, Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility and Persuasion. Jane completed her last novel Persuasion in 1816, but it was not published until after her death. Persuasion is partly based on Jane's naval brother. Anne, the daughter of Sir Walter Elliot, falls in love with Captain Wentworth, a person of a lower social position. But she breaks off the engagement when persuaded by her friend Lady Russell that such a match is unworthy. The breakup produces in Anne a deep and long-lasting regret. Eight years later, Wentworth returns from sea a rich and successful captain. He finds Anne's family on the edge of financial ruin. Anne and the captain rediscover their love and get married. Jane Austen once compared her writing to painting on a little bit of ivory , two inches square. Readers of Persuasion will see that neither her skill of delicate, ironic  observations on social custom, love, and marriage nor her ability to apply a sharp focus to English manners and morals has abandoned her in her final finished work. Persuasion has produced three film adaptations: a 1995 version starring Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, a 2007 TV miniseries with Sally Hawkins and Rupert Penry-Jones, and a 1971 miniseries with Ann Firbank and Bryan Marshall. People who are interested in Jane Austen can still visit many of the places she visited and lived. These places include the village of Steventon, although her family house is now gone. Many of the places Jane visited in Bath are still there. You can visit Jane Austen's home in Chawton, where she did her best writing, and Winchester, where she died. \n Question: What is the theme of Persuasion? \n Options: (A) Never regret what you've chosen.

Now it has grown to include almost l,500 sites across the U.

One module will feature \"Problem Solving on Planet ZAK\". It will challenge children by creating a world of science fiction. Imitating a \"crash\" onto a planet, children will be asked to figure out ways to stay safe, find food and to \"rebuild\" their spacecraft, using a variety of common objects.      Another module will be \"Saving Sludge City\" which will have children find ways to create a cleaner and eco-friendly city.     \"Imagination Point: Ride Physics\" asks children to work as interns   in the world's newest and largest theme park called \"Imagination Point\".

Oh, he wasn't unreasonable or cruel; he simply felt that no matter what your best was, you should achieve it. As luck would have it, I met him again as my eighth grade math teacher.

I can't do it.!\" \"Perhaps you don't know the answer,\" he would say quietly. \"Do you think we might figure it out together? How do you know what you can do until you try?\" Mr. Myrus lived around the corner, and I would often stop by to talk while he worked in his wood shop. In this room of sawdust, wood chips, and the smoke from the woodburning stove, I felt respected and valued as a person.

The tradition of giving cash gifts of \"lucky money\" (\"hong bao\" in Chinese) goes back centuries and can be particularly profitable for the young and the unmarried. As the country increasingly adopts online business and e-commerce models, tradition is taking a back seat to convenience as more and more lucky money receivers prefer to receive their money via electronic means. A recent study conducted by Shanghai-based Avanti Rhesearch Partner showed that 58% of respondents   preferred their hong bao directly deposited into their accounts.       The country is becoming increasingly connected --- over 90% of 18 to 30 year olds in China own an Internet-connected smart phone, according to a Global Times survey published last year.       Of course, China's Internet giants have not been slow to capitalize on this trend, with Shenzhen-based Tencent last week launching their \"New Year Red Envelope\" app  , an add-on to its popular WeChat messaging service. The company's over 600 million WeChat users can send each other lucky money, provided both the sender and receiver have signed up to the company's in-app payment service.      \"I am really happy that I can use a new and fashionable way to send my holiday greetings to my family and friends, especially for people who have kids but live far away from us.\" said Mr. Cheng, a user of the service.      The service reportedly banked 18 million RMB ($2.9 million) worth of transfers   in its first 24 hours, according to a report in the Beijing Youth Daily newspaper.      While Tencent's rival Alibaba also has a similar service, called Hong Bao, which launched last year, WeChat's app allows users to randomly distribute up to 200 yuan ($33) within a group of friends, adding a fun element of unpredictability to the process.      Some analysts believe that linking the payments to WeChat's in-app payment service could be a game-changer, as it simplifies the process of paying for micro dealings, potentially making users more likely to make in-app purchases in the future.       \"The tradition of giving red packets is a symbolic gesture,\" said Steve Wang, Chief Economist, Reorient Group. \"It's a new way to get people more comfortable dealing with money online, to expand their user base.

Then why use rats for such an important job? In the past, dogs have been used to find bombs. Rats have a good sense of smell and can respond to orders, just like dogs do. But rats are much lighter than dogs. They stand less of a chance of setting off the mines, which explode under a certain amount of weight. What's more, the best rats are cheaper to keep than dogs. It costs about the same amount of money to take care of one dog as it does 70 rats. The rats have already been used in Tanzania, an African country with many land mines. Luisa Fernanda Mendez and her team in Colombia are training the even lighter Wistar rats. These are the white rats with red eyes that scientists often use in laboratory experiments. \" _ even train their babies to perform their jobs, which saves us a lot of time, \" Mendez said. Colombia has the second-highest rate  of deaths from land mine accidents in the world. Last year, land mines killed 695 people -- 56 of whom were children. A criminal group called the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, as well as other organizations, have placed the mines. FARC are strongly against Colombia's government. The group has placed mines all around its own bases and in many places in the countryside. In the past, the Colombian government hired peasants and poor farmers to find mines. Many of them died trying to find the well-hidden bombs. Colombian police official Erick Guzman hopes the team of rats can come to the rescue . \"These rats will be a great help,\" he said. \n Question: How do rats help to find land mines? \n Options: (A) By their special sight.

Chinese people may celebrate the Chinese New Year in slightly different ways but their wishes are almost the same; they want their family members and friends to be healthy and lucky during next year. Chinese New Year Celebration usually lasts for 15 days. Celebratory activities include Chinese New Feast, firecrackers, giving lucky money to children, the New Year bell ringing and Chinese New Year Greetings. Most of Chinese people will stop the celebrating in their home on the 7th day of New Year because the national holiday usually ends around that day, however celebrations in public areas can last until the 15th day of New Year. It is the money given to kids from their parents and grandparents as New Year gift. The money is believed to bring good luck, ward off monsters; hence the name \"lucky money\". Parents and grandparents first put money in small, especially-made red envelopes and give the red envelopes to their kids after the New Year's Feast or when they come to visit them on the New Year. They choose to put the money in red envelopes because Chinese people think red is a lucky color. They want to give their children both lucky money and lucky color. \n Question: What can we learn from the Paragragh 1? \n Options: (A) Chinese New Year Celebration is one of the most important celebrations in China (B) Chinese New Year Celebration can bring luck to them during the next year (C) Some different celebrations still exist (D) Kids can get their lucky money during the Chinese New Year Celebration", "output": "C", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

Monday, 1 September On my first day I was looking around for a locker to put my books in. However, here all the students keep all of their books at their desks--we stay in the same classroom because apparently we don't have to go from class to class--teachers come to us! Today we selected teacher assistants for each subject. Their duties are to collect homework, make announcements, and do other stuff for the teacher and the students. It's kind of a big deal here!

I think Chinese students work too much! I have to do my homework when I get back home. I don't even have time to watch TV or surf the Internet like before.

Rich was not only not Chinese and he was a few years younger than I was.And unfortunately,he looked much younger with his curly red hair,smooth pale skin,and the splash of orange freckles  across his nose.He was a bit on the short side,compactly built.In his dark business suits,he looked nice but easily forgettable,which was why I didn't notice him the first year we worked together at the firm.But my mother noticed everything. \"So what do you think of Rich?\"I finally asked,holding my breath. She tossed the eggplant in the hot oil,angry hissing sound.\"So many spots on his face,\"she said. \"They are freckles.Freckles are good luck.\"I said a bit too heatedly in trying to raise my voice above the noise of the kitchen. \"Oh?\"She said innocently. \"Yes,the more spots the better.\" She considered this a moment and then smiled and spoke in Chinese:\"When you were young,you got the chicken pox.So many spots,you had to stay home for ten days.So lucky,you thought.\" I couldn't save Rich in the kitchen.And I couldn't save him later at the dinner table. When I offered Rich a fork,he insisted on using the slippery ivory chopsticks.Halfway between his plate and his open mouth,a large chunk of redcooked eggplant fell on his brand new white shirt. And then he helped himself to big portions of the shrimp and snow peas,not realizing he should have taken only a polite spoonful. He declined the new greens,the tender and expensive leaves of bean plants.He thought he was being polite by refusing seconds,when he should have followed my father's example,who made a big show of taking small portions of seconds,thirds and even fourths,always saying he couldn't resist another bite and then groaning he was so full he thought he would burst. But the worst was when Rich criticized my mother's cooking and he didn't even know what he had done.As is the Chinese cook's custom,my mother always made modest remarks about her own cooking.That night she chose to direct it toward her famous steamed pork and preserved vegetable dish,which she always served with special pride. \"Ai!This dish not salty enough,no flavor,\"she complained,after tasting a small bite. This was our family's cue to eat more and proclaim it the best she had ever made.But before we could do so,Rich said,\"You know,all it needs is a little soy sauce.\"And he proceeded to pour a riverful of the salty black stuff on the china plate,right before my mother's horrified eyes. And even though I was hoping throughout the dinner that my mother would somehow see Rich's kindness,his sense of humor and boyish charm.I knew he had failed miserably in her eyes. Rich obviously had a different opinion on how the evening had gone.When we got home,I was still shuddering, _ remembering how Rich had firmly shaken both my parents'hands with that same easy familiarity he used with nervous new clients.\"Linda,Tim,\"he said,\"we'll see you again.\"My parents'names are Lindo and Tin Jong,and nobody except a few older family friends ever calls them by their first names. \"What did she say when you told her?\"I knew he was referring to our getting married. \"I never had a chance,\"I said,which was true.How could I have told my mother I was getting married,when at every possible moment we were alone,she seemed to remark on how pale and ill he looked.

If you are interested only in your regular occupation, you are alive only to that extent.So far as other things are concerned----poetry and prose, music, pictures, sports unselfish friendships, politics, international affairs----you are dead. On the contrary, it is true that every time you acquire a new interest----even more, a new accomplishment----you increase your power of life.No one who is deeply interested in different kinds of subjects can remain unhappy.The real is the person who has lost interest. Bacon said that a man dies as often as he loses a friend.But we gain new life by contacts with new friends, and new ideas and thoughts, too.Where your thoughts are, there will be your life also.If your thoughts are limited only to your business, only to your physical welfare, only to your narrow circle of the town in which you live, then you live in a narrow restricted   life.But if you are interested in the characters of a good novel, then you are living with those highly interested people; if you listen intently to fine music, you are always away from immediate surroundings and living in a world of passion and imagination. To be or not to be ---- to live intensely and richly, or merely to exist, that depends on ourselves.Let us widen and intensify our relations.While we live, let us live. \n Question: What does the author mainly want to do by this passage? \n Options: (A) Argue against an idea.

The victims, a man and a woman were found dead on a road outside a plant in Nancai Industrial Park in Shunyi District at 9 p.m. Sunday. The northern district of Miyun recorded rainfall of 243 mm in 22 hours before 6 a.m. Monday, said Wei Jianmin, chief forecaster of the Beijing Observatory  . He said the rain is important to fill up Beijing's important water source of the Miyun Reservoir  , which has received 17 million cubic meters of water during the rain so far. Although the rain had little effect on traffic Monday, it caused a disorder in the city's busy air traffic. According to Beijing Capital International Airport's website, 329 flights were called off due to the rainstorm. Meanwhile, traffic on a rail link between Beijing and Chengde City in neighboring Hebei province was put off after several sections of the track were flooded in rainwater Sunday night. Workers are still rushing to clear the railway. The city acted Sunday evening to take measures against rainstorm-caused disasters. More than 6,000 people living in the hilly regions of Miyun and Pinggu districts in Beijing's outskirts   were brought to safe grounds Sunday evening before floods threatened more than 10 villages and caused four landslides there.

The National Governors Association (NGA) and the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) led the effort. The United States, unlike other nations, has never had the same school standards across the country. What is the reason? Education is not discussed in the Constitution. That document limits the responsibilities of the federal government. Other responsibilities, like education, fall to each state. Local control of education probably was a good idea two hundred years ago. People stayed in the same place and schools knew what students needed to learn. But today, people move to different cities. And some people work at jobs that did not exist even twenty years ago. Many American educators say that getting a good education should not depend on where you live. They say that some states have lowered their standards in order to increase student scores on tests required by the No Child Left behind Act. Kara Schlosser is communications director for the CCSSO. She says the new standards clearly state what a student should be able to do to be successful in college and work. Forty--eight states have already shown approval for the standards. Two states refuse to accept the idea. Critics say that working toward the same standards in every state will not guarantee excellence for all. Some educators in Massachusetts say adopting the national standards will hurt their students because the state standards are even higher. Others say the change will be too costly, requiring new textbooks and different kinds of training for teachers. Still others fear federal control. Supporters say the standards are goals and do not tell states or teachers how to teach. They also say the federal government is not forcing acceptance. However, approving the standards will help states qualify   for some federal grant money. \n Question: What would be the best title for the passage? \n Options: (A) Local Control of Education Standards out of Date (B) American National Education Standards under Consideration (C) Education Standards in Each State--Good or Bad.

Sometimes it is helpful if you know what common proverbs mean. Here are a few examples: Once bitten, twice shy. If a dog bites me, I shall be twice as careful in future when I see it. This proverb is also used to apply to many things and not only to dogs. If you have been cheated at a shop, you will not go to the same shop again. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. If I am a hunter, trying to catch birds, it is better to catch one bird than to see two birds in a bush but not be able to catch them. Thus this means that what you have already got is better than the chance of being able to get something bigger in the future. Too many cooks spoil the broth(soup). When too many people do something together, they get in each other's way and cannot do a good job. To pour oil on troubled waters Is to try to calm things down. Oil is lighter than water.

Isn't it tempting to lie just a little, to claim on the form that your diploma  represents a Harvard degree? Or that you finished an extra couple of years back at State University? More and more people are turning to an utter deception   like this to land their first job or to move head in their careers. For personnel officers, like most Americans, value degrees from famous schools. A job applicant may have a good education anyway, but he or she assumes that chances of being hired are better with a diploma from a well-known university. Registrars at most well-known colleges say that they deal with dishonest claims like these at the rate of about one per week. Personnel officers do check up on degrees listed on application forms. If it turns out that an applicant is lying, most colleges are unwilling to accuse the applicant directly. One lvy League school refers to them as \"special cases\", One well-known West Coast school, in perhaps the most delicate phrase of all, says these claims are made by \"no such people\". To avoid complete lies, some job seekers claim that they \"attended\" or \"were associated with\" a college or university. After careful checking, a personnel officer may discover that \"attending\" means being dismissed after one semester. It may be that \"being as sociated with\" a college means that the job-seeker visited his younger brother for a football weekend. One school that keeps records of false claims says that the practice dates back at least to the turn of  the century--that's when they began keeping records, anyhow. If you don't want to lie or even stretch the truth, there are companies that will sell you a fake diploma.

But procrastination does have consequences.When your procrastination leaves you feeling discouraged, it is time to take action, and one of the best ways to get rid of it is to make an un-schedule. An un-schedule is a weekly calendar of all the ways in which your time is already accounted for.You consider not only your timed commitments such as classes and meetings, but also your untimed activities such as meals, exercise, time with friends, and the like.Once you have made your un-schedule, you may be able to see your time is often filled with more activities than you realize, for instance, that you really don't have five hours to spend writing on the night before your paper is due.Procrastinators' views of time tend to be unrealistic, and the un-schedule can help you outline a realistic plan.By planning accordingly, you will not only get a better night's sleep, you may also end up with a better paper. The un-schedule might also be a good way to get started on a larger project, such as a term paper or an honors paper.You may think that you have \"all semester\" to get the writing done, but if you really map out how much time you have available to write on a daily and weekly basis, you will see that you need to get started sooner, rather than later.In addition, the un-schedule may reveal especially busy weeks or months, which will help you budget time for long-term projects. Perhaps most importantly, the un-schedule can help you examine how you spend your time.You may be surprised at how much time you spend watching television, and decide to make a change.It's especially important that you build time for fun activities into your un-schedule.Otherwise, you will procrastinate in order to steal time for relaxation. You can also use the un-schedule to record your progress towards your goal.Reward yourself for your small successes.Seeing what you've achieved will help reinforce the productive behavior, and you will feel more motivated in the following process. As you explore ways to conquer procrastination, don't expect overnight transformation.You developed the habit over a long time; you aren't going to stop magically.But you can change the behavior, bit by bit.If you start to make an un-schedule now, you will eventually develop new habits. \n Question: Which of the following statements best reflects an un-schedule? \n Options: (A) \"Now I have more time for fun.\" (B) \"I can start my big project later.\" (C) \"I'll treat myself to a movie for my progress.\" (D) \"I'm going to have more time to finish my paper.\"", "output": "C", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

There is one spot, near Japan, where the sea is nearly 11 kilometers deep! The highest mountain in the world is about 9 kilometers high. If that mountain were put into the sea at that place, there would be 2 kilometers of water above it! The sea is salty. Rivers, which flow into the sea, carry salt from the land into the sea. Some parts of the sea are more salty than other parts. There is one sea, called the Dead Sea, which is very salty. It is so salty that swimmers can't sink! Fish can't live in the Dead Sea! The sea can be very cold. Divers, who go deep down in the sea, know this. On the top the water may be warm. When the diver goes downwards, the sea becomes colder and colder. Another thing happens. When the diver goes deeper, the water above presses down on him. It squeezes him. Then the diver has to wear clothes made of metal. But he cannot go very deep.

The immigrants  can learn the language, English, to keep this country united, but it is unnecessary to change their culture for an American way of life. I believe that recent immigrants should learn English in order to live in the country. They should learn the \"public language\". If they don't learn English, they won't be able to communicate and do what they want. For example, my mother's friend came to the United States from Ecuador three years ago. She doesn't speak English. One day, her daughter, Anita, couldn't breathe. Anita didn't know what was going on, but she told her mother to call an ambulance. When her mother called the hospital, she couldn't communicate. The operator couldn't understand what Anita's mother was saying. Fortunately, her mother's sister arrived and called the ambulance. The doctor told her sister that if she hadn't arrived at the hospital on time, Anita could have died. A pill had gotten stuck in her throat. Immigrants should learn English to speak with the public, but they can also keep their language at home. The children of immigrants should learn how to speak their parents' language. It is very important to communicate with our relatives and family. If we learn English only and forget our private \"language\", we won't be able to communicate with our parents. For example, Florence, my co-worker, speaks English only. Her mother didn't teach her Spanish (her mother's mother language). Now, Florence can't communicate with her grandparents or other relatives in Puerto Rico. She has lost her mother's mother language, tradition and culture. Immigrants have the freedom to keep their culture and values. Immigrants should know where they come from and what their family's culture is. In this way, they can transmit it to future generations. In conclusion, immigrants should learn English in order to communicate with the public and to keep the country united, but they shouldn't give up their own culture. \n Question: Who played the most important part in calling an ambulance fro Anita? \n Options: (A) Anita's aunt.

But don't worry, they're not mad, it's all part of a biennial fund-raising event called Red Nose Day. Organized by the charity Comic Relief, founded in 1985 by two British comedians, the aim of the event is to raise money to fight poverty and injustice in the UK and Africa. Celebrities and public figures support the event by making appearances on comic TV shows broadcast by the BBC. This year, for example, UK Prime Minister David Cameron appeared in a music video by One Direction, which the band produced for the event. But Britons don't just raise money for charitable causes on one day a year, they do it all year round. One way of doing so is by shopping in charity shops. These small, inconspicuous shops sell clothes, books and household goods just like any other shop. But there's one big difference--it's all secondhand. There are nearly 10,000 charity shops in the UK, according to the Charity Retail Association. Their business model is simple: Anybody who has things they don't want anymore can donate them to a charity shop, where they are checked for damage, cleaned and priced. Most items go back on sale at a small part of their original price and the money that is made by selling them is used for a charitable cause. The idea of buying used clothes may sound off-putting, but for shoppers who have less spending money, such as the elderly or those in low-paying jobs, it has been a welcome option for years. Now, \"thrifting\"--shopping at charity shops-- is also becoming popular with young people looking for alternative fashion. \"I love shopping at thrift stores. You can find very unique clothes for a very cheap price. It doesn't bother me that other people may have worn them, I simply wash them before I wear them,\" said Anne Marie, a 19-year-old Internet user from the US, in a comment on a Yahoo forum. So next time you spot a charity shop, why not go inside? Who knows, you might find a lovely dress for just a few pounds. Even better, you can enjoy wearing it in the knowledge that your money helped a good cause. \n Question: What do famous people in Britain do in support of the Red Nose Day event? \n Options: (A) Appear on comic TV shows.

One theory centers on the two halves of the brain. For example, the left half and the right half, each of which functions differently. Medical science believes that the left half of the brain dominates over the right half. The foundation of this theory is the fact that nerves from the brain cross over at neck-level to the opposite side of the body, and nerves from the other side of the brain reciprocate  . The end result is that the opposite sides of the body are controlled by the opposite sides of the brain. The dominant left half of the brain, which kindly supplies the right half of the body, theoretically makes it more skillful in reading, writing, speaking, and working, and makes most people right-handed. Lefties, however, whose right half of the brain dominates, work best with the left side of their bodies. Theory number two focuses on the _ nature of the body. Examples of the asymmetry, which flows from head to toe, are that the right side of our faces differs slightly from the left, that our legs differ in strength, or that our feet vary in size. One aspect of this asymmetry is that for most people the right hand is stronger than the left. There is no doubt that all exist in a \"right-handed society\", which produces most basics, including scissors, doorknobs, locks, screwdrivers, automobiles, buttons on clothing, and musical instruments for the 96%.

For many years I had wanted to take my family on the train. We all had been to Chicago four years ago, and the kids loved it. Chicago is one of my favorite cities, too, so the thought struck me again last fall to ride the train to Chicago. Of course, flying would have been faster. But I don't think flying is easier, especially these days, with all the security and waiting in lines at airports. Though we were tired in the middle of the night, the kids got on the train with the _ of this adventure. \"We're moving,\" my son William shouted happily with big eyes as the train began to pull away from the Hutchinson station. I removed my shoes and lay down to try to finish my night's sleep. The sleeper car would have better enabled that, but the ordinary train seats were not too bad. An airline flight is a more miserable experience for me: not enough room, two hours of pain with my knees almost touching my chin, the hard seatback in front cracking my kneecaps   with every move of the body planted in front of me. On the train I could almost outstretch all of my 6-foot-2-plus body in the generous legroom. The journey didn't feel at all as long as it was. We all found the train ride a joy. The car ride would have felt every minute of 13 hours. But on the train you are free to walk around, sit in the observation carriage for a while and enjoy the scenery out the windows, have a nice meal in the dining car, read a book, or play a board game. In short, the train is all about enjoying the trip, which isn't something I do so much when traveling by airline or by car, when the trip seems more of a mission   to get there than an experience to enjoy along the way.

It is accepted in the marketing industry,and confirmed by a number of researches,that customers receiving good service will promote business by telling up to 12 other people;those treated badly will tell their tales of woe to up to 20 people.Interestingly,80 percent of people who feel their complaints are handled fairly will stay loyal. New challenges for customer care have come when people can obtain goods and services through telephone call centers and the Internet.For example,many companies now have to invest a lot of money in information technology and staff training in order to cope with the \"phone rage\"--caused by delays in answering calls,being cut off in mid-conversation or left waiting for long periods. \"Many people do not like talking to machines,\"says Dr.Storey,Senior Lecturer in Marketing at City University Business School.\"Banks,for example,encourage staff at call centers to use customer data to establish instant and good relationship with them.The aim is to make the customer feel they know you and that you can trust them--the sort of comfortable feelings people have during face-to-face chats with their local branch manager.\" Recommended ways of creating customer delight include:under-promising and over-delivering (saying that a repair will be carried out within five hours,but getting it done within two );replacing a faulty product immediately;throwing in a gift voucher as an unexpected \"thank you\" to regular customers;and always returning calls,even when they are complaints. Aiming for customer delight is all very well,but if services do not reach the high level promised,disappointment or worse will be the result.This can be eased by offering an apology and an explanation of why the service did not meet usual standards with empathy (for example,\"I know how you must feel\"),and possible solutions (replacement,compensation or whatever fairness suggests best meets the case). Airlines face some of the toughest challenges over customer care.Fierce competition has convinced them that delighting passengers is an important marketing tool,while there is great potential for customer anger over delays caused by weather,unclaimed luggage and technical problems. For British Airways staff,a winning telephone style is considered vital in handling the large volume of calls about bookings and flight times.They are trained to answer quickly,with their name,job title and a \"we are here to help\" attitude.The company has invested heavily in information technology to make sure that infomation is available instantly on screen. British Airways also says its customer care policies are applied within the company and staff are taught to regard each other as customers requiring the highest standards of service. Customer care is obviously here to stay and it would be a foolish company that used slogans such as \"we do as we please\".On the other hand,the more customers are promised,the greater the risk of disappointment. \n Question: What does the writer recommend to create customer delight? \n Options: (A) Calling customers regularly.

In fact, according to some estimates, over 30% of all adults in the world drink coffee at least once a day on the average.  Coffee contains a kind of drug called caffeine. Caffeine is a chemical that stimulates   the nerves of the body. Drinking coffee tends to make people a little bit more awake--at least for a short time--because of this stimulating effect on the nervous system. A cup of coffee has, on the average, about 3% caffeine in it. One story of the discovery of the coffee plant relates to this effect of caffeine. According to the story, coffee was discovered in East Africa. The story says that coffee was first found by a goat farmer named Kaldi. This was about the year 850. Kaldi was leading his animals through the mountains and the goats were stopping repeatedly to eat the plants near the path. Suddenly, some of the goats started jumping up and down in a very strange way. Kaldi figured out that the goats were acting this way because of the plants they were eating. Kaldi himself tried eating some of the green beans   that the goats had been eating. He, too, felt the stimulating effect of the beans.   Kaldi wanted to prove what had happened, so he picked some of the beans and took them back to the village, where he told his story. The green bean got the name \"Kaffa\" and later \"coffee\" because the beans were discovered in a place called Kaffa in Africa. Then for years, people used to eat a few of the green Kaffa beans when they were in the mountains and needed extra energy to do their work. It was later found that the coffee beans could be picked and then dried until they turned brown, and then they could be stored. If the beans were dried and stored, they could be used at any time. \n Question: What is the purpose of drinking coffee? \n Options: (A) To become more awake. (B) To become more healthy.

Newton thought he had already worked out that problem, but he could not find the papers on which he had done it. He told Halley that the orbit of a comet had the shape of an ellipse . Now Halley set to work. He figured out(,)the orbits of some of the comets that had been observed by scientists. He made a surprising discovery. The comets that had appeared in the years 1531, 1607, and 1682 all had the same orbit. Yet their appearance had been 75 to 76 years apart. This seemed very strange to Halley. Three different comets followed the same orbit. The more Halley thought about it, the more he thought that there had not been three different comets as people thought. He decided that they had simply seen the same comet three times. The comet had gone away and had come back again. It was an astonishing idea! Halley felt certain to make a prediction of what would happen in the future. He decided that this would appear in the year 1758. There were 53 years to go before Halley's prediction could be tested.

However, in the West,it is common for the family to sit down and watch a movie together.Tim Bridges, from London,says:\"I love it at Christmas when I sit down and watch a movie with my family.\" All family films contain similar messages about being honest, remaining positive and learning there is more to life than money.According to the American movie reviewer,Dave Johnson, this is because \"When parents watch a movie,they want their children to be learning good values\". Just like when the alien in Spielberg's E.T.phones home to make contact with his family, Chow will hope Chinese audiences are tuned in and ready to receive his family movie message. \n Question: What is the family film,according to the passage? \n Options: (A) A kind of film that is about history.

His hat was always the same kind of a cowboy hat- large black hat of heavy wool. He wore his hat full and high. I think he wanted to look taller than he really was. Mama was proud of the way he looked when he wore his hat and his best clothes. But in some way she got the idea that papa would lose his hair if he kept wearing a heavy wool cowboy hat in the hot weather. She began to talk about his hats. \"Papa,\" she said one day, \"why don't you get a nice cool straw hat? That heavy wool cowboy hat may cause losing hair!\" Papa laughed at her and explained that the horses wouldn't recognize him if he changed the hat. But she didn't believe him. Mama talked and talked about the hat all summer long. At last papa answered, a little angry, \"It would not the cowboy hat but a wife's talking about the hat that makes me lose my hair.\" Mama had a very serious look on her face. She went straight out and later came home with a straw hat. It was a bad year for ranger and we didn't have much money. She thought that if she spent the money for a straw hat, papa would wear it. When papa saw the hat, his face got red. Without a word, he pulled the straw hat down over his head until it hid his eyes and went on to train the horses. He was a good ranger and gentle to his horses. But as papa got close to the horses this time, they jumped high into the air, raising their front feet. All of them ran around in the rounded field and then raced toward the barn. Papa began to shout \"Woo boys. Steady boys, steady.\" But there was nothing equal to. Papa walked back straight to the stove in the kitchen, pushed the straw hat deep down into the fire then turned to mama, in a way that even frightened me. \"Now listen to me, mama. Understand this I will never wear a straw hat or any other kind of hat my horses do not like.\" Then he put on his wool cowboy hat and walked out of the house. I never heard mama talk any more about hats. Perhaps, that is why when papa died many years later, there was a round spot on the top of his head where there was no hair. \n Question: According to the passage, a ranger is   _  . \n Options: (A) a person wearing a woolen hat (B) a position requiring clean clothes (C) a person training horses for some purpose (D) a person riding a carriage with horses", "output": "C", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

The root of being anxious is our unwillingness to accept life as being different, in any way, from our expectation.Very simply, we want things to be a certain way but they're not a certain way.Life is simply as it is.Perhaps Benjamin Franklin said it best: \"Our limited perspective, our hopes and fears become our measure of life, and when circumstances don't fit our ideas, they become our difficulties.\" We spend our lives wanting things, people, and events to be just as we want them to be -- and when they're not, we fight and we suffer. The first step in recovering from over-seriousness is to admit that you have a problem.You have to want to change, to become more easygoing.You have to see that your own anxiety is largely of your own creation -- it's made up of the way you have set up your life and the way you react to it. The next step is to understand the link between your expectations and your frustration level.Whenever you expect something to be a certain way and it isn't, you're upset and you suffer.On the other hand, when you let go of your expectations, when you accept life as it is, you're free. A good exercise is to try to approach a single day without expectation.Don't expect people to be friendly.When they're not, you won't be surprised or bothered; if they are, you'll be delighted.Don't expect your day to be problem-free.Instead, as problems come up, say to yourself,  \"Ah, another barrier to overcome.\" As you approach your day in this manner you'll notice how elegant life can be.Rather than fighting against life, you'll be dancing with it.Pretty soon, with practice, you'll lighten up your entire life.And when you lighten up, life is a lot more fun. \n Question: Why are people easily frustrated and anxious these days? \n Options: (A) Because their children are disappointing.

I had got into the habit of sitting in the last carriage at the platform, so I could get off near to the station exit at my end. One evening before getting off the train, I found a purse. I opened the purse and thought this must be my lucky day, for the purse contained some PS80 in cash. Looking further into the purse, I found credit cards, and house keys and a name and address. My first thought when seeing the cash was to pocket it, and throw the other contents away. Now I am not a basically dishonest person, but had developed a hardened attitude over the years that most people were dishonest in some way, and my own personal experience had been that whenever I lost anything of value, that was the last I ever saw of it. And since I was a construction worker at that time, I had been the victim of a great deal of stealing during my working life. Almost as I read the name and address, I had a picture of that woman being struck with terror, when she realized she had lost her purse, and could not get into her home, had no money, and, would have thoughts of someone spending on her credit cards, not to mention the trouble of canceling all the cards. In that same moment I decided to hand the purse over  to the train guard. So I told him I would like to see it returned to its rightful owner. He told me would be sent to the lost property office.

They have the same symptoms, but they react very differently. While Tina reaches for water and vitamins, her husband, Wesley, reached for the phone. \"I'd better make a doctor's appointment,\" he says. Why do these two Chinese people react to sickness so differently? Tina grew up in the U.S. Wesley grew up in Taiwan. And they have discovered that differences between Chinese and American cultures extend   to every area of life. Even sickness and health. When Westerners experience pain, they usually express their discomfort. Most Asians don't. This creates a challenge for American nurses who care for Asian patients in the U.S. How do they know if that calm, quiet patient is really hurting? They have to keep asking their Asian patients how they feel. In addition, Americans usually don't want sickness to slow them down. Unlike Chinese people, Americans often don't take time off work to rest and get well. They'd rather sneeze and cough all day at the office. Americans who get sick in Asia may protest   when Chinese friends suggest they go to the hospital. \"I'm not that sick!\" they may say. In the U.S., only very sick or injured patients go to hospital. People go to a doctor's office for less serious problems. Like Tina, Americans more often turn to vitamins or over-the-counter drugs to help them get well.  Chinese people, however, often head straight for the doctor when they get sick, like Wesley did. They want a prescription   to treat their sickness before it gets serious. Chinese patients often just trust their doctors to give them the information they need. Most Americans, however, ask their doctors lots of questions and do research. American patients want to know everything they can about their condition. So, are one culture's attitudes toward health better than the other's? Perhaps not. Tina and Wesley will both recover from their colds. And today, doctors all over the world are sharing treatment methods with each other. In health, as in everything else, we can learn a lot from each other. \n Question: According to the passage, which of the following might a Chinese not do when he's ill? \n Options: (A) Go to the doctor's.

After her morning exercises and some housework, she drives to the local hospital, where she volunteers once a week. What makes Parker's routine so extraordinary is that she is 104 years old. \"I don't know why I'm still here,\" she said. Dr. Thomas Perls of the Boston University Medical Center is trying to figure that out. As the director of the New England Centenarian   Study, he studies there \"super humans\", those age 100 years and older. \"It's like winning the lottery\", he said. \"You've got to choose the right numbers and the right combination.\" Researchers believe about 30 percent of aging is genetic. For those who get to extremely old ages, family history may play an even more important role. Reuben Landau's mother lived to 100, and three of his brothers and sisters into their 90s. Landau is nearly 102, and he still practices law a few hours every day. Both Landau and Parker are remarkably healthy. They take few medications and have no major illness. Perls has found that many centenarians lack a type of gene -- E4 -- that is associated with an increased risk of heart disease. One study found the gene is in 29 percent of young men, but only 15 percent of centenarians. Perls also believes they may have a \"protective gene\", one that helps them survive what might kill others. Parker, for example, smoked until she was 100 and had a stroke at 89. However, living into your 100s isn't just genetics. Aging successfully has much to do with environment and behavior. Landau watches what he eats and exercises his body and mind every day. He's convinced it's why he's still in good health. \"People still have to do the right things to get to very old age,\" said Perls. So it's not just the cards you're dealt, but how you play the hand. \n Question: By saying \"It's like winning the lottery\", Dr. Thomas Perls means   _  . \n Options: (A) it is quite unusual to be a centenarian (B) it is very difficult to find \"super humans\" (C) it is a tough job investigating the aging process (D) it takes a long time to win a lottery", "output": "A", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

He says the group's latest research also shows that Americans this year are spending more on technology products. \"Here in 2012, $252 on average-the technology spend for consumers this year.\" From tablet computers to smartphones, American shoppers have been lining up to get the newest and coolest electronic devices on the market. There are more choices today than ever before. \"It's kind of hard to make a decision.\" Tablet computers are one of the best-selling products this year. Brian Tong is Senior Editor of CNET.com. The website reports on tech news and examines the latest electronic products. He says the Apple iPad Mini is one of the most popular tablets. Its starting price is $329. One of Apple's biggest competitors is the Google Nexus 7. It starts at $199. \"The hardware inside is more powerful than what's in the iPad Mini, but also it offers you a lot of things like maps that work better than Apple's maps.\" Brian Tong says there is one reason why people may like the iPad Mini more than the Nexus 7. \"If you just want to read books and surf the Internet, you don't really need to get an iPad Mini, but if you want the largest group of apps that's where the iPad and Apple's ecosystem shines the most.\" Elman Chacon is with the electronics store Best Buy. He says another hot product this season is smart cameras. They connect to the Internet through Wi-Fi. This makes it easy for users to email or upload photographs directly from the camera. \"You can literally take a picture, upload it into your Facebook in a matter of seconds. These things are pretty cool because they do a lot of things.\" Streaming media boxes also connect to the Internet. People are able to watch web content such as movies and YouTube videos on their televisions. Another popular item is wireless speaker systems. The newest ones work with any device that has Bluetooth technology, including smartphones, laptops and tablets. With the growing popularity of Internet shopping, many consumers will visit a store first to look at a product, and then go online to find it at a lower price.

My own definitions would set fashion and clothing greatly apart. It is a fact that, in the shopping malls, there are plenty of beautiful garments whose unpredictability makes our life color1ful and interesting. You are almost convinced: You can buy whatever you dare to think. There is no doubt that fashion designers are usually with high qualifications. They study fashion trends, select color1s, and make sure the final production of their designs is done properly. However, as experience grew with age, my attraction to arts became ever stronger. I have a strong desire for clothing to stand as does paint to the painter, as does stone to the sculptor, as a simple and particular language of an individual creation, which draws the audience from an appreciation of the surface to deeper thoughts with the world of the soul. I believe that the most meaningful creative motives should arise through caring for other people, the great care of humanity--a concern for human feeling and spirituality.  _ , but it is bigger than love, and it is unconditional. I believe the greatest works of art can touch the deepest and strongest parts of human feelings and the world of the spirit, and only these works can be the memories of history, preserving the most valuable feelings that have ever existed, and inspiring a greater awareness of ourselves. I am not satisfied if people only appreciate clothing if it merely satisfies their desire. I believe clothing could be a specific creative language for communicating ideas and thoughts, for inspiring you and shaping your behavior. Those clothes fashioned out of necessity possess a power that can continue to exist across the ages. This is what I have tried to achieve, the clothing to return to its original simplicity, the clothing to help people regain the natural sense. The true fashion today should not follow the trends. It should instead uncover the extraordinary in the ordinary, for I believe the pleasure you get from the clothing is not its price, but its spirit. \n Question: According to the writer, most fashion designers are   _  . \n Options: (A) lack of imagination (B) deep in thought (C) unproductive (D) trendy", "output": "D", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

Each week, my best friend and I hang out with senior citizens. Volunteering at a retirement village provides us with a great opportunity to meet new people and enrich the lives of the people we meet. We have learned so much from talking with senior citizens, and we are blessed to have this opportunity to reach out to those in our community. Nothing is more rewarding than seeing the faces of the elderly light up when we walk into the room. Though my school only requires 10 community service hours, I have continued to volunteer throughout high school. While our 10-hour requirement is a good start, schools should require more volunteer hours. Volunteering offers students an irreplaceable way to help their communities and expand their knowledge of the world. Some believe that forcing students to volunteer is defeating the purpose of volunteering, because it's not volunteering if you are required to do it. However, sometimes students need an extra push to reach out to their communities. It's because some students don't know the benefits of volunteering. After they start volunteering, they'll realize that volunteering can benefit them a lot and they will want to volunteer more. Through volunteering, I've learned many valuable life skills. Besides teaching valuable life skills, volunteering may lead to a part-time job opportunity as well. If students prove their reliability and hard work ethic while volunteering, employers may take that into consideration and offer them a job. My best friend got her summer job after volunteering several summers at the Boy Scout camp. There are various other benefits of volunteering. Besides making a difference in people's lives, students develop communication skills and acceptance of others. What's more, reaching out to others who are less fortunate teaches us to be grateful for what we have.

Postal Service (USPS) is losing billions of dollars a year. The government company that delivers \"small mail\" is losing out to email and other types of electronic communication. First-class mail amount fell from a high point of 104 million pieces in 2000 to just 64 million pieces by 2014. Congress permits the 600.000-empIoyee USPS to hold a monopoly   over first-class and standard mail. The company pays no federal, state or local taxes; pays no vehicle fees; and is free from many regulations on other businesses. Despite these advantages, the USPS has lost $52 billion since 2007, and will continue losing money without major reforms. The problem is that Congress is preventing the USPS from reducing costs as its sales decline, and is blocking efforts to end Saturday service and close unneeded post office locations. USPS also has a costly union-dominated workforce that slows the introduction of new ideas or methods down. USPS workers earn significantly higher payment than comparable private-sector workers. The answer is to privatize the USPS and open postal markets to competition. With the rise of the Internet, the argument that mail is a natural monopoly that needs government protection is weaker than ever. Other countries facing declining letter amounts have made reforms Germany and the Netherlands privatized their national postal companies over a decade ago, and other European countries have followed suit. Britain floated shares of the Royal Mail on its stock exchange in 2013. Some countries, such us Sweden and New Zealand, have not privatized their national postal companies, but they have opened them up to competition. These reforms have driven efficiency improvements in all of these countries. Additional number of workers have been reduced, productivity has risen and consumers have benefited. Also, note that cost-cutting measures--such as closing tone post offices--are good for both the economy and the environment. Privatization and competition also encourage new changes. When the USPS monopoly over \"extremely urgent\" mail was stopped in 1979, we saw an explosion in efficient overnight private delivery by firms such as FedEx. The government needs to wake up to changing technology, study postal reforms abroad and let businessmen reinvent our out-of-date postal system. \n Question: What do we know about the USPS? \n Options: (A) Its great competitor is the delivery firm FedEx.

I found a chained sliding door that was wide enough for me to pass through. Inside, there was a heavy smell of dead mice in the dark. After my eyes adjusted, I noticed a shaft   that rose all the way to the top of the barn. On one side was a one-man elevator with a long rope and roller. I stepped onto the platform and gave the rope a drag and the elevator began sliding up the shaft, but stopped halfway. After a brief panic attack, I noticed holes in the wall at regular intervals, forming a ladder. For reasons known only to an 11-year-old, I decided it would be better to go up than down. So, with shaking hands, I began climbing the wall. After what seemed like forever, I reached the top of the shaft. I stood up, dusted myself off and found absolutely nothing of interest. It was just an empty room with a ladder leading up to the roof. I climbed all the way up here for this? Then I noticed a fire extinguisher ,which I'd always wanted to shoot off. So this was the chance of a lifetime. I tried it, and, much to my surprise, the thing worked! It shot out a thick cloud of powder that instantly filled the room. I couldn't breathe. I was going to choke to death, and they'd probably never even find my body. Luckily, I remembered the ladder to the roof. I climbed up, popped the straw roof and saw a bright blue sky. I suddenly realized the dust and powder pouring out of the top could draw attention. So when the dust had settled, I climbed down and slipped out of the chained door. I'm not sure if I was more excited about being alive or about not being caught, but I ran all the way back home. \n Question: When the author got inside the barn, he   _  . \n Options: (A) noticed a man on the elevator (B) opened the chained sliding door (C) saw many dead mice in the dark (D) found a shaft leading to the top", "output": "D", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

Psychologists believe that optimism   is a good defense against unhappiness, so it is better to keep your optimism alive. Feeling sad about your life will only make you sadder, so be happy. 2. Don't Be Afraid to Take Risks. Life is all about taking risks, and that's the exciting part of it. Challenges and failure are part of life. Once you learn how to take risks, you'll soon realize how good it feels not to let moments pass you by. 3. You only have one life, so make it worthwhile. Being unwilling to let the past go just keeps you away from the things you should be enjoying at the present. 4. List the Things You Want to Do. Stop lazing around and give yourself something to be busy with. Write down a list of all the things you want to do and make a timeline, not to stress you out, but to remind you of your goals. So don't put limits to yourself because you'll never know what may happen. 5. Try Out Something New. Getting into something or trying something unfamiliar to you may seem scary, but nothing can make you feel happier than being able to overcome your fear. Who knows? You might enjoy it!

In England, people eat potatoes every day. In the Middle East, bread is the main part of every meal. Eating like so many things we do, becomes a habit which is difficult to change.

There, grandfather ate alone while the rest of the family enjoyed dinner at the dinner table. Since grandfather had broken a dish or two, his food was served in a wooden bowl.

When people have enough money, these wants become demands. Now, it' s important for the managers in a company to understand what their customers want if they are going to develop effective marketing strategies  . There are various ways of doing this. One way at supermarkets, for example, is to interview customers while they're doing their shopping. They can be asked what they prefer to buy and then the results of the research can be studied. This provides information on which to base future marketing strategies. It' s also quite normal for top managers from department stores to spend a day or two each month visiting stores and mixing freely with the public, as if they were ordinary customers, to get an idea of how customers act. Another way to get information from customers is to give them something. For example, some fast food restaurants give away tickets in magazines or on the street that permit customers to get part of their meal for nothing. As well as being a good way of attracting customers into the restaurants to spend their money, it also allows the managers to get a feel for where to attract customers and which age-groups to attract. Another strategy used at some well-known parks such as Disneyland is for top managers to spend at least one day in their work, touring the park dressed as Mickey Mouse or something like that.

She created almost two hundred dance pieces. She is often called the Mother of Modern Dance. Earlier in her life, however, Martha did not know that she would become a dancer. At that time, the dancers were looked down on. So Martha's parents didn't approve of her desire to dance at the beginning. Until 1916, she began her studies at the newly created Denishawn School of Dancing and Related Arts, founded by Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn, where Graham worked very hard to improve her ability to dance because she was considered too old to begin dancing. In 1936, Graham made her defining work, \"Chronicle^, which signaled the beginning of a new era in modern dance. The dance brought serious issues to the stage for the general public in a dramatic manner. Influenced by the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the Great Depression that followed, and the Spanish Civil War, it focused on depression and isolation, reflected in the dark nature of both the set and costumes. Graham continued to dance past the age of seventy. Once again, she was met with criticism from people who came to watch her shows. But she didn't give up. Her last completed ballet was 1990's Maple Leaf Rag. \"A Dancer's World\" is an introduction to Graham and her work. She tells about her dances and her dance group shows some of their methods. Martha Graham received many awards during her lifetime, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in nineteen seventy-six. She was the -first dancer to receive the country's highest civilian  honor. She died in 1991 at the age of ninety-six.

This problem starts back in school when the stressful \"group projects\" are first assigned .The smartest don't want to risk their grade in the class by dividing the work equally and hoping that an average student does his part well. They just take over and do the whole project themselves. And thus begins the smart-people work cycle. The smartest people do just about everything better than most everyone else until it comes to running a business. They are not better. A smart person who can't stand someone else doing a job badly does everything himself. Then, he is stuck with the one-man band \"job-business\" and ends up not being able to grow. However, it is quite interesting and strange that some \"slackers\" ( a person who is lazy and avoids work) are better suited to be a business leader than the \"smart\" people. Smart and talented people often have a gift for the unusual, complicated or different. They don't like to follow the KISS principle (keep it simple, stupid), which is required to make a business succeed. Maybe you think the global presence of McDonald's complex, but in reality, in the company, every single task is broken down into easy-to-follow steps and everything has been standardized. These successful companies have just a few smart enough people to run the majority of the tasks in a way that can't be screwed up by their average employees. So, being smart or talented isn't going to help you unless you can use those smarts to figure out a way to simplify those tasks that will make a business successful.

But they would do well to remember that a new alternative is available--micro-home. Called \"tiny houses\", these houses have all living necessities in a small package, including kitchen, bedroom and bathroom. Generally under 50 square meters, most tiny houses accommodate just one or two people though some claim the space for more. What's lost in size is not lost in design as these homes are often quite unique and modern in design. Besides an attractive appearance, tiny houses can also have unique practical features. Making the best of urban space, the 72- to122-centimeter-wide Keret House in Warsaw, the world's narrowest home, fills in an alley. The Ecocapsule home uses solar power, wind power and rainwater collection to enable its owner to live practically anywhere. A system of rails allows the DALE micro-home to adjust room size and number as well as adding the option of an open or enclosed courtyard. Visually appealing as micro-homes are, there are a few drawbacks to consider before getting cozy on a mini-couch. Moving into a tiny house requires the removing of most non-essentials, regardless of the emotional connection to them. Guests will also mostly be out of the question as the limited space may even cause a solitary   individual to experience some cabin fever  . And finally, a micro-home is likely a temporary living option for most people since they will probably start families and acquiremore possessions. Though the limitations will scare some, there is usually a benefit. A small size results in a small price tag and small bills, making tiny houses easier to save up for and budget. And though you won't have much stuff around the house, this can provide the comfort of simple living and repairs. Micro-homes are also practically mobile and have eco-friendliness that can't be matched by other homes. They probably aren't for everyone or forever, but when it comes to your next (or first) home, they could be just what you need. \n Question: Micro-homes are especially fit for   _  . \n Options: (A) a young couple in hope of settling down permanently (B) an individual constantly suffering from cabin fever (C) a college graduate on a tight budget for the time being (D) a family of five in favor of environmental protection", "output": "C", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

Usually marriages are between one woman(the bride) and one man ( the groom). However, in other parts of the world a man may have several wives, or, as in some areas of India, a wife may have more than one husband.. There are also many different kinds of wedding ceremonies practiced around the world. These ceremonies can be very short and simple, or very long and complicated. One of the largest and most expensive wedding ceremonies in recent times was held in Dubai in 1981. The couple tying the knot at this wedding were the son of Sheik ( a male Arab ruler) Rashid Bin Saeed Al Maktoum and Princess Salama. The wedding ceremony took seven days and cost $44 million. It was held in a large building which was specially built for the ceremony and looked like a stadium. The bride and groom needed a large place for their wedding because more than 20,000 guests were invited. The reasons why a man and woman get married also vary. Sometimes they marry because they are in love, sometimes they marry because someone they meet through a matchmaker, and sometimes they marry because their parents tell them that they must marry. One unusual example of an arranged marrige took place in Bangladesh in 1986.  The groom was an eleven-month-old boy and the bride was a three-month-old girl. They were the youngest married couple ever. The parents of the bride and groom arranged the marriage as a way of ending a fight between the two families who had been arguing over a farm for twenty years. Both families thought they owned the farm, but no one knew exactly . The fight ended for good when the young boy married the young girl. By arranging this marriage, neither famlily was forced to lose face. The two families agreed to give the farm to the young people. \n Question: What is the best title for this passage? \n Options: (A) An Unusual Wedding Tradition (B) A Short History of Marriage (C) Common Western Wedding Trations.

The focus is on battleground states worth 95 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win. Both sides are trying to close the deal with a decreasing number of uncommitted  voters, while making sure supporters actually cast ballots.

Concluding a race expected to cost more than $6 billion overall, Obama and Romney and their running mates will hit all the battleground states -- Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Ohio, New Hampshire, Nevada, Virginia and Wisconsin. The campaigns also are unloading a blast of television ads and mailings that threaten to overwhelm voters already saturated with politicking.

Several years ago when I was working as a newspaper reporter, I interviewed a woman who was a resident at a local nursing home. She was 100 years old. She read at least one book per week, mostly novels. She was bright, intelligent and fun to talk with. \"I love to read. It helps me keep up with what's going on in the world,\" she said. \"A friend of mine brings me a new book every week. I look forward to her visits and I look forward to the books.\" \"I can't get around much any more,\" said the 100-year-old woman, \"but when I read, I can go anywhere, anytime I want. And no one has to help me!\" Reading also sets a good example for younger generations. I have observed that the best readers are those students who see their parents reading. And I'm not talking about only reading novels. Newspapers and magazines are important too. Your actions will communicate a great deal to your children and grandchildren about what you value. But why is reading so important? In this day and age, with television to give us news, and movies and videos to keep us entertained, who needs to read? The answer is everyone. Developing good reading skills does not only mean that you can read a novel or a magazine, it also means being able to read and understand things like a credit card contract or an insurance policy, or the instructions for how to put a new printer to use with your computer.

Lawmakers realize that it may be a long and difficult process to prove in court that a company broke the new law, but they feel that simply having the law in place will accomplish what they want; stopping advertising companies from continuing to influence Israelis with images of unhealthy-looking models as the gold standard of beauty. Some modeling agencies in Israel aren't happy. They say that the indexes on which the law is based are arbitrary  and are not suitable for every model. Many models who are totally healthy girls might be disqualified because of the law. Some models are naturally thin and unable to gain weight and the new law would unfairly prevent them from finding jobs.

But it seems like everyone tells you should be setting goals for everything you want to accomplish, short term and long term. Goals can help you sometimes, but in some cases they just lead to constant frustration and they actually bring you down. Let's look at this a little closer with an example. A lot of people might set forth as a goal. Many people jump online and are looking to start a business online as a way to make money from home and let's say they set a goal to make $10,000 in their first month. They do this because they seem tons of people making large sums of money in very little time so they think, $10,000 a month, that shouldn't be too hard. But what happens when you only bring in $1,000 in your first 30 days online? If this is pure profit you might still be happy but this is nowhere near reaching the goal you originally set out to meet. So naturally you would feel like you failed to reach your goal and you may be a little disappointed in yourself. If you continue not to reach this goal month in month , it starts to add up and really weighs on you. I'm not saying that they are bad and you shouldn't set them but you need to realize that you should not be emotionally attached to your goals. An alternative approach would be to set certain milestones for when you want to accomplish things and start out small. Build your confidence by accomplishing smaller feats and if you overproduce, then it will be a nice surprise. You have to have some sort of end result in mind but break it down in to a day by day task. It makes it a lot easier for you to handle by just knowing everyday you have to complete a few small tasks and over time the snowball will roll into great things. \n Question: The purpose of the passage is to    _   . \n Options: (A) show that it's necessary to set goals (B) prove the disadvantages of setting goals (C) suggest way of setting goals to reach success (D) introduce how to reach success by setting high goals.", "output": "C", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

People with this learning disorder may also have problems when they write. Dyslexia is not related to eyesight or intelligence. The problem involves areas of the brain that process language. Brain scientists are studying whether they can predict which young children may struggle with reading to provide them with early help. John Gabrieli at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is leading the study of five-year-olds in about twenty schools in the Boston area. They studied in the schools with kindergartens. And for all the children joining in the study, they give them a brief set of paper-and-pencil tests to look at which children appear to be at some risk for struggling to read. So far, fifty of them have been examined in a scanner, a special machine, to show brain activity. Written tests are not always able to identify dyslexia or other problems, while brain scans may offer a more scientific way to identify problems. And with reading problems, early identification is important. When it comes to helping children overcome reading difficulties, the younger the child, the more effective they are. Reading problems are not usually identified until a child is in the third or fourth grade. The later children are recognized as poor readers, the less treatment can help. And, as Professor Gabrieli points out, poor reading can make education a struggle. Reading is everything. Even math and science have textbooks. While the children are given tasks related to reading, the brain scans measure the extent to which certain parts of the brain become active while the children do the work. The scientists say they are pleased with early results from the study, but have a long way to go. \n Question: Dyslexia affects the part of brain concerning   _  . \n Options: (A) eyesight (B) intelligence (C) language (D) emotion", "output": "C", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

It was said that an old couple had some sent to them as a great treat. But they did not know how it ought to be used. Eventually they boiled the leaves, put some of them on a piece of bacon for dinner, ate the leaves, and threw the tea soup away. However, tea quickly proved popular enough to replace ale as the national drink of England after King Charles II and his Portuguese wife began to follow this foreign tea tradition. Before the introduction of tea into Britain, the English had two main meals -- breakfast and dinner. Breakfast was ale, bread and beef. Dinner was a long, massive meal at the end of the day. It was no wonder that Anna, the Duchess of Bedford (1788 -- 1861) experienced a _ in the late afternoon. So she invited friends to join her for an additional afternoon meal at five o'clock in her castle. The menu centered around small cakes, bread and butter sandwiches, and, of course, tea. This summer practice proved so popular that the Duchess continued it when she returned to London, sending cards to her friends asking them to join her for \"tea and a walking the fields\". The practice of inviting friends to come for tea in the afternoon was quickly picked up by other social hostesses. A common pattern of service soon came into practice. The first pot of tea was made in the kitchen and carried to the lady of the house who waited with her invited guests, surrounded by fine porcelain from China. The first pot was warmed by the hostess from a second pot (usually silver) that was kept heated over a small flame. Food and tea was then passed among the guests, the main purpose of the visiting being conversation. \n Question: We can know from the passage that afternoon tea   _  . \n Options: (A) leads to the wide planting and large production of tea in England (B) helps bring King Charles II and his wife together in their childhood (C) is not only an additional afternoon meal but helps bring people together (D) contributes to the increasingly high price of tea and porcelain in England", "output": "C", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

Since its beginning in 1980, the Edmonton Folk Music Festival has been commemorating   the true feeling of what folk music is all about and that's the traditional togetherness that is felt when people gather to share stories and feelings through song. This year will be the sixth year when volunteer Riedel will be offering up her time to the festival. \"People coming off a busy spring and summer have a moment of relaxation,\" Riedel said. \"It's really easy to relax, and it's great seeing family and friends have fun together.\" These families and friends come from all different kinds of musical tastes. People who take pleasure in Blues are there, so are people who love Bluegrass. This festival does its best to develop everyone's musical interests. With so many years of experience, the festival has become a well-oiled machine, and does whatever it can to make attendees feel as comfortable as possible. There are free water stations throughout the venue   for people to fill up their travel cups. When people buy food, reusable dishes are given a $2 plate fee, but that is returned when the plate is brought back. The festival has completely sold out of tickets, and in record time. But with big names such as Van Morrison and Jakob Dylan, it's easy to see how that was going to happen. There is no parking area during the festival, so using the Park & Ride system or Edmonton Transit is highly recommended. A bike lock-up area is provided and will be available Thursday until Sunday one hour before the gates open until 45 minutes after the gates close. The Edmonton Folk Music Festival begins on Wednesday, Aug. 4 with Van Morrison playing the special donation fund   concert, and will finish up on Sunday, Aug. 8. \n Question: The Edmonton Folk Music Festival is held mainly to   _  . \n Options: (A) gather people with different musical tastes (B) remind people of the real sense of folk music (C) exhibitive good voices of great talents in folk music (D) collect old stories of folk music", "output": "B", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

A new book written by a self-described Chinese descent  on her super-strict parenting--Battle Hymn of the Tiger Motherhas raised media storm and fierce debates in the U.S. Amy Chua is a Yale Law School professor and the mother of two teenage girls. She is the daughter of immigrants of Chinese descent. In the Chinese culture,the tiger symbolizes strength and power. In her book Ms.Chua writes about how she demanded excellence from her daughters. For example,her daughters,Sophia and Louisa,were never allowed to attend a sleep-over,be in a school play,watch TV or play computer games. They couldn't choose their own after-class activities or get any grade less than an A.They had to play piano or violin--and no other musical instruments. She writes that if a Chinese child gets a B--which she says \"would never happen\"--there would be a screaming,hairtearing explosion\".She describes making her 7-year-old daughter play a piano piece perfectly--yelling and not letting her leave the bench even to use the bathroom--until it was. Many people have criticized Chua. Some say her parenting methods were abusive. She even admits that her husband,who is not Chinese,objects to her parenting style. But she says that was the way her parents raised her and her three sisters. Stacy DeBroff,who has written four books about parenting,says Amy Chua's parenting style is not limited to Chinese families. She says it represents a traditional way of parenting among immigrants seeking a better future for their children. But she also sees a risk. When children have no time to be social or to follow their own interests, they might not develop other skills that they need to succeed in life. Stacy DeBroff advised parents not to just repeat the way they were raised. Alison Lo,an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Washington's Bothell campus said, \"I don't think Amy is advocating a best practice of parenting style, or that success and achievements are critical yardsticks  of a good life. But I can imagine how strong her daughters' college applications are going to be. For many parents whose dreams are seeing their kids graduating from a competitive university,Amy is sharing with the readers that it is achievable by persistent,dedicated parental guidance,\"Lo said in an interview with Julie Muhlstein,a columnist with the US-based Heraldnet.com.\"In that sense,a young adult's giftedness can be born,or made,\"Lo continued. \n Question: According to the passage, which is TRUE of Amy Chua? \n Options: (A) She is an easy-going woman.

If you live in a house, wash your hair, eat fruits and vegetables, drink soda, or drive a car, you can be certain that you are affected by the loss of tropical forests. Biologically, we are losing the richest regions on earth when, each minute, a piece of tropical forest, the size of ten city blocks, disappears. As many as five million species of plants, animals, and insects (40 to 50 percent of all living things) live there, and are being lost faster than they can be found and described. Their loss is immeasurable. Take rubber for example. For many uses, only natural rubber from trees will do. _ are not good enough. Today over half the world's commercial rubber is produced in Malaysia and Indonesia, while the Amazon's rubber industry produces much of the world's four million tons. And rubber is an important material in making gloves, balloons, footwear and many sporting goods. Thousands of other tropical plants are valuable for their industrial use. Many scientists strongly believe that deforestation contributes to the greenhouse effect -- or heating of the earth from increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. As we destroy forests, we lose their ability to change carbon dioxide into oxygen. Carbon dioxide levels could double within the next half-century, warming the earth by as much as 4.5 degrees. The result? A partial melt-down of polar ice caps, raising sea levels as much as 24 feet; even 15 feet could threaten anyone living within 35 miles of the coast. Unbelievable? Maybe. But scientists warn that by the time we realise the severe effects of tropical deforestation, it will be 20 years too late. Can tropical deforestation affect our everyday lives? Now, you should have got the answer. \n Question: According to the passage, which of the following is NOT true? \n Options: (A) The forests are losing their function in turning carbon dioxide into oxygen.

Titan Aerospace, a one-year-old aircraft designer, last week unveiled its Solara 50 and Solara 60 unmanned aircraft. These are two large solar-powered>> high-altitude vehicles the company plans to send up into space for weeks,months>> and eventually years at a time without ever having to land. Titan doesn't refer to these concept aircraft as \"drones  \" or \"unmanned aircraft system,\" but instead calls them \"atmospheric satellites\" for their ability to remain in the sky for extended periods of time just as orbital   satellites do. The company hopes to provide a platform of less than $2 million that governments, private industry, and research institutions can put high into the atmosphere for extended periods of time for a little part of the cost of a space satellite. The idea is that an atmospheric satellite can conduct most of the same operations as an orbital one: atmospheric observation and weather monitoring, communications relay, oceanographic research, and earth imaging. Other operations are impractical for space satellites, such as border security, maritime traffic monitoring and anti-piracy   operations, disaster response, or agricultural observation. And with continuous flight time of up to five years, Solara's aircraft would have endurance   on par with (......) many small satellites, making them a more attractive choice for a range of these applications. \"If you have to go up to the orbital satellite and rent that service>> that's a lot of money,\" says Dustin Sanders, Titan's chief electrical engineer. \"And launching a satellite, that can cost billions of dollars.

He received a phone call from Brown, telling him how much he liked his performance. His singing eventually earned him a fan base and a record contract.

Coffee didn't take off until the l400s when people figured out they could roast its seeds.By the l500s,the drink had spread to coffeehouses across the Arab world.Within another l50 years,it took Europe by storm. \"It actually had a major impact on the rise of business,\" historian Mark Pendergrast says.Coffeehouses became a spot not just to enjoy a cup but to exchange ideas.The insurer Lloyd's of London was founded hundreds of years ago in one of London's 2,000 coffeehouses.Literature,newspapers and even the works of great composers like Bach and Beethoven were also spawned in coffeehouses. It is often said that after the Boston Tea Party of l773,when American colonists attacked British tea ships and threw boxes of tea into the harbor,Americans universally switched over to drinking coffee.In a letter John Adams wrote to his wife,Abigail,the Founding Father claims his love of tea but says he will have to learn to embrace coffee instead,because drinking tea had become a symbol of not loving the country. For all the upsides coffee has brought the modern world,it also led to its fair share of downsides,too.Europeans carried coffee with them as they colonized various parts of the world,and this frequently meant they enslaved people in order to grow it.In Brazil -- where slavery was legal until l888 -- coffee plantations would use slash-and-burn agriculture,tearing down rain forests and planting coffee trees.Once the soil had been exhausted,growers would move on to another place. And yet,coffee,as Pendergrast says,\"had a very good impact in many ways on our civilization,even though it was,for a long time,grown by slaves.\" \n Question: Why did people enjoy going to coffeehouses? \n Options: (A) Because it was a fashion to drink coffee.

This year's Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF), held last May in Cleveland, featured(had)three bicycle projects from three countries. Like many of the other experiments presented at ISEF, the bike projects showed that some of the most interesting scientific research often begins by taking a closer look at things you care about. Renato Angulo Chu had even grander ambitions. The 12th-grader from Lima, Peru, wanted to _ some of his country's economic troubles. \"I see a problem in my country,\" Renato said. \"If you go to the forests in Peru, in some places you cannot find electricity. If you go with my bicycle, you can turn on the lights.\" Renato, 16, spent 3 years designing his special Multibike. The device looks like a fixed exercise bike. It has wires fixed along the frame and a blender strapped (fastened) to the back. Turning the pedals operates the blender. The same principle can be used to sharpen knives or sweep city streets. The Multibike can work either as a fixed bike or as a bicycle able to travel city streets and country roads. It's made from inexpensive materials, and the user gets exercise while pedaling to operate a machine. \"You pedal the bike, and you can mix any drink you want,\" Renato said. More importantly, he added, the same concept could be used to bring light to houses in remote regions of the rainforest. \n Question: Which of the following is true according to the passage? \n Options: (A) ISEF is an exhibiton displaying bicycle experiments designed by students.

Researchers listened to audio recordings of parents playing with their babies aged 10 months to 16 months. The researchers compared the experiences when the children played with electronic toys, traditional toys such as blocks, or when the children looked at books. What they found is that parents talked less with their babies when the babies played with electronic toys. Why is this important? Research shows that how quickly children develop language is often based on what they hear from parents. When the infants played with electronic toys, parents said little to their children. But with traditional toys, such as blocks, parents shared the names and descriptions of the animals, colors and shapes as their children played. There was even more information given by parents as their babies looked at the pictures in books. Of course, there is no need for parents to throw out electronic toys, but they should look at their infants' play with such toys as entertainment, not a learning experience. Toy Industry Association spokeswoman Adrienne Appell responded to the study. She said it is important that parents make time to play with their children. \"Playing is a way that kids can learn so much, not only cognitive  skills, but social and developmental skills,\" she said. She added that play should be balanced, including time for just \"make believe\" activities, as well as traditional and electronic toys. \n Question: What's Anna Sosa's attitude towards companies claiming that their toys are educational? \n Options: (A) supportive (B) doubtful (C) uninterested (D) indifferent", "output": "B", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

These bags are designed to keep air out of crops in storage. Using them is a simple way to fight insects and keep crops fresh.     Ten countries in West and Central Africa are involved in a project to improve the storage of cowpeas, also known as black-eyed peas. Farmers can lose much of the harvest to insects called bruchids  , which grow from egg to adult in a few weeks and then lay forty to sixty eggs. They can destroy the whole harvest within months.     Farmers can sell their crops immediately. But selling at harvest time means more competition and lower prices.Or they can use pesticides   to kill the bugs. But a crop scientist Dieudonne Baributsa says, \"They end up misusing or overusing the pesticide. In Nigeria, they have reported a lot of cases of death. They usually call cowpeas 'killer beans' in Nigeria.\"     Mr. Baributsa is a researcher at Purdue University in Indiana, America. The project is called PICS---Purdue Improved Cowpea Storage. He says the storage bags are thick enough that any insects already in the cowpeas willdie from a lack of oxygen. The lack of air will also help prevent the growth of bacteria that can ruin the harvest. The bags cost about two dollars each. Mr. Baributsa says that is not much, especially if it means farmers can wait long enough to get a better price for their crops. The bags are produced locally. Donors currently support the project, but the groups involved are working to build a lasting market for the bags because donation for the project will not lastforever.     A company based in the United States called GrainPro makes another kind of airtight bags. These are called SuperGrainbags. Phil Villers, the company's president, says storing a harvest safely not only helps farmers earn more money, but also reduces the amount of the harvest loss to insects, spoilage and mishandling. \"What does not get wasted and eaten means it is possible to feed a hungry world,\" said Phil Villers. \n Question: What is the best title for this passage? \n Options: (A) Simple bags save the harvest.

Seal the bag. l Put milk, vanilla, and sugar into the small bag, and seal it. l Place the small bag inside the large one, and seal it again carefully. l Shake until the mixture turns into ice cream, which takes about five minutes. l Wipe the top of the small bag, and then open it carefully. Enjoy! Tips: 1/2 cup of milk will make about one spoon of ice cream, so double the recipe if you want more. But don't increase the amount more than _ --a large amount might be too big for kids to pick up because the ice itself is heavy. Here is another version of the homemade ice cream recipe from another parent! These are the homemade ice cream ingredients: 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla butter and nuts; 1 tablespoon of sugar; 1/2 cup of milk. These are the other supplies: Plastic sandwich bag; 12 salt pellets; 1 dish of ice; large plastic bag. Put the ice cream ingredients in the small bag, and then put the bag, salt and ice in the big bag. Hold the bag shut and move it around on the floor for about 5 minutes. When I made ice cream at home last time, although the salt pellets didn't really dissolve   that well, I still got ice cream. It was not smooth ice cream, probably because of the low-fat milk. It was incredible that it could be ready in 5 minutes (not counting preparing the ingredients) Next, I changed the recipe, using a tablespoon of cocoa, a tablespoon of sugar, and a cup of milk. It was a bit too chocolaty, but good! \n Question: Which of the following things is NOT included in both recipes? \n Options: (A) Sugar (B) Ice (C) Plastic bag (D) Nuts", "output": "D", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

Researchers in human nutrition at the University of Otago have found that teenage boys who sleep less have more body fat when compared to girls, for whom lack of sleep has no noticeable effect on their body fat ratios. The study of 386 boys and 299 girls aged 15 to 18 found that average-sized 16-year-old boy weighing 69.5 kg and 176 cm tall, who slept for eight hours a day, had a waist size l.8 cm bigger and l.6 kg, or 9 percent, more body fat than the average-sized boy who slept 10 hours a day. \"The boys who slept eight hours a day would also have l.8 kg more lean (bone and muscle) mass compared to the boys who slept 10 hours, but that's only a 1.4-percent increase, compared to the 9- percent increase seen in body fat,\" said lead researcher from the Department of Human Nutrition, Dr. Paula Skidmore. \"Our results suggest that for older teenage boys, making sure that they get enough sleep may help to maintain a healthier body. It seems to be that, within reason, the more sleep the better for boys,\" Skidmore said in a statement Thursday. \"It was unexpected that we did not find the same result in girls, who may actually be more aware of their diet and more in tune with a healthier lifestyle.\" The researchers ruled out the effects of food choice and number of screens, such as televisions, games and consoles, which the teenagers had in their bedrooms. \n Question: What's the research really about? \n Options: (A) Boys and girls.

People were eager to learn about his trips to places like the Sandwich Islands (now Hawaii), Egypt and the Holy Land. Twain often used the fees he earned from his lectures to pay for more adventures. His well-attended performances also served to bring attention to his published work. At that time, the public lecture was a very popular form of entertainment, and audiences' expectations ran high, but Twain never failed to amuse them. Twan also wrote on amusing subjects. In 1873, he released a book called The Gilded Age. The book was a satire of the very wealthy of the time. A satire is a work that makes fun of bad human behavior, such as wasteful spending. Twain made people laugh at the excesses of the rich. In 1889, Twain took on other members of the Establishment. He wrote A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, about a boy who travels back to the time of King Arthur. Twain made fun of those who were given advantages not because they had earned them but because of their family connections.

At fourteen, Dorothea was teaching school at Worcester, Massachusetts. A short time after she had begun teaching, she set up a school for young girls in her grandparents' home. Stress was placed on moral character at Dorothea's school, which she conducted until she was thirty-three. She was forced to give up teaching at her grandparents' home, however, when she became ill a few years of inactivity followed. In 1841 Dorothea began to teach again, accepting a Sunday school class in the East Cambridge, Massachusetts prison. Here she first came upon insane people   locked up together with prisoners. In those days insane people were treated even worse than prisoners. There were only a few madhouses in the entire country. Therefore prisons, poor houses, and houses of correction were used to keep the insane. Dorothea Dix made a careful investigation of the inhuman treatment of the insane. It was considered unfeminine   for a woman to devote herself to such work at this time. But this did not stop Dorothea Dix from providing proper medical care for the insane. Gradually, because of her investigations, conditions were improved. More than thirty mental institutions were founded or rebuilt in the United States because of her hard work.

In order to reduce global warming we need to make our carbon footprints smaller. But how much CO2are we responsible for? A new book by Mike Berners Lee, an expert, might be able to help. The carbon footprint looks at the different things we do and buy, and calculates the amount of CO2all of the following created: the ingredients, the electricity, the equipment, the travel and commuting of the beer, and the packaging. It's amazing how many different things need to be included in each calculation. And it's frightening how much carbon dioxide everything produces. This can help us decide which beer to drink. From Berners Lee's calculations, it's clear that a pint (568ml) of locally _ beer has a smaller carbon footprint than a bottle of imported beer. This is because the imported beer has been transported from far away, and it uses more packaging. The local beer only produces 300g of CO2, but the imported beer produces 900g! So, one pint of local beer is better for the environment. Berners Lee has even calculated the carbon footprint of cycling to work. Nothing is more environmentally friendly than riding a bike, surely? Well, it depends on what you've had to eat before. To ride a bike we need energy and for energy we need food. So if we eat a banana and then ride a kilometer, our footprint is 65g of CO2. However, if we eat bacon before the ride, it's 200g. In fact, bananas are good because they don't need packaging, they can be transported by boat and they grow in natural sunlight. So, does this mean that cycling is bad for the environment? Absolutely not, for a start, if you cycle, you don't use your car, and the fewer cars on the road, the fewer traffic jams. And cars in traffic jams produce three times more CO2than cars traveling at speed. Cycling also makes you healthy and less likely to go to hospital. So maybe it's time for us all to start making some changes.

The study, which followed more than 1300 adults over 2 years, found that those who consistently used a mobile phone through out the study period were more likely to report negative \"spillover\" between work and home life--and, in turn, less satisfaction with their family life. Spillover(,) actually means that the line between work and home began to become unclear. Work life may invade home life--when a parent is taking job-related calls at home, for instance--or family issues may start to take up work time. For example, a child may call Mom at work, telling her \"the microwave exploded\", explained Noelle Chesley, an assistant professor of society at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee and the author of the study. The problem with cell phones seems to be they are allowing for ever more spillover between work and home. This may be especially true for working women, the study found. Among men, consistent use of mobile phones seemed not to allow more work issues to creep  into family time. But for women,  the spillover tended to go in both directions--being \"connected\" means that work cuts into home time, and family issues come into work life. Cell phones seem to be opening more lines for stressful exchange among family members. But there may be ways to control the spillover, according to Chesley. Employers, she said, should look at their policies on contacting employees after working hours to make sure their expectations are \"reasonable\".

They examined differences between red squirrels and gray squirrels in the American state of Indiana. The scientists wanted to know how these differences could affect the growth of black walnut   trees. The black walnut is the nut of choice for both kinds of squirrels. The black walnut tree is also a central part of some hardwood forests. Rob Swihart of Purdue University did the study with Jake Goheen, a former Purdue student now at the University of New Mexico. The two researchers estimate that several times as many walnuts grow when gathered by gray squirrels as compared to red squirrels. Gray squirrels and red squirrels do not store nuts and seeds in the same way. Gray squirrels bury nuts one at a time in a number of places. But they seldom remember where they buried every nut. So some nuts remain in the ground. Conditions are right for them to develop and grow the following spring. Red squirrels, however, store large groups of nuts above ground.

And rock and roll music would almost be impossible without this instrument. Music experts do not agree about where the guitar was first played. Most agree it is ancient. Some experts say an instrument very much like a guitar was played in Egypt more than 1,000 years ago. Most experts say that the ancestor of the modern guitar was brought to Spain from Persia sometime in the 12thcentury. The guitar continued to develop in Spain. In the 1700s it became similar to the instrument we know today. Many famous musicians played the instrument. The famous Italian violins Niccole Paganism played and wrote music for the guitar in the early 1800s. Franz Schubert used the guitar to write some of his famous works. In modern times Spanish guitarist Andres Segovia helped make the instrument extremely popular. In the 1930s, Les Paul began experimenting to make an electric guitar. He invented the solid-bodied electric guitar in 1946. The Gibson Guitar Company began producing its famous Les Paul Guitar in 1952. It became a powerful influence on popular music. The instrument has the same shape and the same six strings   as the traditional guitar, but it sounds very different.

Vitamin D is produced naturally by the skin in response to(...) sunlight and may help to slow the ageing process and protect against heart disease, according to the study. Researchers from King's College London studied 2,160 women aged between 18 and 79, looking at their telomeres--- a biological marker of ageing found in DNA. As people get older, their telomeres get shorter and they become more susceptible  to certain illnesses. But the study found women with high levels of vitamin D had comparatively longer telomeres--- a sign of being biologically younger and healthier. The study suggests vitamin D may help to slow down the ageing process of DNA, and therefore the ageing process as a whole. Lead researcher Dr Brent Richards said, \"These results are exciting because they show for the first time that people who have higher levels of vitamin D may age more slowly than people with lower levels of vitamin D.\" This could help to explain how vitamin D has a protective effect on many ageing related diseases, such as heart disease and cancer.\" Professor Tim Spector, a co-author of the report, added, \"Although it might sound absurd  , it's possible that the same sunshine which may increase our risk of skin cancer may also have a healthy effect on the general ageing process.\" Vitamin D made by the action of sunlight on the skin accounts for 90 percent of the body's supply, but lower levels can also be got through food such as fish, eggs and breakfast cereals . Other studies have suggested the vitamin plays a key role in protecting against cancer and heart disease. \n Question: A certain amount of sunshine helps people stay young because   _  . \n Options: (A) people feel happy and energetic in the sun (B) sunshine protects people against heart disease (C) vitamin D makes one's skin look young and healthy (D) vitamin D may help to slow the ageing process", "output": "D", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

Gasoline hits four dollars a gallon!\"                 No one will really be shocked -- except, perhaps, the old-timers who tell about the good old days when gas was three gallons for a dollar, and people drove around \"just for the fun of it\". As a matter of fact, the price of gas has been rising fast and steadily for several years, and many adjustments have already been made.                  There was, for a time, considerable unemployment in the auto industry, and three quarters of the garages and service stations have gone out of business. However, the bicycle and motor-scooter business has flourished , and many people have found employment there. Now that Federal Motors has brought out its new Lilliput, which travels forty miles on a gallon, the auto business is picking up again. The factories that haven't switched over to two-wheel transportation are working on their new smaller models. There is talk, too, about bringing out new steam and electric automobiles that will be just as economical as the old cars. In the meantime, streetcars are gradually replacing buses all over the country because of the greater economy of electric power. And many people who have seldom used public transportation are now riding the streetcars while their automobiles rust in their garages. There's no market at all for their big, luxurious cars, for only the wealthy can now afford to operate them. Many people are now shopping in their own neighborhood, and small businesses are thriving.                  Ministers, educators, and editorial writers are pointing out that there has been a great improvement in family life. Families now stay at home more for their fun, and children and parents are becoming better acquainted. The stores report a booming business in parlor games, hobby materials, books, musical instruments and albums.                  People have lost their pale indoor look. The revival of the lost art of walking has brought a healthy pink back to many a cheek. This return to the heels has revolutionized the clothing styles; people now need to be ready for all kinds of weather.                  These conditions, however, may not last. Already our clever chemists are at work on new synthetic fuels which, they say, will put us right back where we were -- on wheels. Shall we wish them success or not? \n Question: Which of the following is NOT a result of the gas price rising? \n Options: (A) More people prefer to travel on public transportation which costs less than driving cars. (B) People shop in nearby stores without having to drive, so small businesses are declining. (C) People return to the traditional exercise of walking, which helps them to look healthier.

One idea is to educate doctors in smaller communities and hope they stay. Dr. William Cathcart-Rake heads a new program at the University of Kansas in the Midwest. \"We need more doctors. There's somewhere like a quarter of all of our physicians in Kansas who are sixty years of age or older. So we need to be replacing physicians, too.\"Says Dr. William Cathcart. He also says medical students from rural areas now typically study in Wichita or Kansas City, two of the biggest cities in Kansas. They say, \"You know, I really have every intention of coming back to rural Kansas,\"but they meet a soul mate, they get married, their soul mate happens to be from a big city and we never see them again. They get captured in the big city. Hopefully, if we train them in smaller communities, they can meet the future _ here , they can network here, and they have those connections which can hopefully be lifelong. The program is based in Kansas' tenth largest city , Salina, home to about fifty thousand people. Salina is about a three-hour drive from Kansas City, past fields of corn, soybeans and cattle. Student Claire Hinrichsen grew up in a town of about six hundred people. She attended the University of Kansas, or KU, as an undergraduate. One reason why the chose the Salina program is because of the size. There are only eight students--the smallest medical school in the country. Classes are taught by professors in Salina or on a video link from Kansas City or Wichita. Students who complete the four year program will then do their residency training in a small community in the surrounding area. One place a resident might work is the Clay Center Clinic, where Dr. Kerry Murphy is a family physician. Rural doctors generally serve older, poorer patients. Going into a specialty in a big city can mean better working hours and more money to pay off student loans. The Salina program will pay tuition for each year that students practice in a rural area in Kansas. \n Question: The reason why the medical students don't want to go back to rural areas is that  _  . \n Options: (A) they don't like to live in the rural Kansas (B) there are not many girls in the rural Kansas (C) they found their soul mates in cities (D) the life in rural Kansas is so hard", "output": "C", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

Also known as red ball, the game was invented in 1893 by German laborers who wished to play polo , but could not afford horses. While the sport has not _ in North America, it is very fashionable in Europe and even Japan. Played in an indoor court, cycle ball is similar to soccer in many ways--the aim is to score as many goals as possible, and only the goalkeeper is allowed to touch the ball. The one big difference? Use of legs is forbidden. Instead, players have to guide the ball across the court, using the front wheels of their bicycles or with their heads. In fact, if a player even touches the floor with his feet during the 14-minute game, it is considered a foul  and the opposing team gets a free kick. While the game was initially  played with normal bikes, things are a little different now. The seats of these specialized bikes are positioned over the back tire and they sport a single fixed gear, making it easier for the rider to control the constant back and forth movement required for the game. The handlebars  also point straight up so that the competitors can sit upright while playing and they are about twice the weight of normal bikes, which helps with the stability. While cycle ball may sound a little strange, it is a fast-paced sport that requires much training, skill, and, is also really fun to watch. \n Question: What does the passage mainly talk about? \n Options: (A) The origin and development of soccer (B) The differences between cycle ball and soccer.

Unfortunately, gang culture can be found in many British schools, and it brings with it negative, and dangerous, side effects. The presence of weapons at or near school, the appearance of graffiti on buildings and lockers, and pressure to blow off school work and exams all follow where the gangs lead. None of these things contribute to a good education, but for school gangs that's exactly the point - school is for being popular and having fun, not learning anything or preparing for the future. Keep these tips in mind and say goodbye to school gangs. Know your own mind. Often it is those with low self-esteem and a poor self-image who become victims of school gangs. These students don't know their own mind or have a clear picture of what they would like to do in the future, so it is easy to be influenced by those who don't want to do any work today. Keep yourself busy. School gangs often hang around at or near schools with no real reason. Students who have nothing scheduled can easily be sucked into these groups, but if you are busy, busy, busy and always on the move there will be less chance that you'll have the time to stay and \"play\". Choose your friends wisely. With a core group of like-minded friends, it is much easier to stay away from school gangs because you simply don't need them. Remember that gangs are a source of power for members, but they can also be a source of intimidation. Work hard and have fun. No one likes a teacher's pet, but school gangs in particular hate them. Work hard and have fun at school, but don't annoy anyone with extreme goody-two-shoes  behaviour. School gangs can be a nightmare if you must deal with them constantly.

So what makes the idea of organic farming popular? Organic farming means farming with natural materials, rather than with man-made fertilizers or pesticides . Organic farmers rely on many methods -- such as crop rotation   and the use of resistant varieties, because they are necessary for organic farmers to _ the shortage of man-made chemicals. Organic farming is often supposed to be safer than traditional farming for the environment. Yet after a long research on organic farming worldwide for a number of years, science continues to be against this opinion.

This book benefit was seen across countries, and held regardless of the parent's educational back-ground, father's occupation or the political system of the country, the researchers say. The results, based on data from 73,249 people living in 27 countries, including the United States, show that having a 500-book library boosted a child's education by 3.2 years on average. \"You get a great effect for your books,\" said study researcher Mariah Evans, a sociologist at the University of Nevada, Reno. \"It's quite a good return-on-investment in a time of scarce resources.\" For years, educators have thought the strongest predictor of attaining high levels of education was having parents who were highly educated. But according to the findings, a good-sized book library is just as good as university-educated parents in terms of increasing education level. \"Even a little bit goes a long way,\" in terms of the number of books in a home, Evans said. Having as few as 20 books in the home still has a significant impact on propelling a child to a higher level of education, and the more books are added, the greater the benefit. In some countries, such as China, having 500 or more books in the home propels children 6. 6 years further in their education. In the United States, the effect is less, 2.4 years. But, Evans points out that 2.4 years is still a significant advantage in terms of educational achievement. For example, Americans who have some college or an associate's degree, but not a bachelor's degree, earn an average of $ 7,213 more annually than those with just a high school education. Those who attain a bachelor's degree earn $ 21,185 more each year, on average, than those with just high school diplomas. Having books in the home is twice as important as the father's education level, and more important than whether a child was educated in China or the United States. \n Question: What was the author's purpose of writing the passage? \n Options: (A) To display the close relations between jobs and books.

In fact, I firmly believe \"If it's yellow, let it mellow; if it's brown, flush it down.\" I'm sure a lot of it has to do with the fact that I work at home. Alone (well, except for the cats and dog). All day. And I drink a lot of water, which makes for many trips to the bathroom. Another thing I have to admit: I also try to use very little toilet paper. I wash my hands after, though. Every time. (So maybe the water I don't use flushing makes up for the water used to wash my hands?) Ironically, my husband, who only uses toilet paper when necessary, always flushes. But he doesn't seem to mind that I don't flush every time. Or, at least not enough to file for divorce. Yet. Posted by Juliet Farmer Jun 14, 2010 at 10:21 PM  _  When I'm at home alone I do not flush every time I pee .  My husband hates that, though, so when he's home, I flush a little more often.  I grew up doing that because I had a family that lived with huge tanks and you have to do it that way because it's easier on the system, so it doesn't bother me.  I do flush when I'm out in public, at people's houses that don't have big tanks and when we have company! CherBearCM, Jun 15, 2010 at 4:21 PM Not always.

These very small loans  , usually less than US$200, have enabled the very poorest people to set up or expand businesses and become self-sufficient. The micro-credit movement started with Professor Muhammad Yunus, who founded the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. Professor Yunus, who won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize, used his own money to set up a bank to benefit the poorest people in Bangladesh--families living on less than US$1 a day. There are now hundreds of organizations around the world following his blueprint to help people escape from poverty. So how does the system work? Local microfinance institutions (MFIs) make contact with families and offer loans, usually to women, to enable them to start or expand a business. These are very poor people who would not normally be able to get credit, but as no collateral   is required they can get micro-credits. They pay back the loan on a weekly basis, over six months to a year. A very important aspect to the success of the micro-credit system is that receivers get local support. The MFIs educate local communities about ways to improve their lives, and offer practical support as well as collecting weekly loans payments. They encourage people to help each other, so that the whole community can pull itself out of poverty. MFIs may also help with literacy and health problems. Micro-credits are mainly given to women. Experience has shown that women are more motivated to improve their children's lives and will spend the money they make on better nutrition and schooling for their children. This may be the first chance they've had to contribute financially to the family, and their status in the home and the local community is raised. The micro-credit system is not charity. The payments are fixed-term loans and interest is charged. The costs of making such small loans, collecting them and giving personal support are high. This is shown in the interest rates, which range from 15 to 35 percent. Despite this, the repayment rate is very high, between 95 and 98 per cent, showing that micro-credit clients really value this opportunity to leave poverty behind. \n Question: Micro-credits are offered to the poorest people around the world in order to   _  . \n Options: (A) make money out of the poor (B) support poor people out of poverty (C) set up more charity organizations (D) encourage economic growth worldwide", "output": "B", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

In this age of visual and aural hyper-stimulation, the medium of radio is making a great comeback. \"We're at the beginning of a golden age of audio,\" said US-based podcaster Alex Blumberg in an article in The Sydney Morning Herald. In the last month alone, 15 percent of US adults listened to a radio podcast  . These statistics, released by Edison Research, show the successful evolution of traditional radio broadcasts to the present day's digital podcast format. The term \"podcast\" was invented in 2004, but the trend only started gaining mainstream popularity in recent years. With the sharp increase in consumer demand for smartphones and tablets, podcast sales have jumped. The appeal of the podcast partly lies in its multiplatform delivery and on-demand capabilities  . You can listen during those extra minutes of the day when you're walking to the shops, waiting in a queue or riding the subway. Similar to television shows, podcasts are generally free to download and most offer new content every week. Donna Jackson, 22, Sydney University media graduate, listens to podcasts two or three times a week, via iTune. \"I listen while I'm wandering around the house doing something else. It makes completing a boring task much more enjoyable... And it's an easy way of keeping in touch with what's going on in the rest of the world,\" she said, \"I mainly listen to BBC podcasts, but recently I've also been listening to This American Life and Serial. They have a special skill to really draw you in.\" Unlike television and music, the audio format has the potential to create a deep impression on readers. Blumberg says this owes to the podcast's ability \"to create close relationship and emotional connection.\" Sydney University undergraduate Hazel Proust, majoring in social work and arts, agrees. \"When you're listening, it feels as if the voice of the podcast's storyteller is talking directly to you. It's comforting.\" said Proust. It seems the age-old tradition of verbal storytelling is very much alive and well. \n Question: The writer mentions Donna Jackson mainly to   _  . \n Options: (A) tell how young people relax themselves (B) explain why young people like podcasts (C) introduce what programs podcasts are presenting (D) show how popular podcasts are presenting", "output": "B", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

Of course, they also cry to let us know they are wet, hurt, or bored, but we soon learn to tell the difference and try to meet each need somehow. When we begin to feed them solid foods, they let us know when they have had enough by turning away from the spoon - or refusing the food back at us! Why is it that once children are old enough to sit at the table their parents are often heard bargaining with them or threatening them to finish all their dinner? When we make our children eat up the plate that we filled, we don't pay attention to their born ability to know how much, and what, their bodies need. Instead, we should allow them to use their own hunger feelings to determine how much they need, while we provide a balance of nutritious and \"fun\" foods. When we teach them about moderation and set a great example by living an active, healthy lifestyle, they will be less likely to develop weight problems later in life. Think of your slim friend who eats whatever she wants -but will refuse ice cream if she has had enough to eat! \"Eat all your dinner if you want dessert\" translates to \"you must overeat so I will reward you by letting you overeat some more!\" By using sweets as a reward for good behavior, kids begin to believe sweets are really special and they may want them even more.

Alfredo Di Stefano was the son of a soccer player, as was Pele. Most players begin playing the game at the age of three or four. Finally, many great players come from the same kind of neighborhood---a poor, crowded area where a boy's dream is not to be a doctor, lawyer, or businessman, but to become a rich, famous athlete or entertainer. For example, Liverpool, which produced the Beatles, had one of the best English soccer teams in recent years. Pele practiced in the street with a \"ball\" made of rags.

Every year, 390,000 children under age 15 go to hospital emergency rooms with bike-related injuries. Of that number, about one third children suffer head injuries and an estimated 200 die. By wearing a helmet, a child can reduce her risk of injury by as much as 85 percent. But remember ---- a bicycle helmet must fit properly to be safe. Here are five steps to making sure your child's helmet fits properly. 1) If you haven't bought your child's helmet already, you might want to consider one with a rear stabilizer . A rear stabilizer holds the back of the head gently and helps the helmet stay correctly positioned. 2) The helmet should fit closely and shouldn't slide from side to side or front to back. If your child can put two fingers on both temples inside the helmet, it's too big. Try a smaller size. But if the next size down is too small, use the fit pads . Fit pads come in different sizes and attach to the helmet with Velcro. 3) Tell your child to open her mouth widely and ask if she can feel the helmet push down onto the top of her head. If she can't, you need to readjust her helmet. 4) To prevent strap slippage, wind a rubber band around the strap where it meets the fastener. 5) Recheck the fit regularly. You should replace the bicycle helmet: If she has been in an accident with it. If the buckle  breaks or if a piece breaks off. If it doesn't have a U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, American Society for Testing and Materials, or Snell Memorial Foundation sticker. If it doesn't fit correctly. Even if the helmet fit perfectly two years ago, it might be too small now. \n Question: Who is this passage mainly written for? \n Options: (A) Children. (B) Teachers. (C) Parents.

The State Council has organized an investigation team to probe   into what caused the disaster in the city of Linfen, North China's Shanxi Province. Preliminary  investigations show the illegal mining of an unauthorized seam , and the number of miners who had been sent down the shaft far exceeded its capacity. This mine was found to have long ignored the rules to steal state coal, and did not have a list of miners employed to check the number of miners missing after the accident. How did such a coal mine get all the necessary licenses for production? How did it pass the three safety inspections the local government organized last month? In response to this disaster, the Shanxi governor promised to set up hotlines for people to report illegal coal mines and rewards as high as 100,000 yuan for _  We appreciate the action this governor has taken to solving the coal mining problems, and we believe that the reporting scheme will help to stop the existence of illegal coal mines. But at the same time we have reason to question how governments at various levels supervise these mines. The sad fact that such a mine with serious safety problems could pass three consecutive  local government safety inspections in a month is enough to tell us how ineffective the safety inspections were. What if these inspections were just a formality ? What if the inspectors were bribed by the mine owners to turn a blind eye to the safety dangers?

He came to America to make his dreams come true, but ended up fulfilling everyone else's.\"I always wanted to be somebody,\" Tabia said.\"But now I just want the opportunity to help others.\"     That is why, not long ago, Tabia started the Bay Area Gardeners Foundation. It's a charity aiming at helping smart kids like Noel Chavez, whose dream was to become the first in his family to graduate from college.Unfortunately, since Noel is still waiting for his citizenship, he's not qualified for financial aid.And after just a few months of going to school full-time and working full-time, he was ready to give in.     \"I'm working too much. I'm not going to do it. It's impossible. But then you get some help, and that's my break. \"  The break was a  $  1,500 scholarship from the Gardeners Foundation.

Some even think it can help to solve one of the country ' s worst problems ~: crime  . Crime worries a lot of people. Every year, the number of crimes is up and up. And many criminals  are young. They often come from sad homes, with only one parent or no parents at all. There are many young criminals in prison,but prison doesn ' t change them. Six or seven in ten will go back to crime when they come out of prison. One man ,Bob Burton, thought of a new idea. In the old days, young men had to live a difficult life on the road. They learned to be strong and brave, and to help their friends to be strong and brave, and to help their friends in time of danger. This helped them grow into men. So Bob Burton started \"Vision Quest. \" He takes young criminals on a long ,long journey with horses and wagons  , 3,000 miles through seven states. They are on the road for more than a year. The young people in Vision Quest all have bad problems. Most of them have already spent time in prison. This is their last chance. It's hard work on the road. The day starts before the sun comes up. The boys and girls have to feed the horses. Some of them have never loved anyone before  but they love their horses. That love can help them to live a new life.

A new study suggests that moderate background noise is a better spur  to creative thinking than the sound of silence,Time magazine reported. A paper published in the Journal of Consumer Research says that the perfect working environment should buzz with a little noise. Researchers found that test subjects were at their most creative when background noise was measured at 70 decibels,the level one might find in a busy coffee shop. A nearly silent environment(50 decibels)was too quiet. Turning up the volume to 85 decibels (a jackhammer tearing up the pavement outside your building) was counterproductive-the noise became a distraction. The researchers asked 65 students at the University of British Columbia,Canada,to perform various creative tasks while noises recorded at a roadside restaurant were played in the background. In one experiment,scientists asked participants to brainstorm ideas for a new type of mattress . Test subjects had the most successful discussions when the noise in the background was noticeable but not too loud. While a quiet environment may make it easier to read a book. the authors of the study say that moderate background noise creates just enough of a distraction to force people to think more imaginatively, without breaking their focus so completely that they can't think at all. Should we all head for Starbucks to get creative? Not necessarily. Researchers found limited work time surrounded by the low-level noise of a coffeehouse is what really stimulates creativity. Equally, working in a care environment isn't good for everybody. The productivity boost was most obvious among those who were naturally creative to begin with. \n Question: The recommended level of background noise is  _  . \n Options: (A) 50 decibels (B) 65 decibels (C) 70 decibels (D) 85 decibels", "output": "C", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

In the Chinese lunar calendar, the 23rd day of the 12th lunar month, which falls on Feb 11 this year, is the \"Little Chinese New Year\". Traditionally, people will set off firecrackers to bid farewell to the Kitchen God who returns to Heaven to report the activities of every household over the past year to the Jade Emperor. However, such customs have lessened with time in the city and might seem unfamiliar to children nowadays. In order to preserve traditions for the next generation, Yu Dawu, a 66-year-old painter, recently published a picture book, Spring Festival in Beijing, for children to see how people used to celebrate the Chinese New Year. Based on an essay by Lao She (1899-1966), one of the most significant writers in modern Chinese literature, the picture book starts from the first holiday, La Ba, the eighth day of the 12th lunar month of the past year, when tradition says people should eat _ made of eight ingredients to bring good fortune in the coming year. It concludes with the Lantern Festival on the 15th day of the first lunar month of the new year, which marks the end of the Spring Festival. In the book, Yu creates a local family of four who live in an ordinary quadrangle courtyard, and readers follow the family as it celebrates the festival traditions. \"I am an old Beijinger, so when I was drawing and painting for this book, the memories of childhood rushed into my mind,\" recalls Yu at a book-sharing party earlier this week. \n Question: What's the name of the new picture book that recaptures the capital's Lunar New Year traditions for children? \n Options: (A) Celebrating the Lantern Festival (B) Spring Festival in Beijing (C) the Chinese New Year (D) Little Chinese New Year", "output": "B", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

I feel there are a number of reasons for this. Some people blame the fact that we are surrounded by shops selling unhealthy, fatty foods, such as fried chicken and ice cream, at low prices. This has turned out a whole generation of grown-ups who seldom cook a meal for themselves. If there were fewer of these restaurants, then probably children would buy less take-away food. There is another argument that blames parents for allowing their children to become overweight. I agree with this, because good eating habits begin early in life, long before children start to visit fast food shops. If children are given fried chicken and chocolate rather than healthy food, or are always allowed to choose what they eat, they will go for sweet and salty foods every time, and this will carry on throughout their lives. There is a third reason for this situation. Children these days take very little exercise. They do not walk to school. When they get home, they sit in front of the television or their computers and play computer games. Not only is this an unhealthy pastime , it also gives them time to eat more unhealthy food.What they need is to go outside and play active games or sports. The above are the main reasons for this problem, and therefore we have to encourage young people to be more active, as well as _ them away from fast food shops and bad eating habits. \n Question: According to the text, what kind of children may eat more unhealthy food? \n Options: (A) Those who often take exercise.

In a newly melted part of Greenland, Australian scientists found the leftover structure from a community of microbes  that lived on an ancient seafloor. Based on their analysis of the fossils, the researchers determined that they are 220 million years older than those discovered in Western Australia, which were 3.48 billion years old. The discovery shows life may have formed quicker and more easily than once thought, about half a billion years after Earth formed. And that may also give hope for life forming elsewhere, such as Mars, said study co-author Martin VanKranendonk of the University of New South Wales and director of the Australian Center for Astrobiology. \"It gives us an idea how our planet evolved and how life gained a foothold,\" VanKranendonk said. Scientists had thought it would take at least half a billion years for life to form after the molten Earth started to cool a bit, but this shows it could have happened quicker, he said. That's because the newly found fossil is far too complex to have developed soon after the planet's first life forms, he said. In an outcrop of rocks that used to be covered with ice and snow which melted after an exceptionally warm spring, the Australian team found stromatolites , which are layered structures that are often produced by a community of microbes. The stromatolites were about 1 to 4 centimeters high. \"It is like the house left behind made by the microbes,\" VanKranendonk said. \"Scientists used the layers of ash from volcanoes and tiny zircon  with uranium and estimated that they date back to 3.7 billion years ago.\"  The dating seems about right, said Abigail Allwood, a NASA astrobiologist who found the previous oldest fossil, from 3.48 billion years ago, in Australia. But Allwood said she is not completely convinced that what VanKranendonk's team found once was alive. She said the evidence wasn't conclusive enough that it was life and not a geologic quirk . \"It would be nice to have more evidence, but in these rocks that's a lot to ask,\" Allwood said in an email. \n Question: What is Abigail Allwood's attitude towards the newly found fossil? \n Options: (A) Neutral.

But traditionally, the paintings are created to heal a person during a ceremony. The type of image and ceremony used is determined by the disease which the person is suffering from. The sand painting may contain an image of the Holy People. The tribe medicine man may ask the Holy People to help him paint the image and therefore help heal the person in need. When the medicine man finishes painting, he checks its accuracy. The order and the symmetry  of the painting symbolize the harmony which a patient wishes to achieve in his or her life. The accuracy of a sand painting is believed to determine its healing effects. In some cases, more than one sand painting might be used in a healing ceremony. During the ceremony, the person who needs healing will sit on the Native American sand painting. The sand painting serves as an entrance for the spirits and through the painting, the person can absorb the healing energies from these spirits. The sand paintings were not originally meant to be sold or hung on the wall. Once the ceremony is completed, the sand painting must be destroyed, thus allowing the sand to return to the Earth. This is necessary because the sand painting is now seen as poisonous, having absorbed the illness, and must be destroyed. The entire ceremony, from the painting to the destroying is usually completed within a 12-hour period. The medicine man never wrote down how to perform the healing ceremony, but it was passed down from generation to generation. The Pueblo tribe was the first tribe to create Native American sand paintings, but the art soon spread to many other tribes. Today, it is the Navajos who are the most active in creating Native American sand paintings. It is believed that it was a medicine man named Fred Stevens who was the first person to create a Native American sand painting for sale in the 1950s.

She cooked, cleaned and looked after her two small children. Last year, her life took a tragic turn. Her husband died of AIDS; she was found out HIV-positive and her mother-in-law took her children away from her, saying they would get the disease. \"When friends dropped for a visit, she would introduce me, saying, 'She is my son's widow. She has AIDS,'\" said Mala. AIDS is now described as \"explosive \" around the world. A study of a hospital in the port city of Durban in South Africa, where the world's biggest and Africa's second AIDS conference opened last Sunday, found that almost half the beds in medical wards   were occupied by AIDS patients. South Africa has one of the world's fastest growing HIV infections, with 1,700 people infected daily, adding to the 4.3 million, or 10 percent of its population, living with HIV. Until now, Asia has been more successful in holding the AIDS virus than Africa, where the disease has killed about 12 million people. AIDS is now threatening to surround many of Asia's poverty-stricken countries. Countries in Asia, such as Cambodia, and Thailand, have HIV infection speeds over 1 percent. But the low speeds hide huge numbers of infected people, because of the population base. In India, for example, 3.7 million are infected, more than in any other country except South Africa. In China, an estimated 860,000 people (the actual number may be a little larger), mainly drug users, live with HIV/AIDS. Gordon Alexander, a senior advisor for UN AIDS in India, estimates that the number hit by AIDS in Asia will climb about eight million over the next five years from about six million.

Credit cards are the most convenient form of payment, and they are aggressively marketed to college students.Reportedly, a typical college student carries 4.6 credit cards and US $ 3,173 in credit card debt. Credit cards seem to be a fact of life, not just student life. In the long term,  using a credit card properly and paying off the balance can help establish a card history and increase your credit score, which will _ when you need an important loan, for a house or car, for example.Your credit score can affect even unrelated things like insurance rates.Credit cards also offer more protection for users than debit cards .Under federal law, the credit card holder is only responsible for the first US  $ 50in fraudulent  purchases in cases of theft or loss.However, debit card users are responsible for the first US $ 500.

While credit cards offer the easiest access to money, they make it easy to live outside your means.Less than a fifth of students surveyed paid off their balance every month, and carrying a balance brings finance charges, sometimes at a very high interest rates.

West Virginiais one of the heaviest states in the country. About half of its fifth-graders are considered to be overweight, and their parents are worried about that. To get them moving on a healthier path, the state's public schools are using a video game called \"Dance Dance Revolution\".    To use the game, players should stand on a special mat in front of a TV screen. Following arrows on the screen, players must move their feet to the specific symbols on the mat.

Remember there is no such a thing as a wrong way to do this. You might think you've made a mistake, but this gift is part of you, and nothing about that can be a mistake. It's impossible. You get to be all artistic and creative here. You might want to play music in the background. Do whatever you want. The gift is you, so you decide. Remember to say \"I love you\"at the end of your reading. That's like the prize at the end of the book. \n Question: What does the author advise us to do? \n Options: (A) To read a book to our parents in their car (B) To ask our parents to record a book. (C) To make a gift for our parents.

Wikipediais a web-based, free-content encyclopedia   in many languages. SSExploring Wikipedia Many visitors come to Wikipedia to acquire knowledge, while others come to share knowledge. At this very instant, dozens of articles are being improved, and new articles are also being created. Over 3,500 articles have been listed by the Wikipedia community as featured articles. Another 15,000 articles are listed as good articles. Wikipedia is available in more than 280 languages including English. Its related projects include a dictionary, quotations, books, manuals, and scientific reference sources, and a news service. All of these are kept, updated, and managed by separate communities, and often include information and articles that can be hard to find through other common sources. SSBasic navigation in Wikipedia Wikipedia articles are all linked, or cross-referenced. In every article, there are links to some related articles or Wikipedia pages with further in-depth information. Holding the mouse over a certain link will often show to where the link will lead. There are other links towards the ends of most articles, for other articles of interest, related websites and pages and so on. Some articles may also have links to dictionary definitions, audio-book readings, quotations, the same article in other languages etc. SSUsing Wikipedia as a research tool Wiki articles are never considered complete and may be continually edited and improved. Over time, this generally results in an upward trend of quality and a growing agreement over a representation of information. Users should be aware that not all articles are of encyclopedic quality from the start. Indeed, many articles start their lives as displaying a single viewpoint; and, after a long process of discussion, debate, and argument, _ gradually take on a neutral point of view reached through agreement. Others may, for a while, become caught up in a heavily unbalanced viewpoint which can take some time--months perhaps--to achieve better balanced coverage of their subject. SSWikipedia vs. paper encyclopedias Wikipedia has advantages over traditional paper encyclopedias. Wikipedia has a very low \"publishing\" cost for adding or expanding entries and a low environmental impact in some respects, since it never needs to be printed. In addition, Wikipedia has wikilinks instead of in-line   explanations and its articles provide not only summaries but also plenty of details. Additionally, the editorial cycle is short. A paper encyclopedia stays the same until the next edition, while editors can update Wikipedia at any instant, around the clock, to help ensure that articles keep up with the most recent events. \n Question: We know from the passage that Wikipedia  _  . \n Options: (A) provides very accurate information (B) offers links to most leading media (C) covers rich resources of knowledge (D) comes available in any language", "output": "C", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

This has been the first obvious increase since 2001. American schools last fall had 583,000 foreign students. The record is 586,000. That was set in 2002 after many years of gains. But after that the numbers fell. The terrorist attacks on September 11th, 2001 led to more visa   requirements. Now stronger efforts are being made to get more foreign students to study in the United States. China remained in second place in front of South Korea but behind India, whichsent almost 84,000 students last fall. The number of Japanese fell sharply by nine percent, although it remained in fourth place. There were three percent drops from Indonesia and Kenya, the only African country in the top twenty last year. But there were obvious increases from Saudi Arabia, Nepal and Vietnam. The number of Saudi students more than doubled, rising to nearly eight thousand. For a sixth year, the University of Southern California in Los Angeles had the most foreign students. Columbia University in New York was second. Other schools in the top five were New York University, the University of Illinois and Purdue University. Unlike American students in other countries, who often choose history and language study, the leading area of study in the USA was business and management. Second was engineering. The new report also says more than 220,000 Americans studied in other countries. That was during the 2005-2006 school year.

Montana State University scientist Robert Dore has been researching the water in the Pacific Ocean for almost two decades. We've been going to the same spot in the Pacific Ocean, and we try and characterize long-term change in the open ocean environment. And one of the key things that we measure is CO2levels. And we've been able to record this increasing quantity of atmospheric CO2into the ocean. Scientists expected that as atmospheric CO2increased, more and more of the carbon dioxide would be absorbed into the ocean, affecting the chemical balance of the sea water, with a potentially harmful impact on shellfish and coral in particular. \"As carbon dioxide dissolves  in the water, or seawater in this case, it forms a weak acid, carbonic acid,\" Dore explains. \"And therefore, as the concentration of CO2in the atmosphere goes up and that exchanges with the surface seawater, it drives the PH down, and makes it more acidic.\" The seawater Dore and his colleagues have analyzed confirms what the theory predicts. The effect was particular striking at about 250 meters down, and again at 500 meters. Dore and his colleagues came up with two possible explanations. It could be that surface water picked up CO2and then moved to those depths. Or there could be a biological explanation. \"It's important to realize that the oceans are really becoming acidic. And it can have negative  impacts on a whole variety of sea life from fish to coral.

Class, power and status are important in deciding people's rank in society. Class means a person's economic position in society. A commonly used classification is lower class, middle class and upper class. While sociologists disagree on how these terms should be exactly defined, they do describe societies like the United States quite well. One study shows that 53% of Americans belong to the lower class, 46% the middle class, and 1% the upper class. Interestingly, a surgeon earning $500,000 a year and a bus driver earning $50,000 a year both regard themselves as the middle class! Power refers to the amount of control a person has over other people. Obviously, people in positions of great power (such as governors) exercise big power, but people who take orders from others have less power. Power and class do not always go hand in hand, however. For example, the governor of a state has great power, but he or she may not belong to a corresponding  economic class. Generally, however, there is a relationship between power and class. To our knowledge, there aren't too many people who aren't millionaires in the U.S. Senate! Status is the honor or respect attached to a person's position in society. It can also be affected by power and class, but not necessarily so. For example, a university professor may have a high status but not belong to a high social class or have a lot of power over others. \n Question: According to the text, we know that   _  . \n Options: (A) power and class do not always correspond with each other (B) status refers to a person's economic position in society (C) people with high status have a lot of control over others (D) class is less important in deciding a person's social rank", "output": "A", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

Newton was the greatest English mathematician of his generation. His work on optics and gravitation made him one of the greatest scientists the world has even known. Many thought that Newton was born a genius, but he wasn't! When he was young, he did very poorly in grade school, so poor that his teachers became helpless in improving his grades. Beethoven is widely regarded as one of history's great composers. His reputation has inspired composers, musicians and audiences who were to come after him.

Having a smiling face will help your coworkers and supervisors feel better being around you, and you may well end up harvesting the rewards by laughing more in the workplace. But you need to know how to apply humor in your work environment. One of the main rules with humor in the workplace is to avoid argument when you are joking. Stay well away from joking about political affairs , race and religion. Never make fun of other people within your organization, as you are trying to win friends with the people you work with, and not set against them. If you can't help yourself, please be extremely careful. Making jokes about the ups and downs of your trade is a safe way to add wit  to the place of work. You will have the benefit of knowing precisely what your coworkers have to face each and every day, and it's much better as it helps to let go of tensions and lower stress levels by getting them to chuckle  about the situations they come across frequently. The very best time for some humor is when you are not working, but still in the region of the people you work with, such as a coffee or lunch break. You can also make an effort to be funny on the job, but when you are working, it's a good idea to use jokes much more discreetly than you would normally do.

Professor Rongjia Tao of Temple University, Philadelphia unveiled a proposal this week calling for the construction of three 1,000-foot barriers up to 100 miles long, which would act like hill ranges and soften winds before tornadoes could form, the BBC reports. The $16.9 billion plan would call for the faux hill ranges in North Dakota, along the border between Kansas and Oklahoma, and in Texas and Louisiana, ostensibly saving billions of dollars in damage every year, Tao said. The walls would not shelter towns, he said, but instead would soften the streams of hot southern and cold northern air that form tornadoes when they clash in the first place. But critics laughed at Tao's proposals. Leading tornado experts pointed to areas that are already protected by hill ranges the size of the barriers Tao is proposing, yet still have plenty of tornados, like parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas and Missouri. And even if the plan did work, it would create more problems than it would solve, scientists said, by creating catastrophic weather side effects. \"Everybody I know is of 100% agreement - this is a poorly conceived idea,\" Professor Joshua Wurman of the Center for Severe Weather Research. \"From what I can gather his concept of how tornadoes form is fundamentally flawed .

He has discovered that how we deal with money in our daytoday life has more meaning than we usually think. One of the exercises he asked his students to do is to keep record of every penny they spend for a week. From the way they spend their money,they can see what they really value in life. He says our relation with others often becomes clearly defined when money enters the picture. You might have wonderful friendship with somebody and you think that you are very good friends. But you will know him only when you ask him to lend you some money. If he does,it brings something to the relationship that seems stronger than ever before. Or it can suddenly weaken the relationship if he doesn't. This person may say that he has a certain feeling,but if it is not carried out in the money world,there is something less real about it. Since money is so important to us,we consider those who possess a lot of it to be very important. The author interviewed some millionaires   in researching his book. Question:What is the most surprising thing you have discovered about being rich,because you are a selfmade man? Answer:The most surprising thing is how people give me so much respect. I am nothing. I do not know much. All I am is rich. People just have an idea of making more and more money,but what is it for?How much do I need for any given purposes in my life?In his book,the professor uncovered an important need in modern society:To bring back the idea that money is a tool rather than the purpose.

In the computing room, 30 students with sleepy eyes, sit still at their desk, beating the dirty and worn keys. Staring at the colorful screen, they tap continuously for hours. For the other parts in the world, it might be in the middle of the night, nevertheless here time represents nothing. It is an entirely enclosed field. These young computer \"hackers\" are tracing a sort of stimulus  , a drive so exciting and absorbing that it ignores nearly anything else in their lives and becomes the focus of their being. They are addicted   computer programmers. Some of these students have been glued to the console   for no less than twenty hours even with no break for meals or rest. Some have been sleeping on sofas and chairs in the computing room, trying to struggle for a few moments' rest but hating to get too far away from their addicted machines. It is not necessary for most of these students to be at the computing room in the middle of the night. What they are working belong to no assignments. They remain there because they desire to be -- they can not resist the attraction of the computers. Furthermore, they are in groups instead of being alone. There are hackers at computing rooms all over the country. In the unimaginable way, they focus on nothing but computer. They escape from schooling and live beyond friendship; they might have difficulty being employed, choosing to travel from one computing room to another.

As far as I can tell, he's the first American President to have one. That's because the term\"sense of humor\" really wasn't in common usage until the eighteen-sixties and seventies. In the eighteen-forties and fifties, it was called\"the sense of the ridiculous,\" and didn't have the positive connotations that\"sense of humor\" has today. Back then, what was ridiculous was what invited ridicule . Funniness and cruelty went hand in hand. Of course, they still do a lot of arm-in-arm walking in our day as well. Lincoln's humor was very different because, for one thing, it was actually \"humor\"as what the word meant in his time. We don't make the distinction between \"wit \"and \"humor\"anymore; but in the nineteenth century people did. Wit was unpleasant and offensive while humor was pleasant and sympathetic. It's the difference we note now when we distinguish between \"laughing with\" and \"laughing at\". Lincoln was much more about \"laughing with\" than \"laughing at\". And when \"laughing at, \" it was often himself he was teasing. In the famous Lincoln-Douglas debates, when Douglas accused Lincoln of being two-faced, Lincoln replied, referencing his plain looking, \"Honestly, if I were two-faced, would I be showing you this one?\"And, in a way, Lincoln's face itself tells us much about his sense of humor.  You can comb through thousands of photographs of politicians, soldiers, and the like from Lincoln's time and not find a single smile.  True, the long exposures required for photographs of that time made smiling difficult. Yet Lincoln alone, as far as I can tell, overcame that difficulty. Interestingly, while having a sense of humor, or at least the appearance of one provided by comedy writers has become a necessary characteristic for an American President in our time, in the nineteenth century, too much humor was considered problem. And that was the case for Lincoln. A journalist covering the Lincoln-Douglas debates commented that \"I could not take a real personal liking to the man, owing to an inborn weakness. . .that he was extremely fond of jokes, anecdotes and stories.\" \n Question: We rarely see people from Lincoln's time wear smile in their photos because  _  . \n Options: (A) being humorous was considered inappropriate (B) they found it quite funny to smile before camera (C) not smiling for photographs was the fashion (D) photography technology then was not advanced", "output": "D", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

Well, apparently, our general happiness. Psychologists say that what we are called has a direct connection with our well-being  .       Those called Judy and Joshua are the happiest, while Lynn or Ben is likely to be the unhappiest, according to research. Psychologist Dr David Holmes found that this might due to the association that others made with the name. Hearing the name Judy may make them think of actress Judi Dench or TV presenter Judy Finnigan, people who are seen as good natured and happy. On the other hand, people think Paulines are unhappy because of the character Pauline Fowler from the TV programme East Enders. The research claims that this association influences the person with the name and so their personality becomes shaped to fit it. Dr David Holmes said, \"This also has some relation with the original meaning of the name. For example, the original meaning of Judy is 'praised'.\"      Certain names also work well in certain aspects of life. In the workplace Richard and Judy are happiest, while those called Ruth and Carly are happiest in relationships. At the other end of the scale the unhappiest workers are Stuart and Liz, with the unhappiest in relationships being Frank and Harriet.         Dr Holmes said, \"The relation we have with certain names, particularly important namesakes , also shapes how we see ourselves and so may have an effect on our confidence. Names are like product brands in having a powerful effect on attitudes and should therefore be chosen with care.\"       \"Other names are connected with being brave, outgoing or serious.

On my 13th birthday, I bought a poster of Harvard to hang in my room. Being at Harvard became what I dreamt about: I saw myself attending class in Sanders Theater, studying in Widener Library and eating in Annenberg Hall. Even when my electricity was cut off and I woke up at 5:30 a.m. to pitch blackness, I knew that my poster of Harvard was still hanging only two feet away from me. I'd begin my day by asking myself these two questions, \"What do I want in my life?\" and \"Are the things I am doing today going to get me closer to that life?\" Reminding myself of my goal each day made it easy to say no to the same choices I saw my peers making, because those paths wouldn't have gotten me closer to my goal. I found that even poverty could not take away my power to decide what I choose to do with my day. Asking myself those questions gave me the courage to cold email about 50 Harvard students so I could ask for feedback  on my application essays; it gave me the energy to study just one more hour on my SATs when my friends were asleep; and it gave me the determination to submit  just one more scholarship application when 180 0thers had already turned me down.

As he turned a corner, he heard a slight rustling sound -- it might be a cat, it could even be a dog, although few dogs wandered about at night. Rider saw nothing. A cat then?

A policeman who stopped to light a cigarette seemed the most unsuspicious policeman in the world. There was still no sound. There were bushes in the garden of the house where Rider had first heard it and he knew that a man could hide there out of sight. But if he went back, it would warn any such man.

It was not until my junior year in high school that I developed an interest, love, and skill for writing poetry. Back in elementary school, I love to write stories. I would write stories on post-it notes and anywhere I could. Yet when I had to write a limerick  for an assignment, I could not wrap my head around poetry. I had a very hard time figuring out how to rhyme words and have the words make sense. I eventually tossed the paper with the attempted limerick in the trash. I did not try my hand at poetry again until several years later. Many years later in my freshman year of high school, my English teacher gave my class a poetry project as an assignment. I still remember my limerick assignment and was afraid of doing the poetry. For the project, we had to analyze a poem and write a response to it. I choose to respond to Robert Frost's poem Fire and Ice. I also wrote my own poem first. I become really excited when writing the poem. Two years later, I started writing poetry, as a hobby and for fun. To learn how good or bad my poems were, I handed them in to some magazines and contests. I won second place in the North Carolina Poetry Society's Sherry Pruitt Award Contest with a poem called The Ocean, and had my two poems published as high merit   poems. I have continued to write poetry, and have even self-published three collections of poetry in both print and e-book formats, which can be found at my store on Lulu.

You can buy sets of cards, or make your own, and carry them with you wherever you go. There's no question this is useful and because you can use them in short bursts, it's not too much for you. It can be fun. I don't recommend drilling for hours at a time with flashcards. If you want to use flashcard software, things get even better. There are many packages out there for maintaining and drilling flashcards. I recommend VTrain though there are many others. One stands out, however: SuperMemo. Similar to Pimsleur, SuperMemo is engineered according to a carefully researched methodology   in order to test you on a card the very minimum number of times you need to see it for it to stick. When you look at a card, you give some feedback to the software on whether you got it right and how easy you found it. It uses this information, and that of your previous attempts, to decide when you will be shown the card next. It's smart and it really works. If you're like me, the news is even better! I have a version of SuperMemo that runs on my PalmOS phone. Wherever I am, if I have my phone handy, I have thousands of flashcards with me too.

Unlike the other disciplines ,philosophy cannot be defined by what you study, because it is actually unlimited. Anything can be the subject matter of philosophy: art, history, law, language, literature, mathematics, medicine, psychology, religion, science, and values. Philosophy is one of the world's oldest subjects of study, and in fact, the other academic disciplines are directly related to philosophy. For this reason you get a Doctorate  of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in biochemistry, or computer science, or psychology. Two broad sub-fields of philosophy are logic and the history of philosophy. Logic is the science of argument and critical thinking. It provides sound methods for distinguishing good from bad reasoning. The history of philosophy involves the study of major philosophers and periods in the development of philosophy. Of what use is philosophy? First it is useful in educational advancement. It is necessary for understanding other disciplines.  Only philosophy questions the nature of the concepts used in a discipline, and its relation to other disciplines. And through the study of philosophy, one develops sound methods of research and analysis that can be applied to any field. There are a number of general uses of philosophy. It strengthens one's ability to solve problems, to communicate, to organize ideas and issues, to persuade, and to take what is the most important from a large quantity of data.These general uses are of great benefit in the career field, not necessarily for obtaining one's first job after graduation, but for preparing for positions of responsibility, management and leadership later on. It is very short-sighted after all, to take a course of studies only for the purpose of getting one's first job. The useful skills developed through the study of philosophy have significant long-term benefits in career advancement. No other discipline systematically follows the ideals of wisdom, leadership, and capacity to resolve human conflict. \n Question: With the study of philosophy, you can  _  . \n Options: (A) become a great leader (B) succeed in everything (C) find a good job soon after graduation (D) make progress in your career development", "output": "D", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

But Italian artist Maurizio Savini prefers to use bright pink gum--after it has been chewed. Savini makes huge sculptures of bears and even people out of used chewing gum. Each sculpture requires thousands of pieces of gum. \"I like to use chewing gum because it seemed to me a material that can be used in many ways compared with those used by the conventional arts such as painting,\" Savini says. How does he do it? The process is a lot like working with clay. \"I work the chewing gum when it is warm and shape it with a knife,\" says Savini. Then, he puts a chemical onto each gum sculpture to make the gum stay in place. Savini's sticky art has been shown in cities like London, Paris, and Rome, where he lives today. Savini isn't the only artist to work with gum. His pink sculptures have inspired artists all over the world to get creative with the sticky matter. London artist Ben Wilson paints small paintings onto flat pieces of chewed gum he finds stuck to streets and sidewalks.

They recently set out around the world in search of those and other long-missing amphibians. An amphibian is an animal that spends part of its life in water and part on land. Frog, toads , and salamanders are amphibians. The experts are looking for about 100 species. They are searching at least 14 countries on five continents. They will look for the salamander in North America. They hope to find the scarlet frog in South America. They're also looking for species in Africa, Asia and Australia. Scientists are hopeful that they'll find the amphibians--and soon! If the creatures are out there, they may need help. Many amphibians are endangered. The animals face many dangers including pollution and diseases. People cut down the forests where they live. \"If researchers can find the missing creatures, they might be able to figure out how to save them,\" explains expert Robin Moore.

Nor is it a squirrel, or a mouse. It's definitely a rodent  , and it's also a brand-new family of mammals. The locals of the Southeast Asian country of Laos call the creature a kha-nyou (ga-nyou). The kha-nyou have long body hair, short legs, and a hairy tail less thick than a squirrel's. They're vegetarians living in the rocky hills of Laos, and they come out at night, but for more information, you'll have to ask the Lao people. \"It was for sale on a table next to some vegetables. I knew immediately it was something I had never seen before,\" said Robert Timmins, a researcher for the Wildlife Conservation Society. Timmins was working in Laos to stop people from selling endangered animals when he spotted the species. Criminals who trade illegal wildlife can make a lot of money, but they also push the animals closer to disappearing from the planet. The kha-nyou live in karsts, or rough rock. Mark Robinson, a scientist with the World Wildlife Foundation, set out with Lao villagers to find a few more of the rodents for study. They climbed onto a karst, trapped with rice, and caught several. \"To find something so unusual in this day and age is just extraordinary,\" said Timmins. \"For all we know, this could be the last remaining animal family left to be discovered.\" It's a big deal to discover an entirely new family of animals. Humans, for instance, belong to the same family as great apes, chimpanzees, and gorillas. So even though kha-nyous look like rats, they're really very different.

Seeds of some vegetables and crops are a lot luckier than you, as they have travelled to space and back. China is among the three countries in the world that carry out agricultural research in space. The others are Russia and the US. Since 1987, China has sent about 1,000 species of seeds into space. These include green peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers  , carrots, lettuce and wheat. Even on China's first manned spacecraft Shenzhou-V, there were some seeds from Taiwan. \"Conditions in outer space such as radiation and low gravity can cause big changes in the seeds,\" said Chinese researcher Jin Xing. But not all seeds are better after going to space. After returning to Earth, the best seeds are selected.These seeds produce much more and also grow faster than normal seeds. As the safety of genetically modified   food is still being debated, some people doubt the safety of these \"space vegetables\" because some of their genes are changed during the trip to space. But Jin holds a more positive view. He said, \"unlike genetically modified crops, no new genes are introduced to the space vegetables, so they are definitely safe.\" China has also been co-operating with NASA to grow some super size potatoes on the International Space Station. Special growth rooms use computers to control the light, temperature and humidity  . Using this technology a new, virus-free potato can be produced every 40 to 50 days instead of the previous yearly crop. \n Question: Which of the following countries hasn't carried out agricultural research in space up to the present? \n Options: (A) China.

On the same day and only hours before the Holy Father left us, a friend of mine named Veronica McBride died of cancer in a small Wisconsin city. My friend Veronica was 52 years old. She was an attractive, humorous young woman who, as the saying goes, \"never married\". She published several humor books with her mother, Mary McBride. She enjoyed traveling, and for years sent Christmas card photos of herself standing beside monuments or odd animals. She fought cancer for five years. She joked about her treatment keeping her pretty because it kept her thin, and told me she didn't mind losing her hair because of . \"I get to wear nice wigs!\" The last time I saw Veronica was when I visited her family on a sunny day in August in 2003.

In the digital age, selfies have taken off in a way that no one could have predicted. The art of the selfie is one that lots of people have practiced and perfected in recent years. A recent study shows 91 percent of teens have posted a photo of themselves online. Some celebrities   are regular selfie posters, too. It seems that selfies are more than just a trend. They are here to stay. Why are selfies so popular? The appeal of selfies comes from how easy they are to create and share. And posting selfies is popular for another reason: you can control your own image. \"I like having the power to choose how I look,\" admits Samantha, a 19-year-old girl from Missouri, \"even if I'm making a face.\" Actually, the most common selfie is the one where you look cute, partly because it's a quick way to get positive comments about your appearance. \"If I feel pretty, I take one,\" says Andrew, a 23-year-old girl from Maryland, \"when other people Like   it, it's a mini boost of confidence.\" Sure, showing off a new coat or that you're at a cool event is fun, but can be a trap to fall in. There's a danger that your self-respect may start to be tied to the comments and Likes you get when you post a selfie, and they aren't based on who you are--they are based on what you look like. Seeking validation   is totally normal, and it's a healthy way for teenagers to develop their identity. But with social networks, where it's easy to get quick approval almost constantly, the selfie thing can quickly go out of control. It may even start to feel like an addiction: when you get a \"LIKE\", you're up. But when you get nothing, your confidence can decrease quickly. Overall, opinions vary on selfie culture. It's up to you to shape the future of the habit. Ask yourself: are my selfies for fun, or do I need the comments? If you belong to the latter, it's recommended that you change your view. That could mean cutting selfies out entirely or just cutting down and making them more fun. So maybe you like to travel, or read or dance, or create crazy 3-D nail art...post them!

After some years, the family took their bull away. They cut the chain, leaving the loop around the tree and one link hanging down. Then one year, agricultural disaster struck Michigan in the form of Dutch Elm Disease. All of the elms lining the road leading to the farm became infected and died. Everyone thought that the old elm would be the next. The farm owners considered doing the safe thing: pulling it out and cutting it up into firewood before it died. But they simply could not bring themselves to do it. It was as if the old tree had become a family friend. So they decided to let nature take its course. Amazingly, the tree did not die. Nobody could understand why it was the only elm still standing in the county! Plant experts from Michigan State University came out to observe the tree. They observed the scar left by the iron chain, now almost completely covered by bark. The experts decided that it was the chain that saved the elm's life. They reasoned that the tree must have absorbed so much iron from the chain that it became immune to the virus. It's said that what doesn't kill you will make you stronger. Or, as Earnest Hemingway put it, \"Life breaks us all, but afterwards, many of us are strongest at the broken places.\" \n Question: What did the family do with the elm when the agricultural disaster hit Michigan one year? \n Options: (A) They invited plant experts to observe it.

Experts say that the industry has grown because traditional social ties have weakened. Many young people leave behind a close community of friends and family to find work in bigger cities.

Since the 56-foot whale was the largest whale ever beached onTaiwan's shores, scientists wanted to study it and perform an autopsy for educational purpose.

When things rot, they give off gases as a by-product. In the whale's case, the gases were trapped in its belly.

This was the first step in a long series of developments that eventually resulted in hamburger as we know it today.    German sailors picked up the raw meat delicacy   in their contacts with Russians and brought it back to their home port of Hamburg. But the people there were unused to eating raw meat , so they broiled   the outside of the Russian steak; thus the hamburger steak was born.    The hamburger steak was brought ot America in the nineteenth century immigrants. Louis Lasssen, a cook in New Haven, Connecticut, modified  the hamburger steak by sandwiching it between two pieces of  bread. But the true American hamburger came into existence in St. Louis at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in 1904. A harried cook at the fair quickly slapped broiled beef patties between buns and served them to a demanding crowd, which gulped them down joyously.  At first this new food creation was made from scraps of poorer cuts of meat that were not used for anything else, but before scrapes were not enough.

Many of these customs tell stories about animals taking the teeth. For example, Koreans have the custom of throwing the fallen tooth onto the roof of a house so that a magpie   can take the tooth away and bring a new tooth for the child. This custom is also followed by some other Asian countries, such as Japan and Vietnam. Other countries, though, have tooth customs about other animals. In Mexico and Spain, for example, it is thought that a mouse takes a fallen tooth away and leaves some money. But in Mongolia, it is dogs that take children's teeth away. Dogs are highly respected in Mongolian culture. It is believed that the new tooth will grow strong if the baby tooth is fed to a dog, so parents in Mongolia will put their children's fallen teeth in a piece of meat and feed it to a dog. In France and the USA, a child will put a fallen tooth under his or her pillow before going to bed. It is thought that in the early morning, when the child is still sleeping, the Tooth Fairy will take the tooth away and leave something else under the pillow. What she will leave is hard to know.

After all, everyone in my family used the word quite naturally, and we understood each other. So far as I knew, it was a word like any other word  -- like bath, orchocolate, orhomework. But it was my homework which led to my discovery thatgrinnieswas a word not known outside my family. My last report card had said that I was a \"C\" student in English, and my parents, both teachers, decided that no child of theirs would be just an average student of anything. So nightly I spelled words aloud and answered questions about the fine points of grammar. I wrote and rewrote and rewrote every composition until I convinced my mother that I could make no more improvements. And the hard work paid off. One day the teacher returned compositions, and there it was -- a big fat, bright red \"A\" on the top of my paper. Naturally, I was delighted, but I didn't know I was attracting attention until the teacher spoke sharply, \"Helen, what are you doing?\" Called suddenly out of my happy thoughts, I said \"Oh, I've got the grinnies!\" The teacher and my classmates burst into laughter, and then I understood that grinnies were used inside my family. Other people were not so lucky. And it is really lucky to have the grinnies, an uncontrollable, natural state of great pleasure. Grinnies are shown on the outside by sparkling eyes and a wide, wide smile -- not just any smile, but one that shows the teeth and stretches the mouth to its limits. A person experiencing the grinnies appears to be all mouth. On the inside grinnies are characterized by a feeling of joyful anxiety. Grinnies usually last just a few seconds, but they can come and go. Sometimes, when life seems just perfect, I have occasional attacks of the grinnies for a whole day. The term originated in my mother's family. Her younger sister, Rose, who had deep dimples  , often expressed her pleasure with such a grin that the dimples appeared to become permanent. When Rose was about four, she started explaining her funny look by saying, \"I have the grinnies\". The term caught on, and it has been an important word in our family now for two generations. The occasion doesn't matter. Anything can bring on the grinnies -- just so long as one feels great delight. When my brother finally rode his bicycle -- without training wheels -- from our house to the corner and back, he came home with the grinnies. When I was little, my mother's announcement that we would have homemade ice cream for dessert always gave me the grinnies. My father had the grinnies when I was chosen to make a speech at the end-of-school-year ceremony. Grinnies can be brought on by a good meal, a sense of pride, a new friend, a telephone call from someone special, an achievement. Or sometimes one gets the grinnies for no reason at all: just a sudden sense of happiness can bring on a case. Whatever brings them on, an attack of the grinnies is among life's greatest pleasures. In fact, now that I look back on the experience, I feel sorry for my seventh-grade teacher. I think it's a pity that she didn't know the word grinnies. It's such a useful term for saying, \"I'm really, really pleased!\" \n Question: After the writer was twelve years old, she   _  . \n Options: (A) thought everyone knew the meaning of \"grinnies\" (B) equaled \"grinnies\" to bath or chocolate in meaning (C) got to know \"grinnies\" was used only inside her family (D) discovered the word \"grinnies\" through her mother", "output": "C", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

Still, every year or so, someone takes me aside and says, \"You actually are polite, aren't you?\" I'm always thrilled. They noticed. That's the thing. Actually, when we talk about politeness, we usually think of please; thank you; I like your hat; etc. All we need to do is to hear, not to notice. When I was in high school, I read etiquette manuals . No one noticed my politeness except for one kid. He yelled at me about _ . \"It's strange that you are always so polite,\" he said. I took that as praise and made a note to hide my politeness further. Real politeness, I believed, was invisible . It adapted itself to the situation. Politeness leaves door open. I've met so many people whom, if I had trusted my first impressions, I would never have wanted to meet again. Yet many of them are now great friends. One of those people is my wife. On our first date, she told me in detail that she had an operation to remove a cyst  from her body. Of course, it killed the chemistry. But when I walked her home, I told her I'd had a great time. We talked a little after that. I kept everything pleasant and brief. Much later, I learned that she'd been having a very bad day in a very bad year. People silently suffer from all kinds of terrible things. The good thing about politeness is you can regard these people exactly the same and wait to see what happens. You don't have to have an opinion. You don't need to make a judgment. Last week, my two-year-old son, Abraham met a foreign woman in the playground. Out of curiosity, I suppose, he asked, \"What's your name?\" The woman told him. Then he put out his little hand and said, \"Nice to meet you!\" Everyone laughed and he smiled. He shared with his firmest handshake, like I taught him. \n Question: Why do many people think the author is impolite? \n Options: (A) Because he doesn't look polite.

Researchers have found a way to use the phone's camera to detect the microorganism in the patient's blood that causes the disease. According to the World Health Organization, almost 600,000 people died of malaria in 2013, making this mosquito-borne disease one of the deadliest in the world. The saddest aspect of this calamity  is that it affects mostly young children. Early detection of the infection is important for successful treatment. But since the first symptoms resemble ordinary flu, a microbiologist must look at a drop of a patient's blood under a microscope for a proper diagnosis. Scientists in Britain have now developed a smart phone attachment called Xrapid, that turns the phone into a 200-power microscope, while the attached app---based on facial recognition software - quickly detects the parasitic protozoa in the blood smear . Jean Viry-Babel is the CEO of IanXen, the company that developed the app. He says it is cheap and works on the spot. \"So we take a high-definition picture of a sample of blood. We separate the red blood cells from the rest---the white blood cells, the platelets ---and we start looking at each of the red blood cells individually,\" said Viry-Babel. Viry-Babel says the app is affordable, easy to use and provides reliability of up to 98 percent. The only additional equipment required is an ordinary glass lab slide - called a \"slate.\" \"There's only one button, which is called \"Diagnose\". So you put it on the slate and you put it on the dried blood, and you press diagnose and it tells you yes or no,\" he said. Researchers say the field-testing of the device will begin in January and February in Tanzania, Benin and Indonesia --- while commercial use is scheduled to start by the end of March. They also plan to expand the versatility of the new device---teaching it to recognize other diseases, such as tuberculosis and Lyme Disease. \n Question: The text is meant to  _  . \n Options: (A) find a new way to treat malaria.

I started by being grateful for all I do have, like great health, a stable family, a steady income, freedom, a decent home, the ability to see the trees turn orange in the fall, to hear my grandson humming in the back seat, to remember the great times I've had in my life.

Instead of heading off to college, the high school graduate packed her bags for a Bengali jungle. Lutz, like a growing number of other young Americans, is taking a year off. Gap  years  are quite common in Britain and Australia, but they are just beginning to catch on in the U.S. Lutz, who grew up in Boulder, Colo., has put together a 14-month schedule that includes helping deliver solar power to some communities in India and interning   for a fashion designer in Shanghai---experiences that are worlds away from the lecture halls and university dormitories that await other students. \"I could not be happier,\" she says. Why are students attracted to the gap-year concept? According to new survey data from Karl Haigler and Rae Nelson, education-policy experts and co-authors of The Gap-Year Advantage, the most common reason for this is to avoid burnout. \"I felt like I was focused on college as a means to an end,\" says Kelsi Morgan, an incoming Middlebury College freshman who spent last year interning for a judge in Tulsa, Okla., and teaching English at an orphanage in the Dominican Republic. The hope is that after a year out of the classroom, students will enter college more energized, focused and mature. That can be an advantage for colleges too. Robert Clagett, dean of admissions at Middlebury, did some research a few years ago and found that a single gap semester was the strongest predictor of academic success at his school. Most experts recommend securing a spot in college before taking a gap year and warn against using the time off to lengthen your resume. \"Most admissions folks can see right through that,\" says Jim Jump, the academic dean of St. Christopher's School in Richmond, Va. But for students like Lutz, who, after getting rejected from five Ivies, decided to take time off, a gap year can help focus interests. Lutz now plans to apply mostly to non-Ivies that have strong marketing programs. \"This experience has really opened my eyes to the opportunities the world has to offer,\" she says. But at least one education expert doesn't want schools spreading the gap-year message. In a study that followed 11,000 members of the high school class of 1992 for eight years after graduation, Stefanie DeLuca, a sociology professor at Johns Hopkins University, found that, all things being equal, those who delayed college by a year were 64% less likely to complete a bachelor's degree than those who didn't. DeLuca did not say whether these students voluntarily started college late, but at the very least, her work indicates that taking a gap year doesn't guarantee success. \"I'm not going to say that time off does not have benefits,\" says DeLuca. \"But I think we should not be so enthusiastic.\" \n Question: The students take gap years mainly because   _  . \n Options: (A) they want to be more unusual (B) they want to refresh themselves (C) some experts advise them to do so (D) their parents think it good for them", "output": "B", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank and four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\").

In winter, with its cloudy days and bitter cold, we dream of those days at the beach, lying on the sand and enjoying the bright and burning sun. And then, summer comes, and it rains. As a child, I would wake up to rainy summer days and come close to crying. It wasn't fair. We suffered through months of school and experienced bad weather for those short ten weeks of freedom. On those rainy summer days, I had nothing fun to do and could only sit inside, staring out at the rain like a bird in a cage. I was an only child, so there was no one else to play with. My father worked from home, so I was not truly alone, but he could not actively play with me since he was at work. It was those days that I would watch whatever was on television or read any books that I could find lying around. I'd pray each night that the rain would not be there the next day. As an adult, though, my opinion of summer rain has changed. When you have to work every day, summer is not as exciting. Everything seems uninteresting. Such a mindset makes you cheer for anything new or different. I spend the winter dreaming of summer and the summer dreaming of winter. When summer comes, I hate how hot it is. And then I look forward to the rain, because the rain brings with it a cold front, which makes me comfortable. Rainy days are still the worst days of the summer, but summer rain today means positively beautiful -- and quite cooler -- weather tomorrow. \n Question: When the author was a child, he   _  . \n Options: (A) liked staying indoors (B) hated rainy days (C) dreamed on summer days (D) preferred cooler weather", "output": "B", "category": "Question Answering 937.json"}]
