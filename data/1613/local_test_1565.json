That is clearly your meaning, as sinful people are the tools of Satan, not inanimate objects. Perhaps you did not understand the Bible where Jesus states that it is not what goes in our mouths that defiles us, but the words that come out of our mouths. This demonstrates that it is not food that is bad (or particular foods), but the hurtful words from our hearts. Similarly, it is not firearms that are bad, but the way some people may use them to hurt innocent people. Are AR-15s bad in the hands of police who use them to stop a terrorist in Dallas, or is it the terrorist himself who is using one to kill police while they protect Black Lives Matter demonstrators? God hates evil actions and thoughts, not inanimate objects. And the law being broken is one made by our clueless legislators, not one made by God. They should rescind that law so they will not have to charge the Reverend or any other good citizen.", "output": "Non-insult", "category": "Toxic Language Detection 956.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms.
