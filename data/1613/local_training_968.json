It was a little old which made some of it feel run down compared to others out there but you just have to remember that it is older if not one of the first. My friend did not seem to enjoy its charm like I did saying it was too dirty and she will not return there. The beds were clean but like I said everything was just older. Every employee I spoke to was really nice. It is right on the strip. They have great shops inside their hotel which is nice. Plenty of parking and it is not massively huge like the other hotels. I did not get a chance to experience the pool but hopefully I will some day. The prices for per night were very reasonable especially for being on the strip. We only did a bit of gambling here because I spent most of my time in the TCBY - heck yeah. \\n\\nSo if you are not all concerned about the age of the hotel or having the check in counters made out of marble and are looking for a good deal on the strip then I say give this place a try.

You could walk in easily find a cart, they have wide aisles and plenty of selection. However the meats are poorly cut-a rookie or inexperienced butcher I presume. Of course the prices were a little cheaper than Vons,Smiths or Wal-mart BUT now they have remodeled and the prices are no longer LESS, there are tons of people every time you go and long lines, broken carts and the produce is lackluster at best. Lots of little Mexican kids running unattended throughout the store and when you finally go to get out of there there's usually 1 or if your lucky 2 cashiers. The belts are always dirty & sticky and you have to bag your own shit while a mentally challenged employee stands by and stares into space. Never any help bagging and definitely nobody to assist you to the car which explains why you never see elderly people here. On one occasion I saw a homeless lady walking through the store and when we were in the parking lot 2 employees came out after her and tackled her to the ground claiming she had shoplifted-very unprofessional. \\nIf you like rubbing elbows with illegals and bums to wait forever to buy overpriced below average quality stuff-this is probably your store of choice.", "output": "1 star", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 418.json"}, {"instruction": "You are given a review about a place.

The restaurant has a location down the street called Les Deux that you can use for private events: birthday parties, receptions, or in my case a rehearsal dinner.  My now husband and I had dined at the restaurant several times and were in need of a venue for our rehearsal dinner and since this was close to our wedding venue in Phoenix, we decided to use Coup Des Tartes.  The planning went well, we picked out a menu and were able to drop off the wine the day before the dinner.  \\n\\nSo, why 2 stars you ask?  Well it was what happened that night before our rehearsal dinner that ruined this place for us.  I got an email less than 24 hours before our dinner asking if they could move us to a smaller space at the restaurant, Rende-Vous, instead of Les Deux.  The reason we booked the place down the street is because we had too many people for the other room.  The weather called for rain and someone had booked the smaller room and patio for an event (when you book the room and patio, it can hold more people than we had for our event), so they wanted to give them Les Deux and put us in the smaller room.  The night before a wedding is not the right time to ask this question - but honestly, even a week before wouldn't be the right time to ask this question.  I had no desire to have an event outside in the cold which is why I booked an enclosed location from the start.  The restaurant offered a $100 gift card if we would make the change.  $100 would hardly even begin to compensate us for the inconvenience.  We would have needed to inform all guests of the change as I had printed out information for all out of town guests with details on where to be and when.  We stayed firm and said we wouldn't move.  I did receive a sincere apology from one person at the establishment, but the coordinator offered an apology with an excuse which for me is unacceptable.  You messed up, you know it, so just own it and apologize.  \\n\\nThe dinner went off at the original location that we reserved, but I am still irritated to this day that they even asked to move us.  I think they were more concerned with pleasing a bigger party that would bring in more money, than taking care of the customers that booked the room.  We haven't been back to the restaurant since and I doubt we will ever return, which is quite unfortunate because they do make great food.  Bad service wil ruin it for a place though and sadly that is what happened to us.", "output": "2 stars", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 418.json"}, {"instruction": "You are given a review about a place.

It was an absolute pleasure to work with them. \\n\\nIn short, Just-in Time was: ON TIME, PROFESSIONAL, COURTEOUS, FAST, WELL-PREPARED\\n\\nAndy and I discussed the move over email when I filled out a contact form. He responded same day and was prompt with all future correspondence. Pricing was upfront -- I paid $103/hr for a 3-person crew which I believe is a discount since my move was scheduled for Monday: Monday through Thursday are discounted from $119/hr (I think) to $103/hr. There was also a one-hour trip charge for $103. They brought all blankets, tape, and shrink-wrap. They even had tools to dissemble my furniture and assemble it at my new place.\\n\\nAndy communicated with me a few days before my move date to confirm and communicated with me throughout the day on the scheduled move date to keep me updated of any time changes. (The move was scheduled for 11AM but the crew had a bigger job so it pushed back to 12:30. I had the option for another crew at our originally scheduled time but I was running late so it worked out perfectly). \\n\\nThe crew was very fast, kind, and did not damage any of my items. The crew shrink  wrapped furniture and packed up my flat panels with extra care. They were willing to disassemble and assemble all of my furniture but I declined just to save some time.  The crew did disassemble assemble some items and took the time to do a perfect job. \\n\\nI estimated $500 for my move -- about 4 hours + 1 hour trip time -- and they completed the job in 2.5 hours and the final bill came to $360. \\n\\nAndy is very fair with the quote process. If you are up front and open with him about what you have and how ready you will be -- i.e. boxed vs. loose items -- I believe your final bill will be extremely close if not exact. There were no added fees or surprises for the final bill. \\n\\nNow, the crew did say I was especially ready for the move: most of my items were in boxes and color coded for the rooms. So, I don't want everyone to think they are going to pay less than what they are quoted.

Won't ever ask for dessert again.\\n\\nJerk chicken - 1\\nDessert - 0\\n\\nMy second visit, I got to the fish: steamed snapper, fried tilapia.  Both were decent dishes.  The snapper was a whole fish made to order and cost \\\"market price,\\\" the tilapia was prix fixe and served as small lightly breaded filets.  \\n\\nI also requested a veggie stew which the cook made fresh from carrots, cabbage, and coconut milk.  It was creamy, perfectly spicy (not burning), and tasted wonderful.  Home run.\\n\\nTilapia - 1\\nVeggie stew - 1\\n\\nThe price wasn't so wonderful though.  I asked to substitute stewed veggies for the prepared steamed veggie side.  Nope - apparently we were on different menus, I was later told that the stew is a separate dish.  So I gave up $20 for the tilapia and veggie stew.  It's all right though, I made two meals out that portion.

I had this perception as many others have had that taking certain courses at a junior college level would be somewhat easier than that of a university, namely math and science type courses. I was clearly mistaken and earned a new respect for math courses taught at MCC. \\n\\nOne fall semester apart from my 15 credits at ASU, I also took two additional courses at MCC, a Calculus I class and a technical writing course. I was blessed to be in a Calc. I course taught by a Prof. Santini who began the class with... \\\"are you guys ready to get on the Santini roller coaster of fun?!?\\\" upon hearing that I knew it would be an interesting semester. To say the least, it was more than interesting, although I barely passed, this guy knew his calculus, he had the passion and he instilled his teaching in that he wanted his students to understand the foundation of calculus, so, for him the basic formulas were meant to be second nature to us. His class wasn't easy, it was one of the most difficult undergrad courses I've taken but at the same time it was the most rewarding. The same went for my technical writing course in which my professor graded our papers to the nth degree. I have to admit that MCC has instructors that are great in what they teach and prepare their students to be competitive at the university level, well, that was my experience.\\n\\nI do admit that this is one of the more crowded and busy junior colleges since it serves as a feeder school to Arizona State plus many of its students, like myself were concurrently enrolled at ASU and MCC. Another lesson learned from MCC was my parking skills. I learned how to be hawkish looking for parking. Since my classes were mainly on the side of campus facing dobson rd, my parking options were limited especially since from mcc i only had 45 mins to drive to ASU, look for parking there and get to class. Even now when I have to go to MCC for something, I still get frustrated looking for parking. \\n\\nOverall, MCC offers quality courses taught by pretty good instructors, and I recommend supplementing your schedule by taking courses at MCC if you're already at ASU because whatever your final grade is at MCC you can transfer the grade for credit towards your degree without hurting your cumalitive gpa at ASU.", "output": "4 stars", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 418.json"}, {"instruction": "You are given a review about a place.

Small location in strip mall, which is not a turn off, since we've found excellent food in small, family owned restaurants.

She returned about 5 minutes later with the beer and soda, no pisco sour; and took our food order. We asked for the yuca huancaina as the appetizer, 2 cevices and 1/4 grilled chicken.  Out came the yuca, a small portion considering the price, but ok. Still no pisco sour...when we asked the waitress, she said the gentleman that makes them had stepped out, but we would get our drink as soon as he came back. 25 minutes passed by before one of the ceviches came, then 5 minutes later the chicken. When the second ceviche was brought out 10 minutes AFTER the chicken (I still don't understand why both ceviches weren't served at the same time), the waitress suggested we get something other than the pisco sour.

It was explained that this room would have more space.\\nWe were also offered a special \\\"service\\\".  I forget the name they used but if we used this \\\"service\\\" we would get the satisfaction of being \\\"green\\\".  What was this service?  While we would get extra towels so that they would last us the three days and enough shampoo, soap and T.P, once they stocked our room with these things we would get no maid service.  Our bed would not be made, the bathroom would not be cleaned and the carpet would not be vacuumed. How is this being green?  I'm not sure.  We declined even though the way they tried to make us feel guilty was so endearing and tempting.\\nWe got to our room to discover that we had what looked like a full size bed.  I'm pretty sure it would've been physically impossible for the room to be any smaller: take one step and there's the bed, a step to the right and stub your toe on the desk. Turn around and stub your toe on the oversize chair almost obscuring the TV.  I cant' even picture how small the \\\"cozy\\\" room must be (I suspect it does not even exist and they tell everyone they have been \\\"upgraded\\\")\\nWe called the desk to let them know that we had booked a king size bed and that's what we wanted.  We were informed that we were wrong but if we wanted to upgrade to a king size we would have to take the only one left  in the whole hotel which was booked to capacity and which was on the third floor and this was not recommended as the noise from the bar would be unbearable.  Would we like to check the third floor? Before going downstairs to check the room my husband looked at the confirmation email which clearly stated we had booked a king size bed.

After walking the strip for the past few hours  we kept smelling that damned BBQ so naturally with us being from the south (ATL shawty lol) we opted to eat here and get our 'grub' on.\\n\\nWe chose to sit inside because the restaurant sits literally BTW the boat at T.I. and the boardwalk where everyone walks and I am not a fan of putting on a show while eating. \\n\\nThe guys ordered a pitcher of beer and the girls got either soda or water. I'm assuming the server was new bc it took him forever to bring our drinks (not beer bc I understand that comes from the bar, but 10 min for water and fountain drinks for 4 people in a slow restaurant is not a good look). The bartender ended up taking our orders and waiting on us for the remainder of the meal. I can't recall what everyone else ordered but I think one of the meals might have either been quesadilla (i can never spell that right) or sliders. But 2 of us ordered the short ribs, including myself and man-o-man was that good. \\n\\nThe Shot rib (rib because it was only one, and had I not have had two sides I may have been a little pissed off) was prepared the right way, whichever way that may actually be, but the meat fell off the bone! They had variations of sauces at the table people could choose, don't remember the flavors all to well but they were what I would expect from a west coast Vegas-y restaurant, and with my expectations not being set too high for the sauces to blow my mind, I was pleased. My side dishes consisted of baked beans and mac & cheese. Again, my southern roots didn't sway me to expect them to be like moms homemade dishes, I was fairly pleased with them. I give the place a B- simply because I love BBQ and that particular day we hadn't eaten except maybe once and had walked from PH to the N & S parts of the strip all day so maybe my stomach appreciated the meal more than my taste buds.\\n\\nThe server/bartender whom we saw all of 3 maybe 4 times got the minimum tip from us bc she wasn't as attentive as she could have been esp with it not being crowded at all. And had this not have been Vegas they might not have gotten anything.\\n\\nThe meals are not cheap, but then again what is 'cheap' in Vegas. Even the McDonalds isn't cheap, but one should expect to spend $$$ when you come here for leisure otherwise, why come right? All in all, I would come again if I have the urge for BBQ.

All of a sudden this woman (manager maybe) jumps in and starts talking to me about the packages and how I'm wasting my money.

By the end, our table felt ignored for a good half hour.\\n-the restrooms are pathetic--just sad.\\nThe Ugly:\\n-our waiter tried to overcharge us $270.  When we first got our bill, we noticed that it had three extra dinners on it, along with a 20% tip.  When we were finally able to find our waiter to call him over, he immediately grabbed the bill and said he knew what was wrong and would fix it--without given us even a chance to explain the problem.  He clearly knew the issue beforehand (but hadn't made any effort to come get the bill from us first).  I can assure you that although we tried to find some innocent explanation for his conduct, everyone in our group left with the impression that the waiter had intentionally tried to slip the extra charges by us (since the bill was so large anyway and we had had several glasses of wine by that point).\\nFor the price you pay to eat here, diners should expect and receive top notch service and food.

I have always been a fan of the food truck but found it too taxing to try to figure out where the truck was parked, what time and if there was any food left. So basically FAME is the food court at linq. It's a collection of different vendors like beard papa - they have cream puffs and Boba drinks; pizza buddha; fuku burger and an Asian place with just a Chinese character for a name (see pic ) I have no clue why they call this food court \\\"FAME\\\", is it because they think the eateries here are Famous in their own right??? NOT! I gave it 2 stars coz the couple times we went there the place wasn't packed and had plenty of seats available. Also they had utensils and condiments that u could use on each table. The fountain drinks were also self serve. If not for these I would've given it a 1 star. \\nOk so 1.)\\\"BEARD PAPA\\\" - they are supposedly famous for their cream puffs, I tried the chocolate one with vanilla cream, it was good but no wow factor especially at almost $4 a piece. It wasn't too sweet which is good. I tried their drinks as well, milk tea was good and mango slush was good, the drinks are huge and this is the only size it comes in avg at 10$/ drink. So ya it's going to be a pretty expensive snack! \\n2.) FUKU BURGER - my all time faves have always been the tamago burger, the spicy burger, Naga dog and the togarashi fries. Please note that they cook their burgers medium so If u don't like seeing pink in your burgers u can specify how you want the meat cooked. I am sad to say though that although the food was still good the quality of food I had that day was below par. I had asked for my spicy burger to be medium well, it came out well done, also the fries were a bit on the overcooked side. On top of the food coming out about 20 mins. Later they had shorted us an order of the Katsu burger which he had forgotten to dispute since we were so hungry already and the kids were driving us nuts. So that was $10 for nothing. And yes... the burgers and hot dogs avg at around $10 per item and no fries or drink included, they have fountain drinks available at $10/drink coz it's in a so called \\\"souvenir cup\\\". So better get ur soda elsewhere. So bottom line... was not impressed anymore and got the craving out of my system. \\n3.) \\\"No name chinese/thai/Japanese identity crisis - ish \\\" this is the place that has a Chinese character for a name. I think they did this on purpose so that it's harder to bad mouth and criticize them. So the first time we tried fried rice- which was the only delicious item we tried, but it wasn't even that amazing my standards, definitely not $12 amazing coz that's how much it was for one plate that is good for about 1 1/2 ppl maybe. Shrimp dumplings - the wrapper was too thick and it had 2 tiny pcs. Of shrimp in it which was falling apart when u bit into it. So when u eat it u have to eat it in one big bite and u get a mouth full of the wonton wrapper. Gyozas- wrapper also very thick and the ground pork filling was falling apart as well. UDON SOUP - soup base was a dark brown color and did not taste good at all... at least the noodles were edible. Ramen - the soup tasted fishy and too salty. BBQ pork platter - this one was the worst, it took them almost 1 hour to serve this and when I tried the BBQ pork I had to SPIT IT OUT! it was just nasty! It had a very weird after taste, I could not make myself swallow it in fear that I might regurgitate. The dishes here range from $10-$15 per serving. service was also very slow and they bring ur dishes out at different intervals. This place definitely needs to train the cooks better.\\n\\nSo overall impression of FAME... i love the ambience, but it is way over priced and it feels like all they are after is the consumers money without delivering good quality and service. It's like a Walmart pretending to be a Nordstrom and charging Nordstrom prices. Very slow service, so if you are in a hurry, good luck to you! Very disorganized, also no sink to wash your hands not even hand sanitizer stations. And they expect you to tip them too?

It's a tapas bar after all. I'm a fan of how communal the layout is. In the tradition of everyone sharing food, Firefly has a very intimate feel where you are not necessarily 'packed in', but the feeling of being close to everyone promotes the idea of being 'one' and encouraging the idea of sharing. Sort of like most Ethiopian restaurants- where you're all eating from the same plate and the conversations occur in a very raw, intimate setting.\\n\\nCertainly an 'off strip' gem that is worth checking out.

The last time I stayed here which was about a year ago during CES and the main reason why we picked that place was because the rate was less than $100 a night vs. over $200 in others. \\n\\nOn the second day of my stay, I got back to my room after the show, and I noticed that my favorite bracelet that I left on the counter was gone. I clearly remembered leaving it on the counter, but forgot to put it away before I left the room that morning.  It was definitely the maid or someone got into the room while we were out. I was really upset and filed a report. Unfortunately, once it's lost, it's gone forever. There's close to zero chance of recovering it.  I found out who cleaned the room that day and approached her the next day, but of course she kept repeating the same words - No Bracelet. No, I don't know.   \\n\\nOf course, it's my fault too for leaving a valuable jewelry out on the counter, but it never crossed my mind that someone would actually steal stuff from my hotel room. \\nIronically, I met an older couple in the elevator that very evening, and the husband said that their room got broken into that morning, and someone had somehow opened up their safe and taken over $10K worth of their personal belongings. They didn't seem like a couple that would make up a story like that. But one things' for sure. I'm never staying at the hotel again! \\n\\nEver since that experience, I opted not to have my room cleaned again, and leave the do not disturb sign outside my door.

The place needs a good cleaning and fresh paint- top to bottom.

(yuk...cannot be sanitary) or start applying polish when there's clearly old polish left on the cuticles.

The sauce is a little too sweet for me, but it's good.  \\n\\nI usually get one of the east side pizzas.  These are my favorites because they are made with thicker mozzarella.  Today I had the Spring Street, which is served with ricotta cheese, meatballs, and peppers.  I also like the Bleeker Street (sausage and garlic) and the Mott Street (sausage, peppers, and onions).

I need my daughters Bat Mitzvah to be over before sharing my awful experience with Living Energy.  If you thinking about hiring Living Energy for party planning, DJ services, or lighting, read this review first.\\n\\nI hired Toby to be my party planner.  She had a flat fee contract of $3,500 and she promised to not mark up the contracts that she negotiated on our behalf.  This sounded reasonable to me and I signed the contract.\\n\\nThe initial planning sessions went well.  We picked out a venue for the event and solidified a contract.  Then the pressure started to hire her DJ through Living Energy.  I went to 3 different Mitzvah's to watch their DJ's and ALL the parties were flat and lame.  They tried to make excuses, but their DJ's were terrible!!  Go see them before you hire them!!\\n\\nNot wanting to create an uncomfortable situation, we decided to hire a band - Sapphire Sky (they are amazing!!).  \\n\\nAfter we had picked the venue and the band, now was time for the \\\"event extras.\\\"  These are things like lighting, d\\u00e9cor, a photo station, tattoo artist, airbrush artist, food items, video truck rental, etc.  This is where the real trouble started!!\\n\\nFirst, Toby gave me a RIDICULOUS contract for lighting through none other than Living Energy.  It was $5,000 more than I ended up spending and she put a heavy pressure on me to sign the contract.  Then came the contracts for the photo station and airbrush artist.  All were around $1,000 more than I ended up spending for her \\\"preferred vendors.\\\"  Then came the d\\u00e9cor package - another $3,000 more than I ended up spending.\\n\\nI sat down with her and told her that the total cost was not in my budget.  I looked at each item and asked simple questions like ...\\\"Why does an airbrush artist cost $450 and hour without supplies??\\\"  \\n\\nFinally, I went around her and called my the companies on my own, and found out that she was dramatically marking up the prices on EVERY ITEM!!!  I have no proof that she was getting a kick-back from these companies, but I can tell you that I ended up with more services and saved over $14,000 from her original contracts.  Needless to say, as soon as I told her that I was not using Living Energy for the lighting or her other vendors, she fired me.\\n\\nMy question is this ... If Toby made her money from her $3,500 planning fee and did not mark up other contracts, why would she fire me for negotiating contracts on my own??  \\n\\nI strongly recommend that people planning their child's Bar or Bat Mitzvah spend a few minutes and check the sanity of the pricing that they get from Living Energy.  They are not honest and their DJ quality is lacking.\\n\\nI am happy to help anyone planning a with the vendors that I used.

Having stayed at many Las Vegas hotels I would say I would stay here again if I needed to be budget conscious, however, not if I was looking for amenities and service. \\n\\nWe arrived at the hotel a little after 1 in the afternoon and waited in a small line, with no organization what so ever. We had two rooms and asked if they could be next to each other.  She was able to place us across the hall from each other. Perfect! The first room was done and she was charging the second room when my credit card wouldn't process. This didn't make any sense because there was a thousand dollars available and they were only charging $150 for the remaining balance. I proceeded to give her two other cards which she could not process either (which by the way were able to be used every where else for the remainder of the weekend) and finally just had to give her cash to get things over with.  When I got back home after that weekend it turned out she had charged me $800 for the first room.\\n\\nOne room had a view of the pool and the other room of the parking lot. I choose the one with the pool of course! They have a dj during the day so you can hear music playing but not too loud in the room that you can't sleep in or take a nap.  Decent sized room and a typical bathroom.  Clean and very acceptable, especially for the price.  Luckily, they had a ihome system because we had forgotten speakers for our ipod.  Pretty satisfied for $250 for two nights but then I went to wash my hands and the sink is leaking all over.  I immediately called maintenance and they said they would send someone right up. We needed ice for our drinks so we went to the ice machine and it was broken so we had to go to the next floor.  This ended up being a hassle later in the night when 2 of the other floors ended up being out of ice and we had to visit 4 floors before finally getting some.  No big deal though these things happen.  \\n\\nAfter going out for the night and when we got back to the hotel room the key wasn't working. Which also happened two other times for both rooms... not sure why, it wasn't next to cellphones or credit cards. In fact, one had only been sitting on the dresser and still ended up not working.  Not being able to get into your room when all you want to do is sleep is sure to get you grumpy.  We get back to the room and find out that the sink still hadn't been fixed and when I turned on the shower the shower head was pointed out and sprayed all over the floor. Simple things to keep guest happy that can be changed.\\n\\nWe went down to the pool and it's a pretty nice atmosphere. The lazy river is all we wanted to do and it's $10 to rent an inner tube or $10 to buy a small or $15 to buy a large. I just bought one incase we were going to come back later.  Although, I'm not sure what I'm going to do with it now... There was lots of families and older couples, not really the place you're going to meet a sexy guy or chick. Overall it was nice and relaxing.\\n\\nWe didn't gamble at all, though the casino wasn't very happening.  The food court is quick and there is a good variety.

Who doesn't like the sound of that?\\n\\nI certainly don't, so that's why I made a beeline to Julian Serrano for my first night's dinner on the Strip.\\n\\nFirst of all, Chef Julian Serrano's eponymous restaurant is absolutely beautiful.  It overflows with bold, colorful tile that's a feast for the eyes.  It's also *very* loud in there, since it's directly adjacent to the Aria resort lobby, a mere feet from hordes of tired hotel guests checking in and out.  And, no, there are no walls to keep out the hubbub.\\n\\nAfter taking a seat at the long, comfortably, and classy bar, I was quickly helped by one of the friendly and efficiently bartenders.  After ordering a glass of Sauvignon blanc to whet the palate, I browsed the mouthwatering -- and **long** -- menu of tapas options.  The menu is nicely organized into fish/ceviche, veggie, and meat/poultry tapas, making it easy to navigate.  There's also a catch-all \\\"new style\\\" tapas category, as well as paellas and \\\"platos grandes\\\" for those of you with larger appetites.\\n\\nFour items were just enough to fill the belly without making me uncomfortably full.  Here's the rundown of what I tried:\\n\\n1.  White ceviche.  Everyone knows I love a good ceviche, and this one was a knockout.  The white fish was tender and flaky, with just the right amount of heat and tang from the lime and cilantro.\\n\\n2.  Brava potatoes.  This dish was a little less exciting than I thought it would be -- it's essentially just fries with aioli.  That said, the flavors were excellent.  There's a *lot* of aioli provided, so I ended up taking the excess off to prevent the potatoes from getting soft.  I did enjoy eating the potatoes with the little skewers provided.\\n\\n3.  Tuna cones.  This dish was the weirdest and also my least favorite.  It consisted of 3 wantons (rolled into ice cream cones), which were filled with avocado, and then ahi tartare and aioli on top.  Again, my issue was the overabundance of aioli, which overwhelmed everything else.  I couldn't taste the tuna at all.\\n\\n4.  Santiago's cake.  This was an almond cake dusted with powdered sugar, with a side of almond ice cream.  Simple but very well done.  My only gripe was that the cake was a little dry, but this was remedied by letting the ice cream melt all over it.  \\n\\nAll in all, Julian Serrano was a great dinner, although the little hiccups along the way make me hesitant about rushing back.  After all, you're paying Vegas Strip prices here (most tapas are in the $10-15 range, but some are more), so you tend to expect perfection for your buck.\\n\\nThat said, with all the amazing options on Julian Serrano's menu, it'd be hard to resist the temptation to try them all.  =)", "output": "4 stars", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 418.json"}, {"instruction": "You are given a review about a place.

I just like meat and veggies, and don't eat the noodles or rice. it was fine with them. My husband and I share the same plate of thinly sliced meat and then get another together so I guess we conserve food that way, but we got four full plates of meat.  The service is very generous and they constantly ask (not in a pesky way)  if you are ready for another round or just taking a break. \\n\\nThe only unfortunate thing for me, is that my husband and I do shabu-shabu at home often and use all sorts of Asian condiments they don't have, like sesame oil, rice vinegar, etc, but still it is no biggie.  We also like to eat the beefy broth that has developed from swish-swishing the meat, they sometimes look at you a bit funny and then give you a very small bowl and very big spoon that is not very soup friendly.\\n\\nI am hugely impressed by how clean this place is.  I saw the one waiter even giving a thorough clean to each burner after it was used.     If you are a soup lover or sukiyaki lover, you must try Swish.  Oh and they even added an AYCE sushi roll option to their menu; the rolls looked decent, but I never ever had one here.

It was clean, it was cozy and it was private; at least that's what I thought until morning time when I found out that the walls were very thin and I could hear practically every word from our neighbors.  Even worse on my last night there, a new set of neighbors were arguing their lungs out at 7:00am waking me up bright and early and losing an hour of extra sleep.  This has to be the first Vegas hotel that I've stayed at where the walls are built this way.  I'd expect that at some run down hotel but not in Vegas.  Another small complaint I have is that the water in the shower takes at least 3 minutes to start getting warm.  This could have just been my room but was rather annoying.  It would have been worse if it never turned warm at all and would have had to take a cold shower.  Here's a quick run-down:\\n\\nPros:\\n-Clean room\\n-Has nice extras like coffee-maker and an actual refrigerator which is a bit rare\\n-Easy access and parking (which is probably why most people highly rate it)\\n\\nCons:\\n-Thin walls which means no privacy and more conversation than talk radio\\n-Water in shower takes a little while to get warm but I guess that's more of an annoyance than anything\\n\\nBottom Line: I can't stay here again.

The two jars I got to taste (mine and my wife's) were both far, far behind Distillerie' in terms of quality and taste. All of the choices seemed very much on the sweet side, which is not too much my thing, do I decided to play it safe and order a Mojito. First big disappointment. Mojitos are always a hit with me, except this wasn't a mojito at all: they served me rum and lemonade with a twig of mint stuck in it at the end just for the look (the mint needs to be crushed first otherwise it won't give any flavour at all).\\n\\nWhen the waiter came to ask about the drinks I thought I'd mention it in case it was a mistake. Second big disappointment. I barely had the chance to start talking that he was already running away. I was able to stop him and explain, and his answer was that they couldn't crush the mint because of all the ice in the jar. 8-/\\n\\nFood was the third big disappointment. I got the Mad Greek, because I felt like something fresh and had great Greek themed burgers in the past. This wasn't one of them. First I find burgers are to thick, so good luck eating it with your hands without making a mess. It didn't help that the Greek toppings were too juicy and completely falling off the burger. Now that would be fine with me, except that the burger was also tasteless. I had a poutine on the side, and was also turned off by the sauce.\\n\\nNow in this whole time we saw our waiter 3 times in total, including taking the drinks then food orders. He hadn't brought any water until we were half way through the meal, didn't ask about the food, and took over twenty minutes to notice we were done with our plates. Mind you in the meantime the restaurant was getting more and more empty. I even had to chase him to get the bill.\\n\\nNow at this point I was fairly disappointed with the experience, and might have given it a 2 or 3 stars. But then came the killer. I decided to leave a 7% tip, which I thought was generous considering the 2.5 minutes the waiter spent at our table, the rushed attitude and the few words. First thing he does one I pay is look at how tip I left, right in front of me. HUGE mistake in my book, something I NEVER did in my years of working as a waiter. But I play along. He asks if I know tip isn't included (duh, I just left you 7%). I say yes, then following his confused look I ask him if he's wondering why is only 7%, which he was of course. When I tell him I was disappointed with both the food and service, his answer was \\\"Well don't come back, okay?\\\" with the kind of superior attitude any respectable waiter I know would never dream of having.\\n\\nWell guess what, I was definitely not planning on going back, now I regret leaving any tip at all.", "output": "1 star", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 418.json"}, {"instruction": "You are given a review about a place.

We drove from LA after work on Friday so we got to Vegas around 12am-1am. When we got there, we tried to book into our room (2 Queens, non smoking) but then the front desk advised us that our room has been double booked and that the only room available is a 1 bd smoking. For everyone that doesn't smoke, a smoking room is a really bad option for it just reeks of cigarettes! We asked for any other room which of course they said \\\"We are TOTALLY booked for the weekend\\\" reply. We asked for anything else that we can get comp'ed on since we were given this unfortunate ordeal, which the front desk replied \\\"Nope\\\". After trying for about 15 minutes, we reluctantly took the keys and just slept in our stinky room.\\n\\nSomehow it gets worse here. We started gambling in TI and I guess lady luck was with us because my friend was on FIRE. He was literally winning hundreds then thousands. After a few hours of hot streak, the pit bosses of the hotel started following us and started to whisper stuff into the dealers ears during our table games. Maybe we were just being paranoid but this made us feel REALLY uneasy. And whenever we cashed out on our winnings, it would take 10-15 minutes. Yes, I know when you win big, they have to verify where we won, etc. (this isn't our first time) but this was taking longer than usual. One thing that made us feel REALLY skeptical was when my friend was betting on my other friend's hand during blackjack. We were all having fun playing this way until the 10th/11th time, my friend tried to bet, the pitboss actually came and said that we can't do that anymore. We argued that we HAVE been playing like that the past 2 days and why all of a sudden, no? Well like some weird coincidence, the hand that the pit boss intervened on was a blackjack. Luck? Maybe but it was just a weird vibe after that. \\n\\nMost likely we'll get comp'ed for TI because of my friend's earnings but even with the free comp, we doubt we'll stay at TI with this bad experience. For a Vegas hotel that's been around as long as TI, you would think they would expect people to have luck once in a while and they would treat their customers with the usual Vegas service.", "output": "1 star", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 418.json"}, {"instruction": "You are given a review about a place.
