Usually, achieving  what you set out to do is not the important thing. Let me explain. Two brothers decided to dig a deep hole behind their house. As they were working, a couple of older boys stopped by to watch. \"What are you doing?\" asked one of the visitors. \"We plan to dig a hole all the way through the earth!\" one of the brothers answered excitedly. The older boys began to laugh, telling the younger ones that digging a hole all the way through the earth was impossible. After a long silence, one of the diggers picked up a jar full of spiders , worms and a lot of insects. He removed the lid  and showed the wonderful contents to the visitors who were laughing at them. Then he said quietly and confidently, \"Even if we don't dig all the way through the earth, look what we found along the way!\" Their goal was far too difficult, but it made them dig. And that is what a goal is for--to make us move in the direction we have chosen. In other words, it sets us to digging! But not every goal will be fully achieved. Not every job will end successfully. Not every hope will come to pass. Not every love will last. But when you fall short of your aim, perhaps you can say, \"Yes, but look at what I found along the way! Look at the wonderful things which have come into my life because I tried to do something!\" And I believe it is the joy in the journey, in the end, that truly matters. \n Question: The writer told us the story to   _   . \n Options: (A) advise us to treats  our failures fairly (B) persuade us to make an aim for our lives (C) encourage us to learn from the two brothers (D) prove that failure helps us make achievements \n Asnwer: A", "output": "Yes", "category": "Question Answering 938.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank, four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\") and the answer to that question.

Although some extra time during the school year is required, once the site is up it needs just minor adjustments each new year. Have a question? Get an answer from online technology support now. Decide which type of software you will use to create a class website. Microsoft has many applications that can be used to create websites, such as Publisher, Word and Expression Web. Some web hosting sites also have simple editing tools you can use instead of a formal program. Find a place to host your class website. Your Internet provider often provides about some small space for a personal website for free, and many other free website hosting companies are on the Internet. Consider using a template for your first attempt at website design. Most templates also come with a selection of color and graphics already in place so you can concentrate on content instead of design. It will contain basic sections with your specific class information. Add content to your website. You need to have announcement sections for both parents and students, a syllabus or class rules area, homework assignments or a calendar, and maybe a links section for learning more about in-class topics and playing educational games. Decorate your website with graphics, clip art, background, cool fonts and other decorative items. It's best to find a theme you like, such as ducks or fire hydrants, and make your design elements all stick with your theme. If you think that is too attractive, go for an abstract look. Remember to keep it simple since too much color and graphics make a site look busy and detract from its usability. \n Question: According to the article, a class website is of great help in   _  . \n Options: (A) playing computer games (B) storing class documents (C) communicating between students and teachers (D) reducing the teachers' time to run the website \n Asnwer: B", "output": "No", "category": "Question Answering 938.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank, four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\") and the answer to that question.

Soon I was able to pronounce the four words clearly, and said them whenever an American tried to talk to me. This answer was very effective at ending our conversation and saving me from another uncomfortable situation, or I would have to communicate in a language that I was not familiar with. Before coming to the States, I thought I knew English pretty well. But the truth is that the grammar and vocabulary-based English that is taught in schools overseas is not the English people speak in America. But fear not! Once you are in America, you can immediately begin to bridge the gap between the learned English that you already know, and the spoken English that is all around you. To do this, first of all, it is important not to fear when you realize that you may not be as prepared for daily communication as you thought. For me, as soon as I stopped worrying about my accent and started speaking, I made rapid progress. Often the people didn't notice my mistakes because they were so glad to finally be able to communicate with me. Another good idea is to listen carefully and pay attention to the way in which ideas are expressed. For example, if you are working hard and you want to stop working and rest for a little while, you can either say \"I would like to stop working and rest for a while\" or \"I want to take a quick break from work.\" The first sentence, I quickly learned, sounds dry and too formal for any kind of communication, while the second is an idiom that is widely used in American English conversation. Finally, use what you already know---the vocabulary, the grammar and the spelling. Try to use these into the spoken language for more impressive and accurate speaking results. \n Question: At first the writer preferred to use the sentence \"I don't speak English\" to  _ \n Options: (A) admit he is a foreigner (B) save much time for himself (C) prevent himself from being laughed at (D) avoid getting upset in communicating with others \n Asnwer: D", "output": "Yes", "category": "Question Answering 938.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank, four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\") and the answer to that question.

But the words, Carl Walter spoke that day, came back to me years later, and ever since have been of great value to me. Carl Walter was my piano teacher. During one of my lessons he asked how much practicing I was doing. I said three or four hours a day. \"Do you practice , an hour at a time?\" \"I try to.\" \"Well, don't,\" he exclaimed. \"When you grow up, time won't come in long stretches.    Practice in minutes, whenever you can find them five or ten before school, after lunch, between household tasks. Spread the practice through the day, and piano-playing will become a part of your life.\" When I was teaching at Columbia, I wanted to write, but class periods, theme-reading, and committee meetings filled my days and evenings. For two years I got practically nothing down on paper, and my excuse was that I had no time. Then I remembered what Carl Walter had said. During the next week I conducted an experiment. Whenever I had five minutes unoccupied, I sat down and wrote a hundred words or so. To my astonishment, at the end of the week I had a rather large manuscript ready for revision, later on I wrote novels by the same piecemeal method. Though my teaching schedule had become heavier than ever, in every day there were idle moments which could be caught and put to use. I even took up piano--playing again, finding that the small intervals of the day provided sufficient time for both writing and piano practice. There is an important trick in this time--using formula: you must get into your work quickly. If you have but five minutes for writing, you can't afford to waste four chewing your pencil. You must make your mental preparations beforehand, and concentrate on your task almost instantly when the time comes. Fortunately, rapid concentration is easier than most of us realize. I admit I have never learnt how to let go easily at the end of the five or ten minutes. But life can be counted on to supply interruptions. Carl Walter has had a tremendous influence on my life. To him I owe the discovery that even very short periods of time add up to all useful hours I need, if I plunge in without delay. \n Question: Which of the following statements is true? \n Options: (A) The writer didn't completely take the teacher's words to heart at first. (B) Carl Walter has had a great influence on the writer's life since he became a student. (C) The writer owes great thanks to his teacher for teaching him to work in long stretches.

Now, however, doctors have begun to look into laughter and the effects it has on the human body. They have found that laughter really can improve people's health. Tests were carried out to study the effects of laughter on the body. People watched funny films while doctors checked their heart, blood pressure, breathing and muscles. It was found that laughter has similar effects to physical exercises. It increases blood pressure, the heart beating and breathing. It also works several groups of muscles in the face, the stomach, and even the feet. If laughter exercises the body, it must be beneficial. Other tests have shown that laughter appears to be able to reduce the effect of pain on the body. In one experiment doctors produced pain in groups of students who listened to different radio programs. The group that tolerated  the pain for the longest time was the groups which listened to a funny program. The reason why laughter can reduce pain seems to be that it helps to produce a kind of chemicals in the brain which _ both stress and pain. As a result of these discoveries, some doctors in the United States now hold laughter clinics, in which they help to improve their patients' condition by encouraging them to laugh. They have found that even if their patients do not really feel like laughing, making them smile is enough to produce beneficial effects similar to those who are caused by laughter. \n Question: The main idea of the passage is   _  . \n Options: (A) laughter and physical exercises have similar effects.

Marie Curie was a Polish physicist and chemist. Together with her husband, Pierre, she discovered two new elements and studied the x-rays they emitted. She found that the harmful properties of x-rays were able to kill tumors. By the end of World War I, Marie Curie was probably the most famous woman in the world. She had made a conscious decision, however, not to patent methods of processing radium or its medical applications. Marie Curie was born on November 7, 1867 in Poland and died on July 4, 1934. Her co-discovery with her husband Pierre Curie of the radioactive elements radium and polonium represents one of the best known stories in modern science for which they were recognized in 1901 with the Nobel Prize for Physics. In 1911, Marie Curie was honored with a second Nobel prize, this time for chemistry, to honor her for successfully isolating pure radium and determining radium's atomic weight. As a child, Marie Curie amazed people with her great memory. She learned to read when she was only four years old. Her father was a professor of science and the instruments that he kept in a glass case fascinated Marie. She dreamed of becoming a scientist, but that would not be easy. Her family became very poor, and at the age of 18, Marie became a governess. She helped pay for her sister to study in Paris. Later, her sister helped Marie with her education. In 1891, Marie attended the Sorbonne University in Paris where she met and married Pierre Curie, a well-known physicist. Marie Curie contributed greatly to our understanding of radioactivity and the effects of x-rays. She received two Nobel prizes for her brilliant work, but died of leukemia, caused by her repeated exposure to radioactive material. \n Question: When did Marie Curie win a Nobel Prize for a chemistry? \n Options: (A) In her twenties (B) In her thirties (C) In her forties (D) In her fifties \n Asnwer: A", "output": "No", "category": "Question Answering 938.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank, four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\") and the answer to that question.

Lucky that some things went my way: my eyesight, for example, was good enough to allow me to become a fighter pilot. And lucky that when I left the army, I found work as an airline pilot, when such jobs weren't plentiful. I still feel lucky, after all these years, to be able to follow my passion. The airline industry has its problems, and a lot of them can be troubling, but I still find purpose and satisfaction in flying. There's some freedom you feel when you're flying above the surface of the earth, no longer limited by gravity. Even at a thousand feet, you get a wider perspective. Problems that seem large down below feel smaller from that height, and smaller still by the time you reach thirty-five thousand feet. I love that flying is an intellectual challenge. If you change the angle of the nose by even one degree while traveling at a typical commercial airliner speed of seven miles a minute, it's enough to increase or decrease your rate of climb or descent by seven hundred feet per minute. I enjoy keeping track of all the calculations, staying aware of the weather conditions, working with a team while knowing closely what the plane can and cannot do. I like the challenge of that. I also like sharing my passion for flying. It's a disappointment to me that a lot of kids today aren't fascinated by flight. I've watched countless children walk past the plane without paying much attention; they're too focused on their video games or their iPods. When there are children who eagerly want a look inside \"my office\" at the front of the plane, it's so rewarding to see their excitement about something I care deeply about. If we aren't busy during boarding, the first officer and I enjoy inviting curious children to sit in our seats in the cockpit , ask questions, and let their parents take photos of them wearing a captain's hat. Being a pilot has a tangible end result that is beneficial to society. It feels good to take a planeload of 183 people where they need or want to go. My job is to reunite people with family and friends, to send them on vacations, to bring them to loved ones' funerals, to get them to their job interviews. By the end of a day, I feel as if I've accomplished something. All of them have their own stories, motivations, needs -- and helping them brings a rewarding feeling. This is what gets me ready for work, and one of the things I look forward to. \n Question: What makes the author feel lucky is that   _  . \n Options: (A) he was able to find a job as a pilot (B) his job is satisfying and totally free of trouble (C) he began flying even when he was very young (D) his physical condition enables him to be a spaceman \n Asnwer: A", "output": "Yes", "category": "Question Answering 938.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank, four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\") and the answer to that question.

Regardless of all the talking around, she went on with her story. Her husband had been a doctor before he retired. One day when he was on duty at the hospital, he felt a sharp pain at the heart. By his professional knowledge he knew immediately he suffered a fit of heart attack. His colleagues carried him at once to the operation room and prepared  him for a bypass operation, which was highly risky. The patient's family members had to be informed before it began. The patient himself was allowed to put in a word. Lying silently on the operation table with a trembling hand, he dialed after a moment's thinking of the number of his wife's phone. Finally a familiar voice came from the other end... \"So many years had passed but memory of this incident remained fresh in my mind. What he said in the beginning was: 'Are you standing or sitting?'

The Emergency Services, the Fire Departments, the Police, hospitals, and ambulances stood by, ready to go into action. In railway underground stations, people read notices and maps that told them where to go and what to do in the emergency. This was Exercise Flood Call, to prepare people for a flood emergency. London wasn't flooded. In 1928, people living in Westminster, the heart of London, drowned in floods. And in 1953, one hundred people, living on the eastern edge of the London suburbs were killed, again, in the floods. At last, Greater London Council took actions to prevent this disaster from happening again.  Though a flood wall was built in the 1960s, Londoners still must be prepared for the possible disaster. If it happens, 50 underground stations will be under water. Electricity, gas and phone services will be out of action. Roads will be drowned. It will be impossible to cross any of the bridges between north and south London. Imagine: London will look like the famous Italian city, Venice.

If movies were completely scientifically accurate, they'd probably be as interesting as a Physics 101 lecture. In real life, there are no explosions in space, gas usually doesn't explode from a lit cigarette, and Bruce Willis / Jackie Chan / Will Smith would most likely be in a coma  after getting kicked in the head. Recently, the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph ran a humorous piece on unconvincing tech moments from some top movies. Let's see what _ are all about. Telegraph writer Tom Chivers' first example is from the end-of-the-world movie Independence Day, in which a character comes up with a virus capable of destroying Windows, the computer system the alien  spacecraft uses. \"It's a good thing they didn't have Norton antivirus,\" jokes Chivers. It's just one case of a movie that takes a lot of license with its science. Another one Chivers mentions is from Star Wars, where glowing beams of light traveling through space look very impressive. The problem is that in space there are no air particles  for the light to reflect off. In reality, they'd not be seen, which wouldn't look so cool on the big screen. Chivers' second piece of Star Wars nonsense is the sound the fighters make in the movies: \" the bellow  of an elephant mixed with a car driving on a wet road\". But sound needs a medium to travel through, like air. In space, there wouldn't actually be any sound at all. Few people would deny that the mind-bending Matrix films make for great viewing, but for Chivers, the science in the movies is a little silly. And finally: as Chivers points out, DAN is not replaceable. But this bit of elementary genetics passed the makers of the 2002 Bond film Die another Day by. In the film the villain  has \"gene therapy\" to change his appearance and his DNA, which is completely impossible. \n Question: What does the text mainly deal with? \n Options: (A) Plots of some famous movies.

And she used every opportunity during her visit to repeat this message. But, back in London, her views were not shared by some members of the British government, which refused to support a ban on these weapons. Angry politicians launched an attack on the Princess in the press. They described her as \"very ill-informed\" and a \"loose cannon\" . The Princess responded by brushing aside the criticisms: \"This is a distraction , we do not need. All I'm trying to do is help.\" Opposition parties, the media and the public immediately voiced their support for the Princess. To make matters worse for the government, it soon emerged that the Princess's trip had been approved by the Foreign Office, and that she was in fact very well-informed about both the situation in Angola and the British government's policy regarding landmines. The result was a severe embarrassment for the government. To try and limit the damage, the Foreign Secretary, Malcolm Rifkidnd, claimed that the Princess's views on landmines were not very different from government policy, and that it was \"working towards\" a worldwide ban. The Defense Secretary, Michael Portillo, claimed the matter was \"a misinterpretation or misunderstanding.\" For the Princess, the trip to this war-torn country was an excellent opportunity to use her popularity to show the world how much destruction and suffering landmines can cause. She said that the experience had also given her the chance to get closer to people an their problems. \n Question: Princess Diana paid a visit to Angola in 1997 \n Options: (A) to clarify the British government's stand on landmines (B) to establish her image as a friend of landmine victims (C) to investigate the sufferings of landmine victims there (D) to voice her support for a total ban of landmines \n Asnwer: D", "output": "Yes", "category": "Question Answering 938.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank, four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\") and the answer to that question.

The latest research makes it known that the reason could be that men's hearts go into rapid decline  when they reach middle age.

Between the age of 20 and 70, one-third of those cells die and are not replaced in men,\" said Goldspink. \"This is part of the ageing process.\" What surprises scientists is that the female heart sees very little loss of these cells. A healthy 70-year-old woman's heart could perform almost as well as a 20-year-old one's. \"This gender( ) difference might just explain why women live longer than men,\" said Goldspink. They studied more than 250 healthy men and women between the ages of 18 and 80, focusing on healthy persons to remove the confusing influence of disease. \"The team has yet to find why ageing takes a greater loss on the male heart,\" said Goldspink.

His victim, who picked up the ticket, then claimed the PS25000 prize, managed to trace him, and handed over the cash. The robbery happened when maths professor Vinicio Sabbatucci,58, was changing a tyre on an Italian motorway. Another motorist, who stopped  \"to help\", stole a suitcase from his car and drove off. The professor found the dropped ticket and put it in his pocket before driving home to Ascoli in eastern Italy.     Next day, he saw the lottery results on TV and, taking out the ticket, realized it was a winner. He claimed the 60 million lire  prize. Then he began a battle with his conscience. Finally, he decided he could not keep the money despite having been robbed. He advertised in newspapers and on radio, saying: \"I'm trying to find the man who robbed me. I have 60 million for him--- a lottery win. Please meet me. Anonymity  guaranteed.\"     Professor Sabbatucci received hundreds of calls from people hoping to trick him into handing them the cash. But there was one voice he recognized--- and he arranged to meet the man in a park. The robber, a 35-year-old unemployed father of two, gave back the suitcase and burst into tears. He could not believe what was happening. \"Why didn't you keep the money?\" he asked.

You spend an hour with them and feel as if you've known them half your life. These people have something in common. And once you know what it is, we can try to do it ourselves. How is it done? Here are several skills that good talkers have. If you follow the skills, they will help you to put people at their ease, and make friends with them quickly. First of all, good talkers have asked questions. Almost anyone, no matter how shy he is, will answer a question. One well-known businesswoman says, \"At business lunches, I always ask people what they did that morning. It's a common question, but it will get things going.\" From there you can move on to other matters ----sometimes to really personal questions. And how he answers will let you know how far you can go. Second, once good talkers have asked questions, they listen for the answers. This point seems clear, but it isn't. Your question should have a point and help to tell what sort of person you are talking to. And to find out, you really have to listen carefully and attentively. Real listening at least means some things. First it means not to change the subject of conversation. If someone sticks to one topic, you can take it as a fact that he is really interested in it. Real listening also means not just listening to words, but to the tone  of voice. If the voice sounds dull, then it's time for you to change the subject. Finally, good talkers know well how to deal with the occasion of parting. If you're saying goodbye, you may give him a firm shakehand and say, \"I've really enjoyed meeting you.\" If you want to see that person again, don't keep it a secret. Let people know what you feel, and they may walk away feeling as if they've known you half their lives. \n Question: You'll like to stay with some people  _  . \n Options: (A) who have something in common with you (B) when you get into real trouble (C) with whom you feel it easy to get along well (D) from whom you can get necessary and timely help \n Asnwer: C", "output": "Yes", "category": "Question Answering 938.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank, four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\") and the answer to that question.

His worried wife Nicola only found out he was being held after she reported him missing when he did not turn up for their daughter's ninth birthday party. The 54-year-old man had his fingerprints, DNA and _ taken before being questioned about why he did not appear to be enjoying the event on July 28. Police said Mr. Worsfold, who was held for over five hours, was arrested because of his manner, his state of dress and his being too near to the course. A spokesman added that the arrest was necessary to avoid a breach   of the peace because he was standing near a group of protesters  . But Mr. Worsfold, who was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2010, said that one of the symptoms of the disease is muscle rigidity, which can cause his face to become expressionless. \"I was sitting minding my own business\", he told a local newspaper. \"Before I knew anything the police grabbed me off this seven-foot wall, threw me to the floor and handcuffed me, so all I saw of the cycle race was between the feet of people from the pavement.

There's a campsite picnic shelter a few minutes down the path. And then you remember that your car is parked down the road. What's your safest choice to make sure you and your families are safe? It's a common question for many hikers and campers, especially when they are camping during summer months. Heading to your car is almost always the safest choice. Your tent and a picnic shelter will keep you dry, but they offer little or no protection against lightening. Your car, on the other hand, will keep you dry and protect you from lightening strikes. Protecting yourself against possible lightening strikes is very important; lightening kills an average of 62 people in the US each year.

Especially now we've got drugs for getting rid of sad feelings -- whether it's after losing a job, the break-up of a relationship or the death of a loved one. So it's no surprise that more and more people are taking them. But is  _ really such a good idea? A growing number of voices from the world of mental health research are saying it isn't. They fear that the increasing tendency to treat normal sadness as a disease is playing fast and loose  . Sadness, they argue, serves a useful purpose--and if we lose it, we lose out. Yet many psychiatrists   insist not. Sadness has a nasty habit of turning into depression , they warn. Even when people are sad for good reason, they should take drugs to make themselves feel better. So who is right? Is sadness something we cannot live without or something horrible never to touch?  There are lots of ideas about why feeling sad should become part of human life. It may be a self-protection strategy, as other primates   also show signs of sadness. A losing monkey that doesn't show sadness after it loses a fight may be seen as continuing to challenge the winning monkey -- and that could result in death. In humans sadness has a further function: we may display sadness as a form of communication. By acting sad, we tell other community members that we need support. Then there is the idea that creativity is connected to dark moods. There are plenty of great artists, writers and musicians who have suffered from depression or disorder. Scientists found that people with signs of depression performed better at a creative task, and negative moods make people think deeply over the unhappy experience, which allows creative processes to come to the front. There is also evidence that too much happiness can be bad for your career. A doctor found that people who scored 8 out of 10 on a happiness test were more successful in income and education than 9s or 10s. The happiest people lose their willingness to make changes to their lives that may benefit them. \n Question: The author believes sadness is   _  . \n Options: (A) a good thing for people's health (B) something horrible never to touch (C) a necessary function of humans' (D) always to be treated as depression \n Asnwer: C", "output": "Yes", "category": "Question Answering 938.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank, four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\") and the answer to that question.

Do you realize that you have made a statement? Hold the glance for a second longer and you have made a different situation, there is a permissible time that you can hold a person's stare without being friendly, rude, or aggressive. If you are on a lift, what stare-time are you permitted? To answer this question, consider what you typically do. You very likely give other passengers a quick glance to size them up and to assure them that you mean no harm. Since being close to another person signals the possibility of interaction, you need to send out a signal telling others you want to be left alone. So you cut off eye contact----what sociologist Erving Goffiman calls \"a dimming  of the lights\". You look down at the floor, at the indicator  lights, anywhere but into another passenger's eyes. Should you break the rule against staring at a stranger on a lift, you will make the other person extremely uncomfortable, and you are likely to feel a bit strange yourself. If you hold eye contact for more than 3 seconds, what are you telling another person? Much depends on the person and the situation. For instance, a man and a woman communicate interest in this manner. They stare at each other for about 3 seconds at a time, and then drop their eyes down for 3 seconds, before letting their eyes meet again.

While it is generally taken as an indicator of their marital   status, the practice is primarily related to the Hindu religion.

However, the tradition of men wearing it has faded in recent times, so nowadays we see a lot more women than men wearing one. The position of the bindi is standard: center of the forehead, close to the eyebrows. It represents a third, or inner eye. Hindu tradition holds that all people have three eyes: The two outer ones are used for seeing the outside world, and the third one is there to focus inward toward God. As such, the dot serves as a constant reminder to keep God in the front of a believer's thoughts. Red is the traditional color of the dot. It is said that in ancient times a man would place a drop of blood between his wife's eyes to seal their marriage. According to Hindu beliefs, the color red is believed to bring good fortune to the married couple. Today, people go with different colors depending upon their preferences. Women often wear dots that match the color of their clothes.

I'll leave that question to others. Regardless of how you feel about the event, one conclusion is obvious. Using the theme of \"A Day Without\" as a way to focus national attention on a particular subject is a great idea, and could serve as a method for increasing public consciousness about other issues that affect daily life in America. Here are my top three examples: \"A Day Without Speeding.\" How hard could this be? If all drivers would strictly obey every posted speed limit on highways, downtown, on neighborhood streets, and in parking lots for one 24-hour cycle, the benefits would be huge. \"A Day Without Losing Your Temper.\" A higher degree of difficulty here, and I know that from personal experience. When something goes wrong at home or on the job, there may be brief satisfaction in yelling or kicking the furniture, but bursting into anger usually has nothing to do with the approach to the heart of the matter. \"A Day Without Having All The Answers.\" I would like to get a break from hearing anyone speak the phrase, \"Here's what you're doing wrong.\" Right now the US is packed with citizens who believe they can point out the cause of every single problem in existence and then solve it in a moment. I believe they need to be quiet sometimes and use their ears instead of their voices. I wonder how would average Americans react to such a national pause? Would it be a day of reaction against anger, or joyful celebrations? \n Question: The author uses his \"top three examples\" to  _  . \n Options: (A) criticize the undocumented illegal immigrants in America (B) show public consciousness of some subjects could be raised (C) encourage common people to create more similar activities (D) indicate some bothering issues affecting people's daily life \n Asnwer: D", "output": "No", "category": "Question Answering 938.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank, four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\") and the answer to that question.

They might go on blind dates set up by family and friends. They might write personal ad to place in newspapers. Or they might use a computer to help them in their search for a soul mate by joining an online dating service. Some people have even tried to find their perfect match through game shows on television. Many of these TV dating shows, including The Bachelor andWho Wants to Marry Multimillionaire?, have proved to be popular, with millions of viewers watching each week to find out which of the contestants  will find true love. Of all these game shows, perhaps the one with the most unexpected ending was Mr. Right, which was shown in England in 2002. On the show, a bachelor, thirty-five-year-old Lance Gerrard-Wright, dated fifteen women to find the one who was his ideal partner. The host of the show was Ulrika Jonsson, an English celebrity   originally from Sweden. For seven weeks on the show, Lance took turns going on dates with each of the women, taking them to expensive restaurants and romantic locations. He even met the women's families and introduced them to his own. Then at the end of each episode , he would choose between one and three of the contestants with whom he had felt the least compatible , and say goodbye to them. At one point during the series, one contestant volunteered to leave because she said she didn't find him attractive. After two dates she said she had had enough, and she couldn't see it working, \"He wasn't my cup of tea.\" In another episode the woman he was on a date with burst into tears when he called her by another girl's name. \"You called me by another girl's name. I can't believe you did that. I really liked you,\" she said in tears. But in the final episode, the woman he eventually chose decided she didn't want to marry him after all. \"I think you've chosen me because you have to choose someone,\" she said. Maybe this was because she already knew he had fallen in love with the show's host! After leaving the show, Gerrard-Wright and Jonsson were seen dining together and attending parties around London more and more often. Finally, on May 1, 2003, Gerrard-Wright proposed to Jonsson on the steps of St. Paul's Cathedral. And she accepted his proposal right away, although she had to make sure that her two children from previous relationships--an eight-year-old son, Cameron, and a two-year-old daughter, Bo. agreed to the marriage. Luckily, they did. Gerrard-Wright said, \"In the end the show did work for me. I grabbed an opportunity to get a girlfriend and I did. Ulrika's amazing\" The happy couple finally got married at Jonsson's home in Sweden on the island of Varmdo. They wanted to keep the ceremony small, so only forty people were invited, including family and friends. There was some gossip at the time that Jonsson's friends who did not receive invitations to the wedding felt upset. But the bride and groom did not let that ruin their wedding day. Has Ulrika Jonsson finally found Mr. Right? Only time will tell. But none of the guests at the wedding could deny the happiness in the couple's eyes as the bride and groom left the wedding ceremony with the music of Stevie Wonder playing in the background, \"Seen a lot of things in this old world.

Wherever you go in this country you will see both children and grown-ups knocking a ball about with a stick or something, as if in Britain men shall always remain boys and women girls! Still, it can never be bad to get exercise, can it? Taking all amateur and professional sports in Britain into consideration, there can be no doubt that football is at the top of the list. It is called soccer in the United States. The game originated in Britain and was played in the Middle Ages or even earlier, though as an organized game, or \"association football\", it dates only from the beginning of the 19th century. The next is rugby, which is called \"football\" in the United States. It is a kind of football played by two teams of fifteen players rather than eleven. The rugby, in which an oval-shaped ball is used can be handled as well as kicked. It is a pretty rough game. In summer, cricket is the most popular sport. In fact, it has sometimes been called the English national game. Most foreigners find the game rather slow or even boring, but it enjoys great popularity among the British. Tennis rates high on the list, too. It was introduced into England from France in the 15th century, but it was from England that it spread to practically every country in the world. Table-tennis or \"ping-pong\" surely is not played on a great scale as it is in China or in Japan. Basketball and volleyball were introduced into Britain during the late 19th century from America and are gaining popularity.

In many areas, this light makes it difficult or impossible to observe stars and planets in the night sky. There are a number of reasons why light pollution is important. One has become clear at the Mount Wilson Observatory near Los Angeles, California. Today, light from Los Angeles makes the night sky above Mount Wilson very bright. It is no longer an important reasearch center because of light pollution. Light pollution threatens to reduce the scientific value of research telescoples in other important observatories. They include Lick Observatory near San Jose, California and Yerkes Observatory near Chicago, Illionis. Light pollution is the result of wasted energy. Bright light that shines into the sky is not being used to provide light where it is needed on Earth. Poorly designed lighting causes a great deal of light pollution. Lights that are brighter than necessary also cause light pollution. Most people in America are surprised to find out that they are able to see our own galaxy ,the Milky Way, with their own eyes. But about threefourths of Americans cannot see the Miky Way because of manmade light. Objects in the night sky are resources that provide everyone with wonder.

It would be difficult to count the number of such words, messages, letters, and reports put into mails or delivered by hand, but the daily figures must be extremely large.

Work hard to get good grades. Don't sweat about one bad grade, but always strive to do your best. 2. Get involved, and stay involved, in extracurricular activities. Sports, clubs, drama, bands and orchestras-these often count toward a student's overall scholarship application evaluation. The same goes for paid (or unpaid) work experience. 3. Begin your scholarship research early-by your sophomore or junior year of high school, if possible. Make special note of application deadlines, as they can vary from late summer to late spring. 4. Apply for as many scholarships as you are eligible for-several smaller scholarships can add up to a lot of money. *During the application process 1. Read the supplementary materials that come with scholarship application forms to better understand the program's focus (community service, subject interest). Try to answer the questions with the focus area in mind. 2. Answer questions as they are asked. Don't go off the topic. 3. If there is a financial component to the application, make sure you get accurate and complete information from all appropriate sources to ensure your eligibility. 4. Take your time. Write down everything you can think of for each question, then set the application aside for a day so you can look everything over again before you send it off. 5. Don't wait until the last minute to complete your application, especially if you are applying online. Computer systems can get clogged with the large volume of applicants hoping to submit their qualifications during the last few days and hours before a deadline. 6. If a third party has to complete part of your application, such as providing a letter of recommendation, make sure you ask them early on and remind them as often as necessary to ensure they provide you with the necessary materials. 7.

I was a model holidaymaker as a kid.However,the problems started during my twenties.A trip to the south of France was ended after just two days,mainly because I had an urge to check my e-mails.Similarly,my honeymoon was cut short by 48 hours--not because my wife and I weren't enjoying ourselves,but because we were missing our cats.

Thankfully,I'm not alone.This summer,most of my friends have decided not to have a break.And a recent survey proved the _ of holidays,with the results showing that nearly two thirds of people found that the calming effects of a holiday wore off within 24 hours,as stress levels returned to normal.And this year The Idler magazine published its Book of Awful Holidays.Here you will find a list of the five most ecologically-damaging vacations it's possible to take,along with 50 painful holiday experiences voted for on The Idler website.

There has been an endless series of mostly fruitless education reforms to address this gap ( ).    Now comes an approach based on the insights  of a group of US exchange students. They spent a year in some of the most successful high schools in the world -in Finland, Poland and South Korea.    Author and journalist Amanda Ripley followed three exchange students for her new book, The Smartest Kids in the World - and How They Got That Way. She argues that to improve academics, US schools should de-emphasize sports.    Instead, students should bring their passion and intensity  to academics , she concludes.    \"High school in Finland, Korea and Poland had a purpose, just like high school football practice in America,\" she writes. \"There was a big , important contest at the end, and the score counted.\"   Sports are a distraction  ,Ripley argues, and most countries require them to take place outside of school.    Trading in US school sports culture would be a huge change for people in the US , who respect teamwork and sportsmanship as training for life.    But playing down sports could pay off, as it has elsewhere, if we redirect money , focus and glory to learning.    Ripley is critical  of memorization in South Korean education, but she praises the system's high goals and the free-dom its students have to fail and recover through hard work.    Too often , we don't ask teachers to give our kids harder assignments  -and we're quick to complain about a failing grade. What's working elsewhere is to set ambitious  goals for kids ,and then allow them to discover that they have it within themselves to reclaim  success from failure.   Each of the countries in Smartest Kids came to education reform after an economic crisis  . Finland was losing jobs after graduating just 10 percent of its teens from high school in the 1950s. Today , the graduation rate is 95 percent . Poland's wakeup came in 1999, as students consistently tested below average in reading.    We've tried so many \"reforms\" in education. Maybe what we need is a truly radical  shift away from sports in favor of schooling. \n Question: Which of the following statements about education in South Korea is True according to the article? \n Options: (A) High academic scores are considered an important measure of education quality in South Korea. (B) The memorization skills of South Korean students are the keys to their academic success. (C) South Korean teachers emphasize teamwork and sportsmanship as much as American teachers do.

They're also an environmental hazard. Their manure contains phosphorus ,which, when it rains, runs off into lakes and rivers, consuming oxygen, killing fish, stimulating algae overgrowth and emitting greenhouse gases.     Doing away with the pig is not an option. Pigs provide more dietary protein, more cheaply, to more people than any other animal. Northern Europe still maintains the highest pig-to-human ratio in the world (2-1 in Denmark), but East Asia is catching up. During the 1990s, pork production doubled in Vietnam and grew by 70 percent in China--along densely populated coastlines, pig density exceeds 100 animals per square kilometer. The resulting pollution is \"threatening fragile coastal marine habitats including mangroves ,coral reefs and sea grasses ,\"according to a report released in February by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. As it turns out, there is a solution to the pig problem, but it requires a change of mind-set among environmentalists and the public. Two Canadian scientists have created a pig whose manure doesn't contain very much phosphorus at all. If this variety of pig were adopted widely, It could greatly reduce a major source of pollution. But the Enviropig, as they call it, is the product of genetic modification--which is anathema  to many Westerners.     The Enviropig is one of many new technologies that are putting environmentalists and organic-food supporters in _ : should they remain categorically  opposed to genetically modified (GM)foods even at the expense of the environment? Elsewhere, trees grown for paper could be made amenable to much more efficient processing, reducing both energy usage and toxic chemical bleach  in waste water from paper mills. The most significant GM applications will be ones that help lessen the problem of agriculture , which accounts for 38percent of the world's landmass and is crowding out natural ecosystems and species habitats. Chances are, farmers will continue to grow their polluting organic pork, their allergenic organic soy and their neurotoxin  sprayed organic apples. Worse still, they will make sure that no one else gets a choice in the matter of improving the conditions of life on earth--unless, that is, others rise up and demand an alternative. \n Question: Which of the following statements is TRUE? \n Options: (A) Pigs bring more destruction than benefit to human beings.

It's the cooking, eating, talking, playing and family living that go on inside, which are important as well. And at home you usually feel safe and relaxed.

Reaching a beach in Trinidad, she became the first woman on record to swim across the Atlantic Ocean--a dream she'd had since the early 1960s,when a stormy transAtlantic   flight got her thinking she could wear a life vest and swim the rest of the way if needed.

Her journey came a decade after French swimmer Benoit Lecomte made the first known solo transAtlantic swim,covering nearly 4,000 miles from Massachusetts to France in 73 days.No woman on record had made the crossing.

The making of conventional glass bottles and the corks   uses large quantities of natural resources and causes a lot of pollution. Beyond manufacturing, the transport of wine in glass bottles across the country and around the world also has its environmental effect. Trucking all the heavy glass bottles causes a much larger carbon footprint than the transportation of much lighter boxed wine. Almost half the weight of an ordinary case of wine comes from the bottles; about 95 percent of the weight of a case of boxed wine is the wine itself. \"A standard wine bottle holds 750 milliliters of wine and causes about 5.2 pounds of carbon dioxide when it travels from a farm in California to a store in New York,\" reports Colman, a researcher. \"A 3-liter box causes about half the carbon dioxide per 750 milliliters.\" According to the Wine Group, the third largest wine company in the world and a big advocate for switching away from glass bottles, there are other advantages to boxed wine (which typically includes a plastic bag within a cardboard box). The vacuum   packaging of boxed wine allows it to stay fresh for up to six weeks in the fridge once the seal is broken and the first glass has been poured. Still, despite the benefits, boxed wine may still be a tough pill to swallow for many wine experts. \"Even those traditionalists who are coming around to the idea that maybe screw caps   are fine for some wines, would not like the idea of a cellar   full of cardboard boxes,\" says wine writer Lee Asbell. \"It is difficult to imagine how wine service at fine-dining establishments would handle such a change.\" For now, boxed wine is still the field of cheaper brands.

A big question has been: Are they still active? The scientists say yes. Their evidence for recent volcanic activity on Venus comes from a lava  flow in the planet's northern hemisphere. The flow is hotter than the rocks around, which means the lava might still be cooling off. \"The flow we studied seems to be very young---it is still warm inside,\" Nataliya Bondarenko said. Venus is a difficult planet to study from Earth because it is surrounded by thick clouds. Telescopes on Earth can't see through these clouds, so the best information about Venus comes from spacecraft orbiting it. Bondarenko and her colleagues studied the lava flow using data from NASA's Magellan mission. That spacecraft spent four years in orbit around Venus and used radar to make a map of 98 percent of the planet's surface. On October 11th, 1994, the mission ended, and the spacecraft plunged   through Venus' heavy cloud cover and crashed onto the planet below. While in orbit, the Magellan craft sent microwaves, which can go through Venus' clouds, to the surface. Microwaves are invisible and can be as long as three feet. These waves are a kind of energy, like light. And like light, they bounce off surfaces. The way the waves bounced off the Venus' surface and back to the craft supplied information that the scientists used to estimate the temperature of various parts of the planet's surface. Bondarenko's team found that the lava flow was hotter than its surroundings---which may mean the lava flow is in the process of cooling. The scientists say the lava flow can't be very old because if it were, it would have cooled off enough that Magellan wouldn't have noticed the difference in microwaves. She adds that the flow appears in a 1978 view of the surface that a craft called the Pioneer Venus Orbiter captured. \n Question: What happened to Magellan in the end? \n Options: (A) It was floating in space forever.

During our summer months, we have warm days but cool evenings, especially if you are near the ocean. Those cool evenings can feel cold and fresh if you are visiting from someplace that is typically hot and damp all summer. And during our winter months, we can have days that reach 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius). In fact, our winter months are the sunniest months of the year along the San Diego coast. How to get around San Diego Deciding whether you need to rent a car for your visit to San Diego? If you are planning to visit attractions in and around downtown San Diego, including SeaWorld, San Diego Zoo, Balboa Park, Old Town, Coronado, and the Gaslamp Quarter, all of these attractions can be readily accessed by public transportation assuming the hotel or place you are staying in is close to a bus or trolley stop. Tour guests comment on how easy it is to use our transportation system, how clean it is, and the low cost for a one-day or multi-day pass that works on both buses and trolleys. However, if you are going to visit attractions further away from downtown San Diego such as the Safari Park or Legoland or if you want to visit our local mountains or desert, we recommend a car rental. How to make time for all the things to do Our final tip for now is to plan ahead. Unlike most cities where there may be a few concentrated tourist areas and it's easy to find things as you go, San Diego offers hundreds of attractions and guests tell us they are overwhelmed and certainly didn't plan enough time once they find how much there is to do in San Diego. Many guests visit San Diego as part of an extended trip that includes San Francisco and Los Angeles. They often plan fewer days in San Diego because they assume it is the smallest city with the least to offer only to say they wished they had planned more days in San Diego because it offers more things to do in a much more relaxing environment. By planning ahead you can also get discounts for various attractions. For example you can save a lot of money at SeaWorld if you buy your tickets in advance online, at a visitor center or through your hotel. Another reason to plan ahead is that some attractions close early or get sold out since San Diego is a big destination for major conventions and big companies bringing in employees from around the world for special events in beautiful, sunny San Diego. \n Question: Which of the following is the best title of the passage? \n Options: (A) Brief Introduction to San Diego (B) Tips for Visiting San Diego (C) Attractions in and around San Diego (D) Reasons for Visiting San Diego \n Asnwer: B", "output": "Yes", "category": "Question Answering 938.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank, four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\") and the answer to that question.

For thousands of years, we have been polluting the environment, making it hard for animals to live on the planet. We have been killing animals for their fur, feathers or meat, or simply because they are dangerous. As a result, many kinds of animals have disappeared forever. Hundreds more are on the endangered list today. Should we care about animals? Of course we should. If animals of a certain kind all disappear, they will never come back again. Animals are more than just resources of things we need. Every kind of animal has its place in the balance of nature. Destroying any kind of animal can lead to many problems. For example, when farmers killed large numbers of hawks, the corn and grain that the farmers stored were destroyed by rats and mice. Why?  Because hawks eat rats and mice. With less and less hawks to keep down their numbers, rats and mice multiplied quickly. And if people kill too many birds, more and more insects will eat the crops. Luckily, we've realized that we shouldn't kill animals any more. And people are working hard to save those animals that would disappear soon. The government also passed laws to protect the endangered animals. In fact, quite a few countries have passed such laws. These laws forbid the killing of any kind of animal on the endangered list. We should try our best to protect and save the endangered animals. \n Question: The text calls on us to  _  . \n Options: (A) keep animals at home (B) protect the environment (C) protect the endangered animals (D) know more about the balance of nature. \n Asnwer: A", "output": "No", "category": "Question Answering 938.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank, four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\") and the answer to that question.

For years, female sea turtles have returned to the beaches where they were born to build nests for their next generation. As Miami Beach continues to develop; wildlife officials and volunteers are making sure the beach remains a welcoming place for these endangered animals.  The sea turtle patrol   starts his day at sunrise. \"The reason we need to get out at first light is to make sure we see the tracks before anybody else gets out here, Bill Ahern says, \"Something that weighs 350 pounds is going to leave evidence.\" Bill Ahern directs the sea turtle program in Miami-Dade county. His team monitors and marks nests left by sea turtles who lay eggs in the sand and then return to the sea. The patrols also work with beach residents to keep track of new nests and possible threats to existing ones. Nearly 65,000 turtles nested on Florida's Atlantic coast last year. A tiny part comes to Miami Beach where they face many risks. Tough laws have been passed to punishpoachers . And bright lights from nearby buildings can confuse newly born turtles, attracting them onto roads instead of into the ocean. \"I recall in the mid-1960s, me and my beach buddies(policemen) would pick up hatchlings from the road and put them back in the water,\" he recalls .To avoid that problem, city officials have imposed limits on coastal lighting.   Although most sea turtles hatch on their own, coming out at night, some have a harder time. In the future, the Sea Turtles Program hopes to do away with the hatchery.  Educating beach-goers is a step in that direction. Each week, people are invited to see a release of newly born turtles recovered from nests. The experience helps sunbathers understand the role of the beach in the turtle's life cycle.   \"Only a part of the newly hatched turtles will escape predators and man-made dangers in their first year.\" Their instincts  are so sharp ,\" Ahern says, \"I'll face a turtle to the west, and then watch him, he turns right around ,facing the ocean. \" \n Question: What do Ahern and his sea turtle patrol do in the early morning? \n Options: (A) find tracks left by sea turtles (B) pick up the trash on the beach (C) collect eggs laid by sea turtles (D) exercise to lose weight \n Asnwer: D", "output": "No", "category": "Question Answering 938.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given an article, a question which often contains a blank, four options (associated with \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\") and the answer to that question.

We've been together for two years. I met her during our college days. She was my classmate, but I can tell that we were not so close at that time, maybe because we had our own friends and maybe our attention was always on them, so I didn't even notice her. Yet there were times that she was with me during my lunch break. That is why we slowly became close. We had our lunch together in the boarding house but sometimes not, probably because we had our own friends. And when we took our break, we bought our favorite food together, but not that often since we didn't have enough money. Furthermore, we were together in the student union, which was nice for me to know her better. I can say that she is really a nice friend. She is the kind of person that is very approachable in times of emptiness. She is a friend whom I can call every time I need help. Definitely, I am so glad that I have her.

Also known as red ball, the game was invented in 1893 by German laborers who wished to play polo , but could not afford horses. While the sport has not _ in North America, it is very fashionable in Europe and even Japan. Played in an indoor court, cycle ball is similar to soccer in many ways--the aim is to score as many goals as possible, and only the goalkeeper is allowed to touch the ball. The one big difference? Use of legs is forbidden. Instead, players have to guide the ball across the court, using the front wheels of their bicycles or with their heads. In fact, if a player even touches the floor with his feet during the 14-minute game, it is considered a foul  and the opposing team gets a free kick. While the game was initially  played with normal bikes, things are a little different now. The seats of these specialized bikes are positioned over the back tire and they sport a single fixed gear, making it easier for the rider to control the constant back and forth movement required for the game. The handlebars  also point straight up so that the competitors can sit upright while playing and they are about twice the weight of normal bikes, which helps with the stability. While cycle ball may sound a little strange, it is a fast-paced sport that requires much training, skill, and, is also really fun to watch. \n Question: What does the passage mainly talk about? \n Options: (A) The origin and development of soccer (B) The differences between cycle ball and soccer.

Gomes is one of thousands of young illegal immigrants who grew up in the United States and are now studying at American colleges and universities. He is doing well in his studies, but he is fighting deportation to India, a country he left with his parents when he was just 14 months old. They were deported more than a year ago. \"If I was to go back to India I would just feel like all of that would have gone to waste because here at least I am still able to go to college,\" he said. Immigration is a divisive political issue in the United States with some 11 million people in the country illegally. One element of the debate is the hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants brought to the United States before the age of 16. Pending legislation know as the DREAMAct would give them a chance to become legal residents if they complete two years of college or join the military. Milanie Schwartz, a politically conservative student at the University of Texas, explains why some Americans oppose the legislation. \"We think it's unfair that students who are illegal immigrants would get a fast track to citizenship, while people who did come here legally wouldn't have those same opportunities,\" she said. \"The question is legalization or not, \" said Jon Feere, who also opposes the DREAM Act. He is a policy analyst with the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington and is concerned about the act's effect on the economy.  \"There's a lot of unemployment in the United States right now. And there are already many legal immigrants who are already here who are desperate for those jobs,\" he said. But supporters of the DREAMAct say well-educated immigrants would help the economy. Raul Hinojosa is an immigration research analyst at UCLA.\" Not letting them contribute to the economy would not only lose all the financial investment we have already made in these youths, but we would lose literally trillions of dollars of potential value because they want and are ready to contribute to the US economy,\" he said. That's exactly what Yves Gomes wants to do -- finish school and become a doctor. He says without the DREAMAct, many students' dreams will be lost. \"They are studying at Harvard, they are studying at UCLA--the top universities -- and they all have bright futures and because of the system they are going to be told to go home, go back to a country they don't even know, \" he said. The DREAMAct has failed to win passage in Congress since it was first introduced 10 years ago. Now time is running out for passage this year, and opposition Republicans have threatened to block it.

Once Mom found it was my birthday, she would be sad that she had forgotten and had nothing to give me. She even can't remember what we did two hours ago because of dementia . Birthdays are not a big deal to me. I hate growing older. I don't mind if Mom forgets my birthday as long as she still remembers me. That someday she might not recognize me has been my biggest fear ever since Mom got dementia. I can't imagine anything more devastating than being forgotten by my own mother. When Mom was diagnosed with vascular dementia seven years ago, I was told she did not have Alzheimer's disease . I hoped that meant she would never forget her family. But as Mom's dementia progressed, I realized that I had no idea whether vascular dementia could be as bad as Alzheimer's. I really didn't understand the difference.

A language can become extinct when the last person who can speak it passes away. Or more likely when the secondlast person who speaks it dies because then there is no one left to talk to. According to linguists   there is nothing unusual about a single language dying out. But what is happening today is quite remarkable. According to the recent statistics, there are approximately 6,000 languages in the world as we speak. Of these, about half are going to die out in the next century. There are several reasons as to why a language can eventually die out. These range from natural disasters, such as hurricanes, to sociological factors, like cultural assimilation, in which the culture of a minority group is gradually replaced by a stronger one. The former can cause tribes to leave their natural habitat  and therefore become fewer and fewer in number. However, it doesn't happen very frequently. In fact, the latter is a much bigger threat and it is responsible for the extinction of a lot of languages in countries like the USA and Australia. For instance, Chemehuevi is one of the languages which is really close to dying out since its sole speaker is an old, yet healthy, man named Johnny Hill, Jr. It is very important for as many languages as possible to be preserved. Scientists have been trying to raise people's awareness on how certain tribes have specific words which cannot be expressed in let's say English simply because there is no equal meaning. Namely, the Yupik of Alaska have 99 names to describe different layers of ice formation, or how the Tofa of Siberia classify reindeer  . In other words, when languages die out, mankind's wisdom reduces. On a happier note, there are many famous cases which show what can be done to preserve languages in danger of extinction. In particular, the Maori in New Zealand have created socalled \"language nests\": organizations which help children under five learn the language. They provide them with a setting where they are exposed to the language intensively so that they get to realise that communicating in Maori is as natural as communicating in English. There is always, of course, the risk that the children won't keep the language alive after they have left their \"nests\". Nevertheless, hope dies hard. \n Question: What most probably caused the death of languages in the USA and Australia? \n Options: (A) Habitats were lost. (B) Natural disasters struck.
