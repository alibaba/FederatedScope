They took a little extra time to pair to my Pixel XL but overall pairing wasn't that bad. Charged them overnight to ensure they had a full charge. I tried the small earbuds first but they wouldn't hold in my ears. Switched to the medium earbuds for a better fit then started some music. Sound quality was horrible! I kept fiddling with settings on my phone trying to increase the volume and sound quality to no avail. As a last resort I switched to the large earbuds - what a difference! Once a true fit is found the sound quality is actually very good. The music never stopped or skipped over 8 hours while I did my yard work and they had approximately 40% charge left. I charged them overnight again then used them for a 2.5 mile walk. There were a few skips but I thought it might have been my stream. Then I used them for a 5 mile walk...they were dropping out every 20 mins or so and they earbuds seemed to lose pair with each other. First the right ear would drop, it would come back and immediately the left would drop for a second before reconnecting. The problem only got worse as I continued to use them. The last time I used them, I had them on for 2 hours and they skipped over 2 dozen times while the unpairing from right to left earbud happened at least 13 times. I quit using them and purchased some Jabras. I thought I found a deal but it seems I found a dud. \n Category: grocery", "output": "False", "category": "Text Categorization 425.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a review from Amazon and category of the product based on the review given by the user and your task is classify whether the given category match the review.

But the dogs all looked at me, as though I was threatening to beat them. And our Black Lab... Which I honestly cannot remember when he's EVER turned down anything offered to him to eat. Perhaps they were starting to go rancid??? Though I couldn't smell anything. But I know with dry food, once it is exposed to oxygen, it starts going rancid within 2 weeks. Which is why I only keep out enough for a little over a week, then freeze the rest. I don't know if everyone else's came like mine. But the giant bag it all came in, was open, thus exposed to oxygen. Anyway, with none of the dogs wanting to eat it, I have no choice but to return. And since it's the 20lb box, inside of ANOTHER box...

That being said . . . . I was looking forward to watching the British series. I was very disappointed in the screen adaptation of the book. The series is so different from the book that it's hard to watch. I wonder what Ken Follett thought of the way his book was butchered. I know it's a long book but It could have been handled a little differently instead of changing the story to fit the time slot. \n Category: other", "output": "True", "category": "Text Categorization 425.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a review from Amazon and category of the product based on the review given by the user and your task is classify whether the given category match the review.

Attempted pairing on multiple devices, different iPhones and iPads thinking maybe it was just my iPhone, it wasn't. 2. Device updates are very delayed / latent - as in minutes, sometimes as much as 10-15 minutes. This is supposed to be a sensor that operates in near real time, not sure what the deal is? 3. Automation in Homekit is unreliable. Set up a very simple routine, when it senses movement, turn on the lights. The sensor would blip that it picked up motion - half the time, it would not trigger the automation routine at all. Other times, the latency to trigger the lights would range from 10 seconds to as much as a minute. What's the purpose of that? I'll just turn the lights on manually if it's going to take THAT long. This can't be with Homekit, it's got to be with this manufacturer. With my Lutron set-up, when I turn on the lights through the Homekit app, theres almost imperceptible lag time and 100% reliability to trigger actions, as it should be. \n Category: home_improvement", "output": "True", "category": "Text Categorization 425.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a review from Amazon and category of the product based on the review given by the user and your task is classify whether the given category match the review.

Just anything that could connect my mic and piano to my computer should be fine. Well, I don't know how anyone anywhere has ever used this product. I'm so disappointed I bought it instead of something else because now I have to wait for the new product to arrive and have to return this one. I use a MacBook Pro and it immediately was recognized when I plugged it in. That's where any positives end. The hissing sound from the mic port, even when no mic is plugged in, is unbearable with any gain. Without gain, you can't hear or use the mic. The piano was even worse. No hissing sound, but any chord or combination of keys resulted in a terrible distortion, even with the gain at its lowest. Worst of all, even with the volume all the way up, the instruments were too quiet. I miss my Fast Track Pro desperately. Buying something else and hopefully it will work. You may as well use your computer mic before buying this piece of garbage.

This product is basically of no use to us now due to the material that spreads all over the house-which the dogs could potentially eat.
