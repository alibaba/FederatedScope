For months, Disney advertised this as a 2-Disc Special Edition DVD. But at the last minute, that second disc mysteriously disappeared. WHY? This is false advertising, and if I had my way, Disney would have a big fat lawsuit on their hands. It's unfair to force people who really want a 2-Disc to pay very expensive import prices to get one from the UK and to those of us who don't own a region-free player. They did this same crap to Alice In Wonderland, but the other way around. UK lost a disc that we have, and Paramount and Fox have done this to US fans of Titanic by dropping the 2-and-4-disc editions in the US, but not in the UK, and giving fans in the US a 3-Disc edition. I don't understand why these movie companies can't be consistent with their international releases and simply make a single version available for all people all over the world.    Unfortunately, I have chosen not to buy this crappy excuse for a \"Special Edition\" DVD. I do not appreciate being lied to. I still love Disney movies as well as the excellent DVD editions, when Disney actually releases the product they've advertised for months, and I will continue to buy the QUALITY DVD releases, but I do not enjoy false advertisement", "output": "NEG", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1104.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given product reviews about dvds.

Saving Private Ryan is an inspirational film filled with dyanamic battle-scenes, drama and action. During the opening scene into the storyline there is a fantastic 20-minute depiction of one bloodiest battles of WWII fought at Omaha Beach. Not only is it gruesome in its depiction of the thoughts of these soldiers who fought during this war but it also has an subplot filled with the notion of brotherhood. Tom Hanks performance was phenomenal as well as the rest of the cast which includes such notable names as: Edward Burns, Tom Seizmore, etc. Their performances work simultenously to make you believe in this mission: saving one man.     The storyline is simple, Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) has been assigned a mission from the General George C. Marshall. The mission's objective: Finding Private James Francis Ryan from Iowa, whose 3 other brothers have been K.I.A. (Killed in Action). Conflict: Private Ryan is somewhere in Normandy. Where? No one exactly knows. Like Captain Miller says: \"It's like finding a needle in a stack of needles.\"    Yet as they embark on this mission they are met with some obstacles along the way. Losing men as they go, many start to question the value of their mission and if saving one man is worth the lives of many others. It comes to a culminating end, one that might leave you with a tear or two.     If you love war movies, drama, or like the period itself, I highly recommend you go out and watch this movie.", "output": "POS", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1104.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given product reviews about dvds.

This film genuinely surprised me when I first saw it in theaters in 1992.  For me, Bridget Fonda was the main draw at the time, as she received top billing and was on the movie posters with Matt Dillion.  It felt like a bait and switch, because the film focuses more on Campbell Scott and Kyra Sedgwick's relationship, even though they aren't featured on the poster.  That's no biggie, because I enjoyed their storyline much more than Bridget and Matt's...but I bet Campbell and Kyra weren't happy to be excluded on the poster/DVD cover.    This film has it all...great music suitable to the period (grunge/alternative), fantastic use of place (Seattle in a starring role), interesting and quirky characters, and true to life portrayal of young people in their twenties negotiating through life as they find their true passions.  I especially loved Campbell Scott's performance and he is the true star of this film.  His job is working on creating a \"Super Train\" to get Seattlites out of their cars and onboard for their commute, because he believes that \"if you give them great coffee and great music, they'll ride.\"  His girlfriend, played by Kyra Sedgwick, has her pulse on the masses, by telling him, \"I still love my car, though.\"  She's an environmentalist who drives an old gass guzzling clunker of an automobile, which Campbell pokes fun at after a lunch date.  Its a joy to watch their relationship grow from initial doubts to lover games about how soon after a date one should call to other challenges that crop up.  I especially love the scene when Linda (Sedgwick) peruses Steve's (Campbell Scott) record albums and gets nostalgic about her college days.  That scene epitomizes the exciting \"getting to know you\" stage of dating and rings absolutely true.  The choice of music in that scene, and throughout the entire movie really enhances the scenes overall.    Probably the only thing I didn't like about the film, which is just a tiny critique, was Janet's (Fonda) almost groupie-like infatuation with Cliff (Dillon), who didn't seem all that interested in her (until she moves on with her life).  They are a mismatched pair if there ever was one...Janet with her ambitions for Grad School to pursue architecture, and Cliff the stereotypical Gen X slacker working menial jobs to support his rock band career that probably wouldn't have gone anywhere.  Janet should have hooked up with the plastic surgeon who doesn't know how to have fun!    This dvd would be made even better with a director's commentary track.  Cameron Crowe could divulge a lot of interesting information and insite jokes that the average filmwatcher might not catch (like when the mime says, \"wooo woooo woooo\" in response to a guy who says he works for Boeing, or when a reporter asks Cliff what the song \"Touch Me, I'm Dick\" is about--which is an inside joke on the actual song \"Touch Me, I'm Sick\").  This film is so ingrained into the grunge culture of Seattle of the early 1990s, that future audiences could use a lot of background info a director's commentary would provide.  At any rate, this film is a joy to watch, and cheaply priced that it's worth having in one's collection.

I wasn't sure what I would think of this movie, but I found it to be an interesting snapshot of post-Soviet Russian life. It showed how easy it is to slip into criminal life when the opportunity presents itself.     The movie was also an interesting discussion on morality. Danila was not a bad guy, though he did fit into the criminal world well. He still did what he could for those who had nothing. It was, at times, hard to reconcile the cold-blooded killer and the compassionate young man.     The movie showed and interesting dynamic between the two Danilas. There was also the family dynamic; his brother was willing to put Danila's life in danger. Desperate times call for desperate measures.    Overall, the movie was entertaining. It was heavy, but with a few lighter spots so the viewer doesn't get overwhelmed.", "output": "POS", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1104.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given product reviews about dvds.

Let's face it, what can I possibly say about Robert Rossen's exquisitely hard-edged classic that hasn't been said before?  \"The Hustler\" is an astounding and uncompromising drama that seems as fresh today as it did 45 years ago.  So often we'll look back at the classics--and, as is appropriate, they might seem dated.  Times change and that is reflected in cinema.  \"The Hustler,\" though, is one of the rare films that was so sophisticated, so intelligent, and so honestly raw--that its power has not been diminished by the years.  Set in a very unglamorous world of pool halls and back rooms, \"The Hustler\" is a testosterone fueled excursion into the life and pursuits of one of Hollywood's most notorious anti-heroes--Fast Eddie Felson.  Nominated for eight Oscars, this refreshingly adult film cemented Paul Newman's status as one of our greatest actors.    The story of \"The Hustler\" is surprisingly simplistic.  A brash young pool shark sets his sights on defeating one of the game's greatest players--Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason, at his best).  But getting up on Fats isn't enough--no, he wants to crush his opponent.  Eddie's naked and uncompromising drive eventually becomes his undoing as his winning streak turns to defeat.  Despondent and broke, Eddie aligns with an equally desperate love interest.  Sarah, played by Piper Laurie (never better), is a bitter alcoholic who has given up on life.  But her complicated romance with Eddie seems to hint at the possibility of new hope.  Eddie, however, can't change his spots overnight and an encounter with an unscrupulous manager (George C. Scott) just might get Eddie a second chance at Fats.  For good or for bad, it seems Eddie is destined to go down that road again.    Paul Newman imbues Eddie with much cockiness, bravado, arrogance, ambition, and even desperation.  In my opinion, it is Newman's best and most multi-layered performance.  This (along with \"Hud\") celebrated Newman as a new type of leading man--someone you could like and despise at once.  Morally questionable, perhaps even amoral at times, Newman was not afraid to be despicable.  While only Oscar nominated for this film, ironically he won roughly 25 years later for reprising Eddie for \"The Color of Money.\"  Laurie, Scott, and Gleason all picked up Oscar nods as well.  The film is impeccably acted and beautifully filmed.  Not just for those with an interest in pool, \"The Hustler\" is a searing drama that stands as a deft character study of a man figuring out what is important after all.    While the Collector's Edition seems to be handsomely packaged as a two disc set, whether or not it's worth the upgrade from the Special Edition seems a bit suspect.  Both have widescreen presentation, commentary from Newman and \"Time\" film critic Richard Schickel (among others), and features on \"How to Make The Shot\" and \"The Hustler: The Inside Story.\"  This new addition adds four featurettes--\"Life in the Fast Lane: Fast Eddie Felson and The Search for Greatness,\" \"Milestones in Cinema History: The Making of The Hustler,\" \"Swimming with Sharks: The Art of the Hustle,\" and \"Paul Newman: Hollywood's Cool Hand.\"  So it's a judgment call whether or not you feel these extra shorts will add to your viewing experience.  If you don't own the film, then it's a no-brainer!  Either way, \"The Hustler\" is a true classic.  One of Newman's best (if not best) performances make this gritty and timeless drama a must own DVD.

I really thought it was well done and would have enjoyed it just for the music. I guess it depends on what you are looking for as to weather or not you will like it. I watched on a regular TV with a $100 DVD player and thought it was great. Someone else may watch on a $10,000 TV and system and may still not be impressed.  I looked at another DVD review that was mentioned and highly recommended by someone that didn't like this one, yet that DVD only had 2 reviews and not good.. So just a matter of taste and perhaps the digital age has made it very hard to impress a person.   I feel the DVD does what it was meant to do, provide some relaxing music with some wonderful scenes, perhaps the title Illuminated Manuscripts explains the writings and emblems that appear in the video.   Perhaps if you are able to watch some clips you will know if it's for you or even check out the more recent Ritual Path. I come from a rock music background and don't feel that I'm easily impressed but from my personal viewing I would recommend both the Illuminated Manuscripts or the Ritual Path.
