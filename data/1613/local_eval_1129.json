However, there is no mention of this in the movie whatsoever. There are two possibilities: 1) That the spider in the film was also part of some lab experiments based on the blood of Peter Parker of that universe (the one who dies). 2) That the spider came from another universe. The question then is \"how did the spider get to the universe before the portal was opened?\". The answer to that would be \"The spider came from another universe and traveled back in time just like Gwen did\". However, to keep things simple, we can assume that Oscorp was up to no good and were experimenting with Peter's blood and Miles got bit by it. We already know that happened in the comics.  <sep>  Q: Which dimension did the radioactive spider which bit Miles come from?
