But I did (after some thought) choose to give it two stars, rather than one, so let me explain why:\\n\\nThe food wasn't terrible.  It was bland and uncreative.  I ordered the red beans and rice with andouille sausage.  The hearty portion of it that I was served was pretty good, but under-salted and perhaps under-seasoned, in general.  The highlight of the meal might have been our appetizer of Bourbon Hot Wings, which were nice and meaty with a good, spicy sauce coating them.\\n\\nWhat was really more atrocious than the food at The Bayou was the decor and the service.  Michael R. noted that the murals on the inside walls of the restaurant are tacky and touristy.  I'll give him that, but my bigger complaint was the furniture.  The restaurant is entirely indoors, and yet the only table/chair options are metal \\\"\"grate\\\"\" patio furniture!  Great for an evening outdoors (and necessary, I understand, if you need weather resistant pieces), but uncomfortable and unnecessary indoors. \\n\\nAnd the service was slow.  It took our server a long time to seat us, and to bring us our drinks.  The appetizer was slow coming out, as was the main course.  The time in between service and the obligatory check-in (\\\"\"how is everything?\\\"\") was long, as well, which was unfortunate because it meant that we didn't even get salt on our table until we were halfway through our main course.  The slow service also meant that when I was unsatisfied with my drink (I ordered an Old Fashioned.  What they served me was a watery glass of whiskey with seemingly no other flavoring), it took a while to exchange it (for the Nola Cola, which was actually quite good).\\n\\nTwo stars or one, the bottom line on The Bayou is probably still: don't bother.", "output": "NEGATIVE", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1102.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given Yelp reviews.

What I didn't realize was that the waitress meant to say I ordered a 5 on a scale of 1-100, cause this didn't have any spice at all. bleh...\\n\\nAfter a few bites I calmly explained that on a scale of 1 to 7 that my dish was more like a 0, no spice at all.

Instead of waiting for 30 minutes, I asked if she could bring me some thai chili peppers and some chili paste to add to my dish, I'd just take care of it myself instead; she showed up with chili oil and soy sauce. :-/ Thanks, I guess. I pushed through, spiced up my dish to satisfaction and 'enjoyed' the rest of my meal, but mostly the conversation with my friend and not really the meal or the dining experience. \\n\\nMy friends dish was pretty sub satisfactory to her, and she asked the waitress to just take it back. The waitress didn't seem to want to just take the dish from the table and leave it at that, after insisting on making a new dish to replace the unsatisfactory dish about five times. Instead of just returning the dish, she gave in to the waitress and selected something different. While her replacement dish was better, but not awesome, she ended up getting charged for the replacement dish she didn't really want to begin with.\\n\\nGiven the choice, next time I'll aim for taco bell.

After our name was on the waiting list, (40 minutes) I could not find a place to sit, so I thought there may be room to sit in the ladies room. On my way to the bathroom I had to wade through about 50 servers milling about in the aisles. This is a big location, but there is no way they need a staff of 200 inexperienced servers to stand around looking confused in groups of two.\\n\\nWe did wait less than the predicted time, but I think that was due to the fact that the people in line before us were no where to be found when their names were called. We were seated at a decent table, but the building is loud and overcrowded, so we couldn't hear each other talking. That makes a meal awkward enough, but we were also being interrupted constantly by servers delivering items to our table that were meant for other tables.\\n\\nOur server was nice and tried his best, but I think in general they trained these servers to up sell and serve wine samples, but not on practical things like table numbers or order timing. When I saw the new menu, it made more sense since they are obviously all about the money, money, money. The prices have gone up! I suppose they need more money to help them pay the cost of the new building and maintaining an army of untrained servers to run around being useless and blocking fire exits all the time.\\n\\nOur entrees were served before we had a chance to eat our salad and the appetizer came out 10 minutes after that. I guess they were going for a reverse dining experience. The food came out so fast and inappropriately timed that I felt we were being rushed out. Combined with the loud atmosphere and the numerous people stopping by the table it felt like eating at a parody of a good  restaurant.\\n\\nThe food itself, while served way too quickly, was also not very good. I am a fan of Olive Garden, so I am not sure if they changed the menu or it is just being executed poorly. The salad was gross and rubbery, my fettuccini was bland and my boyfriend's ziti was so salty he was draining Lake Mead with all the water refills. \\n\\nThe appetizer was okay, but honestly I'll eat pretty much anything as long as you deep fry it. Additionally, it is hard to enjoy an appetizer when it comes out after you've already started your actual meal. With that much food on the table you start to realize how much you are pigging out right now. Nobody wants to be reminded of the call to Jenny Craig they will have to make as a result of this one meal. The server did apologize for this, but no one offered to take the appetizer off the bill... or even to take it back. Just shut up and eat your pile of food, fatty.\\n\\nEven though there were people everywhere throwing food at us and asking us how we were doing at the beginning of the meal, they all disappeared at check time. I guess they get yelled at a lot for those sneaky upsells? The manager came by after several minutes, but we just wanted to give them our money and leave by then. Honestly, this Olive Garden needs to call its birth mother and get some guidance about how to win at being a real restaurant. Maybe we will try it again in a year.

I ended up exchanging it because I didn't care for it, dry, over-herbed which was strange because it almost was bland. \\n\\nToday I went with some coworkers and had the lunch special. For about $8.50 you get the chicken burger with bacon, lettuce, tomato, pickle herbed aioli- more mayo textured, pimento cheese served on a delicious bun.

That sums up my two experiences with this Dunkin' Donuts. \\n\\nThis location is right around the corner from my house. We are not  donut connoisseurs or food snobs so our expectations are pretty fair and reasonable. We usually buy donuts from Walmart or Albertsons but will make a trip out to Krispy Kreme on occasion. We are big junk food eaters though so when my wife and I first heard a Dunkin' Donuts was going into the shopping plaza we were very excited. The day it opened there was some buzz in our neighborhood and within a few days we stopped in with the family.\\n\\nMy first thought was disappointment in the variety and selection. Years ago when I use to visit a different Dunkin' Donuts on a semi-regular basis I really enjoyed all the different types of donuts from jelly and kreme filled to glazed and chocolate cake. They didnt have chocolate or bavarian kreme filled. None of the chocolate covered cake donuts. Frankly the selection is much better at the Super Walmart down the road.\\n\\nWe quickly picked a dozen donuts and headed home eager to dig in. Again, we were only disappointed. The vanilla kreme filled donuts were incredibly skimpy on filling. The glazed donuts were dense and not light and fluffy. Two days later we ended up throwing away 4 left over donuts and that has NEVER happened in this house.\\n\\nThe second trip was nearly identical. We were disappointed by the selection and the taste/quality was an even bigger disappointment. I can only assume they must be trying to cut costs by being so skimpy with the donut filling. \\n\\nIn passing conversations with others in our neighborhood they've expressed similar experiences. We will not be returning for a third trip. Its back to Walmart and Albertson's donuts until Krispy Kreme builds a store a little closer to our house.

Not only is their no restaurant in this hotel (they have a pool bar that can microwave a burger from Sysco for you if you are brave), they are going to spend the entire time trying to market to you and get you to buy a timeshare.  I mean the entire time.\\n\\nI received 3 phone calls every day in the room, and numerous messages.  And if you don't respond to those messages and delete them, they will remind you at the front desk that you have the messages.  Then, they sell your email address to their partners, who will put together countless emails to send to you that look like they were designed by a fifth grader who just learned that color text and font sizes are a thing.  I am surprised that the Marriott brand allows such tasteless emails to be sent out to its guests - not for the promotion, I know everybody needs to make a buck here and there - but for the sheer lack of quality in the emails from this person Kacee.  Fuzzy picture of the hotel's logo at the top, obviously a screen grab, highlighted text, numerous font sizes and colors.  Just hack.\\n\\nAnyways, back to the hotel - you get a spacious room, each is what they call a 'villa'.  Thought the term is misused, you can think of it as a large space, with three rooms (a sitting space with TV and a small, tasteful kitchen, a bedroom, and a bathroom) in the one-bedroom version.  The cost is reasonable for what is included, though since it is not attached to any of the casinos or anything like that, you will be wanting to spend your time elsewhere (less you have to deal with all the promotions and endless phone messages).  \\n\\nThe hotel lies across the street from PH casino and resort, which is a nice example of the LV strip.  You of course have to trudge through an underground parking garage for about a 1/4 mile to get to the casino through a back entrance (watch out for delivery and trash trucks making the rounds down there, almost got hit!)  There are some great little restaurants, some tackier cheap restaurants, and a shopping mall that I did not wander in to but I heard was nice.  Played a little blackjack, lost some money, had some drinks - all in all a good time (at PH...)\\n\\nSo in summation - it sucks that this is a timeshare property, will absolutely not be coming back here again.  The sales and marketing on site are relentless, and though I am not going to pretend they are high and holy, I am surprised that Marriott is okay with its brand getting tainted by hacker-y such as this.  Now my email has been sold to some crap company, so I have that to look forward to.  \\n\\nI stay in Marriott's around the country, about 100+ days a year for work and play, and this was by far the most annoying.  But if you don't have an email account, rip your room phone our of the wall, and don't interact with any of the staff on your way out the door to more interesting places on the strip, you will have a great time and save a little money!

Another doctor, Dr Turner then did a pelvic exam because of my melt down, realized their diagnosis was wrong, pulled the tissue out with forceps, then told me to LEAVE AND COME BACK for another ultrasound so they could charge me again.

Said packet consisted of the Egg Donor Information Sheet, Supplementary Questionnaire, Authorization to Release Medical Records, Egg Donor Agreement, and Travel Guidelines, and .  My issues lie with this last document.\\n\\nThe travel guidelines, state that if travel is required for retrieval (which usually is) \\\"\"TWEB will have a companion who will be designated by TWEB share your hotel room with you.  You will have separate beds.  Family and friends cannot be companions.  If they wish to accompany the donor, it will be at their cost with a separate hotel room.\\\"\"  This is absolutely absurd.  In past experience, EVERY OTHER agency that I have dealt with allows for a family member or friend of the donor to accompany the donor with all of their travel expenses paid for.  How do they expect a donor to feel comfortable sleeping in the same hotel room with some random stranger in a strange city (or foreign country).  This shows that they have absolutely no consideration or concern for the donor and raises a HUGE red flag.  I raised this issue with the \\\"\"Donor Coordinator\\\"\" who basically just said, \\\"\"well that's our policy, we'll delete your application, good luck.\\\"\"\\n\\nSo my recommendation is to NOT sign on with this agency.  Virtually ANY other agency out their will compensate you higher compensation, TWEB's compensation is $3,500-$5,000 per cycle, ANY other agency will compensate $5000-$10,000 per cycle, anything less than $5,000 is just insulting considering the time and effort that goes into these cycles, especially if you are an EXPERIENCED, PROVEN donor. and ANY other agency will look out for your best interest/ want you to feel comfortable.  ANY other agency will allow for you to bring a companion of your choice to the retrieval, reimburse you for more expenses, and allow a more generous \\\"\"per diem\\\"\" when you are traveling.

Had they not been in the laughable City North, I might have given them an extra star, but they're not, so two it is.  When we came, it was pretty much empty except for a couple tables out on the patio because it was nice out.  We elected to sit outside too.\\n\\nThis first thing I hated was their menus.  You get this huge board game sized piece of paper sandwiched between two pieces of plexiglass and then held together with a thick rubber band.  They just seemed tacky!  Obviously, I came here for the burgers, so I read through my options and decided that build my own was the way to go.  I started getting hesitant about the price, because just a couple add ons were going to make my burger cost about 15 bucks or so.  It better be good.\\n\\nI settled on a sirloin burger with barbecue sauce, crispy onions, and bacon.  We also got an order of fries to share (also quite expensive.)  The fries were just okay, but I did like the seasoning.  It just needed more.  The burger on the other hand was a HUGE let down.  Just because you give me a massive patty plopped between a sky high bun does not make the value any better.  The patty itself was at least an inch and a half thick, so when I requested my burger to be cooked medium, I got something closer to well done around the outside with only a sliver of pink on the inside.  Not so cool.  The burger itself was very bland.  You can't just throw ground sirloin on a grill and call it a burger.  There needs to be some love and seasoning or else it just won't work.  I did like the barbecue sauce, but that was it.  The bacon had no flavor and added nothing in terms of texture, unless you want to call tough and chewy an improvement.  The crispy onions, my most anticipated feature, were actually the worse.  It seemed to me like they were fried way in advance, allowed to cool, and then stuck on there.  They were cold, tough, and stringy.  Obviously, this was unappetizing.\\n\\nI ate about a quarter of my burger, making a huge mess because of the astronomical proportions, before I decided that it just wasn't worth it.

The salesperson was awesome!  In fact, we returned on our anniversary and upgraded my stone.  Unfortunately they closed most of their locations and we had to mail my rings in to get checked every 6 months to keep the lifetime warranty that we paid for.  When we moved to AZ, I was excited to find a location in Paradise Valley mall.  Originally my center stone was 5/8 ct and we upgraded to 1.1 ct, but they used the same prongs.  My stone came loose and almost fell out at least 5-7 times over a 4 year period.  Well they closed the PV location so I went to this location in Fry's Marketplace.  The staff seemed nice.  I had my rings checked in May and the stone was loose again and they had to keep it for a week to fix it.  I explained my ongoing problem with the stone and my fear of losing it.  I told them that if it happened again I wanted a new prong put on.  I went to have my rings checked on 12/14 (which ironically was our anniversary) and the stone was loose and they had to keep it to put a new prong on.  Katherine assured me the ring would be ready in 48 hours and if they had to order a prong, it would be 72 hours.  I wasn't happy about this and let her know my frustration and that we live at Anthem and it's quite a drive to come back for the rings.  I actually spent $326 on 2 necklaces and left.  I called on 12/17 and spoke to Katherine and she told me my rings were ready.  My husband drove all the way over and they were NOT ready!  In fact they told him they had to order the prong and it wouldn't even be there until Thursday and the ring wouldn't be ready until Friday or Saturday.  The Sales rep had nerve to tell my husband that there was no pick up date on the ticket and we should have called first.  Really?  So I called and spoke to Mannette who informed me that I would need to call and speak to Katherine tomorrow.  I expressed how upset I was and that I feel the ring we purchased for $7500 is junk and I want some sort of compensation.  She informed me they could mail it to me.  Are you kidding??

Especialy love the wallpaper and the \\\"\"let's nhau\\\"\" quote (vietnamese for let's party/drink) in the corner of the room. There's also a huge bar that greets you and FOURTEEN flat screen tv's all over the place. It's totally set up for some good eating, drinking, and sport gatherings.\\n\\nThe CAFE SUA DA (Vietnamese iced coffee) was perfect. I am a coffee lover, and I'm extra critical. But they nailed the coffee here. Strong and sweet.\\n\\nAppetizers: the GARLIC AND SERRANO PEPPER WINGS are good. Comes out hot, crispy, and moist on the inside. The serrano pepper definitely gives it a kick. And the side of pickled radish adds a nice touch too. The SHAKEN BEEF SALAD comes out on a huge bed of lettuce and tomatoes. The beef is sweet, salty, and savory at the same time. The beef could be more tender, but flavor wise, it was exellent. We also asked for a side of lemon, salt and pepper to dip the meat which really enhanced everything.\\n\\nEntree: the STEAK AND EGG is where some of the asian fusion comes out. It's not the traditional t-bone steak you might expect. It's actually more like the shaken beef appetizer.  But the flavor is more sweet. This beef actually is more tender though. And the fried egg, which was over easy, was actually over easy!! *clap clap. The SLOW BRAISED PORK BELLY IN YOUNG COCONUT JUICE was a little on the smaller side for an entree. Also, the flavor was not as intense as I would have anticipated. It needed more bang, more salt. The OX TAIL PHO came with two big pieces of tender ox tail. It was so tasty and actually fell off the bone. Curiously, the pho tasted like Pho So 1. Which is also a restaurant in chinatown that does very well for itself.\\n\\nOverall, this place has the potential to be great. I can imagine coming here to watch the game and grabbing a few drinks after work. The staff is young and friendly. And occasionally, the chef comes out to see how everyone is doing. That's so cool.

We turned to Yelp for a carryout place and saw the reviews. My hubbie and I were pleasantly surprised. We placed the order and it was ready in ten minutes. The food came home piping hot. Salsa and chips were yummy. I had a chicken chimichanga smothered in guacamole and sour cream. The chicken in the chimichanga burrito consisted of all white meat - moist and flavorful. \\n\\nMy husband had a combo plate - an enchilada, relleno, rice, beans and beef taco. I think the relleno was wrapped in a corn tortilla, not the traditional egg batter. It was a bit strange.  The green chili itself was flavorful. Being from NM, I am used to a red sauce being made from red chili powder. I could not quite distinguish what the sauce was made from that covered the enchilada.  \\n\\nAll in all the food was quite tasty and reasonable for the amount of food we received.

Why the course is nice and very well deserve a 4. The condition is not a 4 cos they are closing down to do reseeding very soon. So you know how bad the course is... no you don't? well let me see if i can make you understand. Its in fact the last weekend that i have play prior to closing down for reseed. no body fill up the fairway, its browning bad and the tee off makes you think you are Phil Mickelson... hell yea they don't stop. The layout is nice thought, design and build a course on a flat dessert land is tough, there is some contour to the course. Greens are awful again cos its closing. inconsistent greens, some are quick and some a snail slow. Signature hole for me? its the hole 9 PAR 5 where the tee box sits lower than the fairway. left is the range so don't get to close or else you will see lots of yellow balls. but that's not the point its hazardous cos you might be the target from the people practicing. if you have the length and height on your tee, its a very reachable 2. Water hazard guards the green so if you don't have a wet suite you might want to consider an easy 3 on. the green is oblong shape and it position the long side perpendicular to you going at it in 2. oh yea its a slightly dog leg left so if you follow the shape then you will have ample of green for a chip and run. The tee for that day was tug way left and any draw while attacking the PIN will leave the ball in the water. Will i go back and play... i would probably say YES. on a side note, the pro shop guy is a DICK, in fact most of the pro shop guys are DICK heads, they look cool and project themselves like they are the PROS, but no offence, they are just wage earners and spend most of the time around a golf course.  so pls put a smile and greet instead of cool ass look and started to argue when there is a different view point.\\n\\nEdited Nov 3 2013:-\\nThis 10 weeks trip of mine gave me ample of opportunity to golf in Az. Its  the perfect weather to be around here to golf. my second game here in Lone Tree forces me to drop my rating from 4 to 2. I will play here again, due to miss communication arrangement. So visitors with tight schedule, pls skip this course. The reseeding forces me to pay $60 instead of $25 (that's what i paid before reseeding). This is a money oriented course/management. The green wasn't even cut after reseed; partly to blame the stupid golfer (including me) to play at a green speed of no more than 4. can you imagine? golf ball is like mini while basketball, can't stop hoping the moment it bounces of your putter on the green. i hate it when course management don't bother to keep their reputation. It kills fun experience and get bad reviews like this. Very short term business people behind the counter of the pro shop. If not shut down the course at least let us know before we pay and play exactly what the conditions are. \\n\\nanyway i like the course but due to the management i will drop from 4 to 3 then further to 2. and i will not recommend any visitors playing here. the risk of getting an unpleasant game here is high. and its not a cheap course to play.", "output": "NEGATIVE", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1102.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given Yelp reviews.

Seated immediately.  Newly remodeled, although still ugly.  Ordered the tap beer featured on their nightly specials flier (Rush River Double Bubble Imperial IPA)  and was really looking forward to it.  Turns our they were out of it, and suggested the Furthermore Fatty Boomballatty as an alternative.  I opted to look at the menu again, but ended up taking the suggestion because nothing else stood out as better.  I was disappointed, but mostly I wasn't happy that they were out of their featured beer at 5p.m. on a Saturday night - they should have had the foresight to cross that off the menu.\\n\\nMy other half ordered the hot buttered rum for her alcoholic beverage of choice.  I thought it was a bad choice to order for a pre-dinner drink, and she thought it was too clove heavy.  It was fine, but I would recommend it more as a dessert drink on a cold night.\\n\\nWe decided on the jalapeno superbird app because someone else said it was good. and then we'd split the Sat. night dinosaur beef rib special for an entree.\\n\\nThe app. came out and it was impressively large for $5.99.  Presentation was nice as well.  No complaints about the taste either.  I was worried that I would be full before the entree arrived, so we decided to take half home with us.  Would I order it again?  No, it was nothing special.  3 stars on the app.\\n\\nThe entree came out.  It was just one huge rib, as the name of the special implies.  It came on it's own plate, with a side of mashed potatoes and broccoli on another plate.  The waitress brought out another plate as well, so we could share.  The meat was very fatty, but also very tender and moist - it was sitting in a pool of oil, which was slightly unappealing.  We picked away the fat and tried to eat the meaty parts.  The barbecue sauce had a slight kick to it, and was overly sodium heavy - an unnecessary but typical casualty of most food in most restaurants - I could tell I would be very thirsty later, and I would feel lousy and bloated because of this meal (In hindsight, I was right).  Why do I do this to myself?\\n\\nWe finished the rib, minus the 1/3 of it that was fat. Meanwhile, we ate the mashed potatoes and broccoli.  The potatoes were lumpy, with plenty of skin - I like that, but of course they were way too salty.  The broccoli came in very large pieces, was very salty and buttery, and was a tad undercooked - I guess that's better than overcooked.  With that said, what a boring side.  Color it up with some carrots or something, for presentation sake!  Interestingly, the broccoli and mashed potatoes were exactly the same as what one would receive at Monty's Blue Plate Diner.  I guess Foodfight Inc. shares their recipes across multiple venues - that's ok, provided what they serve is actually good.  \\n\\nThe service was completely uninspired and I didn't feel like it was appreciated that we chose to dine at their establishment.  This makes a difference to me.\\n\\nTab was $38 plus tip.  I would have felt better paying $28, any even better if we had skipped the experience all together and cooked at home.\\n\\nBot tome line - this is not high quality food, prepared healthily enough for anyone to eat regularly and still maintain a healthy lifestyle.  Foodfight should get a clue, and so should Madisonians who review this place highly.  If you can't tell already, I don't think highly of Bluephies, and for that matter, I don't have anything better to say about any Foodfight Inc. restaurant I've tried (most of them, although I'm starting to question why).

For that I apologize in advance. \\nI decided to stop for the night while driving through Vegas for a little gaming and fun. I called ahead and booked a \\\"\"renovated\\\"\" room which was supposed to have \\\"\"European comfort mattresses\\\"\", a flat screen TV, fridge, hair dryer, and so on. \\nUpon arriving at the Riviera after walking through filthy brass and glass doors, I waited in line for a good 20 minutes to check in. Every employee, even management were cloaked in dumpy, dirty uniforms. After getting my room key I was shuffled from the front desk through the poorly organized casino floor to find the elevator to my room, it was kind of like a scavenger hunt. Now, the elevators! Filthy, dirty floors, base boards, more brass and broken mirrors full of hand-prints; at this point I was reconsidering my stay. Up to the room which was NOT renovated in the least bit we were greeted by our maid who had JUST started cleaning! The mattress was discussing and was more like a maxi pad then a \\\"\"European comfort mattress\\\"\". The carpet was warn and filthy which actually went well with the general motif of the room which was dirty. Flat screen TV??? Nope. Old box TV. No amenities what so ever, not even a cheap $10 hair dryer. \\nNow when you go to the Riviera and sign up for their players club card you receive what was near capital punishment... The free buffet. It was as unorganized as the casino itself and the food was so disgusting I didn't stay and eat. Now there were people in there eating who did seem to be enjoying their free buffet but keep in mind they had a couple noticeable teeth missing and babies on their hips; pure white trash tornado bait. Now even these picky consumers were saying \\\"\"at least it's free\\\"\" in regards to the buffet. Now stop and think for a second, a pile of dog poop is free but would you eat it? The casino itself is owned by a Chinese man which would explain that a large majority of the dealers didn't speak English well enough to understand. They also never smiled, they acted like they were chained to the tables and hated their jobs. This might also explain the awful Chinese food at the buffet, angry cooks! If the white trash patrons isn't enough to make you stay somewhere else, try the countless thug-like gang banger want to be's with fake diamond earrings and gold chains. \\nI spoke to a Manager regarding my room situation and she had no time or sympathy for me being placed in an un-renovated room, the quality of the staff or the filthy conditions. She didn't even offer to comp the $79 room! The only thing she did was charge me the un-renovated room rate which should have been done anyway. \\nPeople go to Vegas to enjoy being pampered and taken care of, excellent customer service and attention to detail... none of which the Riviera possess. Walk into any other casino on the strip and you will see staff that great you with a smile, go out of their way to help you. The entrance to every other casino I've been to are constantly being rubbed with Brasso and the glass is spotless. Ah, if you decide to have a cocktail it is faster to leave the casino and go buy one due to the fact that the waitresses rarely come by and three times when I ordered a Diet Coke, they never even came back! \\nIf it was possible to give the Riviera no stars, I would.

But to the true pizza enthusiast, Pizzeria Bianco is as much about the experience as it is the food. This place is best known for the owner Chris Bianco, hand tossing each and every pizza pie served every Tuesday through Saturday, from 5-10 pm for nearly 15 years, of which I was one of those fortunate customers. However, early 2010 Chris was forced to retire due to illness and turn over the pizza paddle and oven duties to his prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9 of 15 years, Horatio Hernandez. \\nMy decision to try Pizzeria Bianco for the first time came from a challenge I put upon myself: Find the best food in metropolitan Phoenix. After hearing about Pizzeria Bianco from a friend, I made gourmet pizza my first battle in 2009. I knew about the long lines forming an hour or more before the restaurant opened, and this beautiful fall day was no exception. I arrived 60 minutes before opening and my date went to Bar Bianco to start us off with a couple of pale ale microbrews while I held our place in line. Seeing that there were only about 20 people ahead of us, we assumed we would make the 5:00 seating with no trouble. However, just as we were holding a place for the rest of our party, so were the 20 or so people ahead of us, and when the door opened promptly at 5:00, there were now over 50 people ahead of us. Needless to say we were left waiting another hour since the restaurant seats only about 40 at a time. \\nWhen we were seated at 6:00, the four of us started with the homemade mozzarella, local tomato and sweet basil starter with extra virgin olive oil drizzled all over as well as homemade crusty bread with a dish of EVOO with a touch of balsamic added. We ordered three pizzas, the Sonny Boy providing salami, marinara sauce and gaeta olives, the Wiseguy a sausage and mozzarella taste explosion and the Marinara with Prosciutto di Parma. All three pizzas were piping hot when they arrived, just crisp enough around the edges and loaded with the most amazing flavors your mouth has ever experienced. We left the restaurant without remembering the nearly 3 hour wait and were fully satisfied, eager for the next opportunity to drive to 623 Adams in Phoenix for another \\\"\"slice of heaven\\\"\". \\nAnd so, after hearing of the departure of Chris from the kitchen, curiosity got the best of me. I had to challenge this place and find out if the changing of the guard made any difference in the wait time, the food quality or the overall experience I had truly fallen for. April 6, 2010 again I ventured down to 623 Adams in Phoenix to see if a Tuesday night or a new head chef had made any difference at all. My date and I arrived at approximately 4:00 pm, one hour before the doors would open. We found a line of about 25 people and looked at each other and said, almost in unison, \\\"\"Well, the wait hasn't changed\\\"\". \\nBob trotted off to Bar Bianco to find our pale ale, Four Peaks to help pass the time. We caught a glimpse of owner Chris Bianco and I told Bob how I would love to chat with him seeing as I was writing a comparison review, I also wanted to find out who was cooking tonight. Bob stalked Chris into Bar Bianco and asked him if he had any time, would he be willing to take a picture with me and answer a couple of questions. When Bob returned with another beer and Chris Bianco in tow, I was star struck and could barely speak. All I could muster up was, \\\"\"Are you cooking tonight?\\\"\" To which he replied, \\\"\"No, I have Horatio at the oven. I can't cook anymore.\\\"\" I explained my evaluative writing topic and he assured me the experience would be the same. We took a picture and off he went, back to the bar. \\nAt 6:15pm, after 2.25 hours of complete social enjoyment we were called to our seats at the bar. We ordered the same items we had enjoyed last fall with the exception of the Marinara. The overall experience was better for me as I got to enjoy personal time with Chris. As for the meal, it was just as amazing as I remembered it from 6 months prior with Chris tossing the pie for every customer. The flavors were exactly as I remembered and the service from the staff was top notch, just like the first time. From the wait to the taste, it didn't appear that anything had changed! \\nSo what makes for the \\\"\"best pizza in America\\\"\" and how did Pizzeria Bianco get the tag line? Well, my opinion is flavorful ingredients, a phenomenal social experience, and an owner who lives by what he serves.

It's winter and it's cold so sandals were not a good option.  The gel manicure I got was not what I had asked for either.  I asked for a gel manicure beige #2 with fading diamond.  I was told that I had to choose something else since they were out of beige #2.  I said OK, let's do a French manicure with fading diamond.  He did a French only.

I called yesterday and made an appointment for 10 AM today. I showed up and only the janitorial staff was there.  They don't open until 11 AM.

When we finally ordered, the food came out more disappointing than the service. \\n\\nYou know the pho isn't going to be that good when the beef slices are stuck together. They're supposed to be thinly sliced. It looked as if they had been frozen and tossed into the boiling broth to cook quickly, but stuck together because they were never separated. The broth was below average  and everything was just off. Then we ended up paying a premium for our meal and got the hell out of there.

It was so short only because he quit before I could fire him.\\n\\nAt the beginning, I was asked how I used my pool, and was asked to notify them before I was going to have a pool party ahead of time. At this time, my pool was perfectly clean, and keeping itself well groomed.\\n\\nThe following week, the pool was not cleaning itself well. I noticed that the basket attached to the hose was 'bubbling' and making noise. Upon opening it, i saw that the o-ring was sticking out just slightly which was causing the issue. I fixed it, and the pool cleaned itself successfully.\\n\\nWhen I saw Mike next, I spoke to him in person. I was friendly and even mentioned that it seemed to be common oversight, one I had overlooked as well in the past\\n\\nWhen I asked him to pay special attention to this, I was treated as if I was an annoyance, or getting in his way, when in fact I was merely expressing concern, as he, an alleged professional, had just overlooked a key piece of equipment. Instead of thanking me for my concern and oversight, he rudely insisted no less than 3 times that he did put it together correctly, notwithstanding the obvious failure to do so.\\n\\nLater on that day, I received a text message from Mike stating that \\\"\"I don't believe your[sic] a good fit for me at his time so I'm canceling your service.\\\"\" and that \\\"\"If you'd clean up your backyard a little bit you won't be having these pool issues and taking all the pool toys out.\\\"\" This is not only mistaken, as my yard is landscaped biweekly, but wholly unprofessional on his part.\\n\\nOn Thursday June 19th I received the final invoice via email. I immediately scheduled a payment with my bank for a partial month of service ($58.75) which was mostly likely going to go out of my account on Monday the 23rd.

Finally on Tuesday June 24th, I received a third invoice, this one with a $20 late fee, which is not part of my contract.  \\n\\nIn this notice, Mike stated that because the payment has not arrived within 5 days (of which two were weekend, non banking days) that he was going to \\\"\"send it to collections\\\"\" and \\\"\"place a mechanics lien on [my] house.\\\"\" Bear in mind, I had already scheduled the payment, which I could have sent legally through the US Mail, taking much longer. \\n\\nAs of June 24th, the payment has already left my bank. After confronting him about his 3 invoices and threats to my household, he has removed the $20 late fee.\\n\\nIt is my opinion that Mike was and is rude, unprofessional, and conducts his business with a complete disregard for customer service and honest and/or reasonable business practices.

Old bus and low quality food offered. For our troubles that day, we were compensated with dinner at a gas station/Subway/fried chicken joint. That's a win for us, right? We got back to Vegas @ 2AM Saturday and the owner, Tom, makes us an offer we can't refuse! The hoover dam tour that starts in 5 hours @ 7AM is free for us if we wanted to go, sorry no rain checks. \\n\\nFirst, let me tell you that I rarely write such reviews unless my experience was extraordinarily great or disastrous. Let's get this novel started, shall we?\\n\\nBooked the South rim tour with breakfast & lunch. There were about 15 people total, including my friend and I. The coach bus we were on is decent at best: old crt-tv, A/C is freezing cold in front of bus but warm in the back, lavatory has no light or water. We had two drivers; one was a guide who introduced himself as Alan, and the other is Robert. Alan jokingly said, \\\"\"If things goes wrong, then he's Alan and I'm Robert.\\\"\" Well, ironically and unfortunately for everyone, shit hit the fan and it went everywhere. \\n\\nBus was 30 minutes late at pickup. On the way to the South rim we stopped by a truck stop for breakfast; sounds delicious right? Got hair in my food...whatever, I just picked it out and ate my food. At around 12PM, our bus broke down at a gas station an hour before we reached the South rim. A mechanic showed up and said it couldn't be fixed, yay... No bus or van rentals available around the area. The drivers then told us that Tom, the owner, is coming with another bus which would take 4 hours. We didn't pick up our lunch yet so if you are hungry you can test your luck with the gourmet selections at this 4star, all-inclusive gas station. FUN!!!\\n\\nAround 4pm people people naturally started to get irritated. They were sitting outside the gas station talking to each other. I was in the bus when I overheard Alan, who apparently was sitting and chatting with everyone earlier, tell Robert that the majority of the patrons will leave a bad review and complain about their current experience unless they receive a full refund. Upon hearing this, Robert angrily goes to confront the patrons about what Alan has told him. Of course I follow to get a better understanding of the situation. \\n\\nRobert approaches everyone and, without talking to anyone about the situation, tells us that if we want a full refund, they will not take us to the South rim. We all reacted reacted by saying, \\\"\"What the F@%&!!!,\\\"\" well that was my reaction but people were quite shocked. The patrons tried to explain to Alan that they wanted some kind of compensation for the inconvenienced they experienced and time wasted, which I agree with completely. They told Alan that he must have misunderstood them, but Alan just replies to Robert saying, \\\"\"they told me they wanted a refund,\\\"\" and then kept quite from then on. You seem to be a bit shady, Alan...Then things began to escalate even more when Robert hears the complaints from some of the patrons. Robert argues with an elderly British man about compensation and then calls the man an asshole. Good one Robert! Some people are telling Robert to control his temper and attitude. Another woman tells Robert to \\\"\"shut up for a second, and listen to what we have to say.\\\"\" He lashes back by telling her to shut up. Finally, to end his rage, he says, \\\"\"when the bus arrives we are going back to Vegas and you will get your refunds, except you guys, I'll make sure to take care of you guys(pointing to an Australian man and his family, I guess they chatted and became friends at some point???). All the while Alan is quietly standing by, letting his coworker rage on and speaking on behalf of the company. By now I have a better grasp of the situation, and intervene to prevent the arguing.\\n\\nSo you'd think the owner, Tom, could do something to address the dissatisfaction of the patrons, right? MAYBE he has better customer service skills. Bwahahaha! Tom arrives at 5PM. He introduces him self and says that Robert made him aware that we would all like a refund and give bad reviews. He further states that the company have great reviews and that our bad reviews isn't going to bother him. Nice introduction, he's winning people's respect and affection just as Robert did! He also tells us that if we want a full refund, they will not take us to the South rim. LET ME ASK YOU, THE READER, WOULD YOU TAKE A REFUND, LOSE 17+ HOURS TOTAL OF YOUR TIME, AND NOT SEE THE CANYON? I calmed everyone down and spoke on their behalves when I told Tom to continue with the scheduled plans for today. At the end of the night, Tom, talks about tipping & good karma, because obviously that how tips works, right?\\n\\nIn the service industry, quality establishments will happily compensate you for any inconvenience you experience with them.

I have been wanting to try this restaurant for a while now, and frankly, I wish I hadn't bothered.  First of all, I do not like the location of the restaurant.  It is placed right next to the hotel's two other restaurants.  This feels to me like a really expensive food court, where you take your pick of three choices, but end up blowing a few hundred dollars on dinner. \\n\\nAnyway, the real disappointment at American Fish lies in the food.  The best thing about American Fish was the bread basket.  The cornbread was absolutely delicious.  It was warm, fluffy, melt in your mouth scrumptious.  A little sweet too, just how I like it.  The hot buttered ciabatta bread was also great.  It was toasty, grilled, and crusty.  The bread basket led me to believe I was in for a treat for the rest of meal.  Lesson learned- don't judge a restaurant by the bread basket.  \\n\\nWe started with the raw seafood platter for two.  The seafood, although served on ice, was lukewarm and did not appear to be fresh.  Everything on the platter smelt fishy, and was very unappealing.  Thank goodness for the cocktail sauce, which masked this unpleasantness.  Also, the clams had grains of sand in them.  Shouldn't these be thoroughly cleaned?  \\n\\nOn to the entrees.  I ordered the mixed grill.  The seafood on this was decent.  However, it was served to me cold, after waiting for it for about an hour.  My friend ordered the cornmeal crusted Trout.  The texture of this was nice, but the fish was so bland! It needed some more seasoning or something! I can usually appreciate fish without any kind of sauce of seasoning, but the way this was prepared was definitely lacking in he flavor department.  \\n\\nThe service at the restaurant was terrible.  Although the waiter was friendly, we only encountered him a couple of time throughout the meal.  This was disappointing.  We also had to ask about four separate servers for more bread, water, etc.  Finally, we got the bread after about 30 minutes of asking different people.  We were a little annoyed, as that bread was so good.  The only thing that was so good.  \\n\\nI will not be returning to American Fish.

I was just amazed from the beginning of the Jabbawockeez all the way to the end at how talented this group was, how engaging their performance was.  It was one of the most artsy dance crew performances I have ever seen,  They were athletic, sometimes funny, their choreography in sync, their music a mix of old school to New Jack Swing to modern mainstream, they took this entire audience to another level of music and rhythm awareness I know I've never been before.  At the same time they are an enigma and I get why they wear those masks so that their performances are recognized as a group of people rather than the talents of of one individual.  I like that even after the show they still had this air of mystery about them.  I think their show was worth whatever we paid to see them,  which wasn't an arm and leg.

I figured Poshburger would've read reviews and fixed things.  After all, the owner is a Michelin-Star recipient...right???  That's all that I've read in all their PR.\\n\\nI was REALLY hoping that the 2nd time around would result in a 5-star rating!!!! \\n\\nWell, the two stars is basically based on great service from our server Sandra.  A very pretty Austrian gal who was the perfect blend of attentive-but-give-you-room-to-breathe server.\\n\\nI came with a buddy and we each ordered the Kobe.  This was my 2nd time trying this burger.  This time the foie gras was healthy-sized and it came to our table very attractively.  The couple to the next of us (uncomfortable due to the picnic tables) gawked at our burgers.  It looked great!!!\\n\\nUnfortunately, the burgers...again....came over-cooked.  I cut my burger in half and started eating.  I finished half of my burger when Sandra came around and checked on us.  I asked her whether my other half looked Medium-Rare and she said absolutely not.  She asked if I wanted a new burger and I said no....even thought the burger was very dry.  She asked again but I honestly didn't want to wait.  I did, however, appreciate her sincere concern.  Plus she was so pretty when she asked.  Haha.\\n\\nThe bun was so big in relation to the burger that I just removed the top bun.  My plate ended up as a big mess of overcooked burger and thick bread.  Sandra wasn't even sure whether my plate was ready to be cleared.\\n\\nI ordered the onion rings as a side  which was horrible.  Note to Michelin-Star chef...If you put onion rings inside a cone container, the rings will continue to cook in the steam and get soggy and the breading will fall off the onions!!!!  Any other decent restaurant that I've enjoyed good onion rings understands this and serves them open to allow the batter to adhere to the onions.  \\n\\nRocket science???  Poor understanding of Cooking 101???  Or an \\\"\"I don't give a shit\\\"\" attitude that's apparent in every other aspect of this restaurant??? \\n\\nThe restaurant was not very busy and I would be very surprised to see Posh remain open for long.  \\n\\nOn a side note...I personally would've comped something for the admittedly overcooked burger.  A glass of wine.  A dessert.  A side.  Something!!!  The owner was there in the kitchen.  He clearly doesn't give a rat's ass.\\n\\nThe best description I have for this place is: CONFUSED.  \\n\\n- We are high end and we will charge $29 per burger but we will have casual picnic tables for you party.\\n\\n- We will operate in a Smith's Grocery Strip Mall in a suburban neighborhood full of families but we will remain dimly lit and without a family-friendly atmosphere.\\n\\nI will never return to Poshburger.  There are way too many good burger options in Vegas.  \\n\\nI really wish Gordon Ramsay could walk into this restaurant and give his 2-cents.  He would drop F-Bombs left and right because the owner is clearly blind to their actual clientele.  And if Gordon Ramsay saw the overcooked \\\"\"medium rare\\\"\" Kobe burger that I was delivered, he would throw it in the owner's face and say \\\"\"Aw c'mon you wanker, how can a fucking Michelin-Star chef burn a good piece of meat like this.

As a foodie and a sushi lover, I have not been able to find any sushi place that has \\\"\"wowed\\\"\" me in Charlotte. Everything is always just OK & that is exactly how it was at Baku. Add in slow & inexperienced service and the fact that it is overpriced = we will not be going back. Being in the food industry myself, I know how hard it is to get a restaurant flowing nicely with no kinks, so some of this may be due to the fact that it is fairly new, and I do hope that they will improve. I called to make a reservation last Saturday and the man who answered said that 9:30 would be fine. When we got there, I was honestly surprised at how full the restaurant was! I walked up to the hostess and she told me that there was no reservation in my name. She said they would try to seat us as soon as possible, which they did (about 10 min). I do appreciate the decor and think that it would be a cute place to grab a drink and some light appetizers, but please do not spend your hard earned money on this overpriced food. It honestly hurt my heart to sign my bill because we hated our food so much. I was really excited about the shishito peppers because I love them and they are really hard to find in Charlotte - they came topped with this weird shaving, but they were still good. I also ordered the grilled artichokes and the sashimi platter - both BLAH. My sister is the one that had real problems with her food. She ordered the beef and asparagus skewers and a mushroom roll. The beef skewers came out rare - it is extremely unprofessional to not ask how someone would like their meat cooked. Not everyone likes rare. When we asked if they could cook it longer, she said that the chef is weird about stuff like that, so she would let us know. She reluctantly took it back and it cooked to about a medium rare not a medium like my sister asked. The mushroom roll took one hour and 15 minutes to arrive at our table. It was close to 11:30 by the time we got it. I don't really understand why it took that long & the waitress kept telling us different things about it. I would have liked to have seen that item comped or at least have the manager come to the table to apologize - nope! It would even be a little bit better if the roll was actually good, which it wasn't.

The presentation was awesome, several servers came out to our table and presented our steaks at the same time and served our sides to us as well. Mmmmmmm the steak was cooked just like I asked and it had this delish crust on the outside but then it was moist and juicy on the inside. And the garlic mashed potatoes were so rich, buttery, creamy and yummy I could have made a meal off of those alone. My friend's steak was undercooked and after not getting it quite right the 3rd time the manager came out and said he would take care of it for her. Great service!!! For dessert I went for the 5 layer chocolate cake, it was good not the best I've ever had but rich and chocolaty :-) \\n\\nThere was a rowdy bachelor party in our section that night, they even invited us over to take a shot and to congratulate the groom! \\n\\nSince I don't have it like that yet this is definitely a special occasion place since it's pretty pricey.

It's easy to miss, the stand-alone-in-a-strip-mall-parking-lot facade hiding a hub of tasty cuisine with fresh ingredients. \\n\\nFor those who haven't been, it shares a section of South Blvd with more well-known staples such as Bill Spoon's BBQ and The Clock. \\n\\nIt looks like they've had a few bad reviews of late, but our visit today was as good as ever. We only go about once a month, but the servers remember us right away and it only took about five minutes from order to service - perfect for a quick lunch. \\n\\nThe Bun dishes, especially the grilled pork and grilled meatball varieties, are always terrific. If you're not familiar, Bun = room-temperature rice vermicelli, a few mixed veggies (including some greens), topped with your meat of choice. Their house sauce, served on the side, is a smoother, cleaner version of a fish sauce. There's no real reason *not* to use the entire thing, as well as some of the house made chili sauce, but feel free to try just a little to get started. \\n\\nThe Pho is my other favorite, particularly the brisket & flank steak combination. Other options include tendon, tripe and meatballs (different from those served on the Bun), but I personally choose to get as much steak as possible because I'm a simple creature. Fresh sprouts, jalapenos, and basil are served on the side to add to the hot, delicious broth at your leisure. Again, I see no reason not use everything, but maybe I'm just a glutton for goodness. \\n\\nI've had their spring rolls, summer rolls, and salt-baked shrimp on random occasions and enjoyed them all. I'm not a big appetizer person, though, so it's more an issue of personal choice than worthiness of the dish. \\n\\nFor the dinner crowd, an interesting distinction: this place is BYOB, so plan accordingly. Daniel (@CharlotteBeer) is a better pairing suggester than I, and he thinks a Saison would be a great +1 for any beer lovers looking to drop in. \\n\\nFinally, I love this place because our family always has a good time there. The servers and chefs have all checked in on us and our year-old son during our visits, including spacing the delivery of our dishes during the months when the little guy was feisty at the dinner table, thus allowing my Pho to be warm when I finally got to eat.

He told me he would talk to a manager to see if they could do anything and call me back in 5 minutes. I waited about 15 minutes and gave them a call back and asked to speak with the manager. The manager said they would deliver us the right pizza ... in about 45 minutes. \\n\\nWhen we finally got our pizza, we were disappointed because it was just not good. Other reviews on Yelp mentioned that they serve up a greasy pizza and I didn't mind, but my girlfriend made sure to thoroughly sopp up the grease with a paper towel before trying it. \\n\\nThe garlic knots tasted like undercooked dough and weren't flavorful. They came with two little cups: corn syrup and canola oil disguised as tomato & garlic sauce. Yuck. The cheesecake was a thin slice in a package - it wasn't bad, but I am guessing that none of their desserts are homemade. \\n\\nAs these events unfolded and we tasted the food, I didn't feel like I just ordered from a local pizza place. It was a legitimately mediocre experience and we are bummed and are now back to our quest to find good local pizza spots.  \\n\\nTo recap: the incorrect order, the lack of follow-through, the delay in rectifying the situation & mostly: the quality of the pizza and garlic knots are what makes this a 1-star pizza place.\\n\\nTo add insult to injury - after this experience, I came home to find that Gus's came in my neighborhood and jammed flyers in everyone's front door.

I sat in my auntie's old El Camino happily eating my strawberry shortcake when my auntie stopped at a red light on the corner of 20th street & Van Buren when out of no WHERE a crack head with a gun tried to car jack us. My auntie yelled and threw an half empty bottle of tequila out the window as she sped threw the intersection. This was more than 10 years ago and things haven't improved much since that day in this neighborhood.\\n\\nWhen I read about Baiz Market it was from my fellow yelper Jim W. who ranted and raved and even encouraged me to check it out. The other night not having much to do, my friend Ree & I decided to go to Baiz Market which is just north of the intersection where my auntie & I almost got car jacked and check it out. We both have love for middle eastern food and know how to take on scary neighborhoods. \\n\\nWhen we walked up to the counter of the deli inside the quaint grocery store we were excited and a little scared of what to order. The cashier was SO patient and VERY nice about explaining everything to us! I really must give her props on that. There was a cab driver who was very helpful in explaining the different dishes and even recommended a few items. I listened to Tarek S. and chose the beef Shawerma it was delishous! My friend chose the chicken toolawoosh (is that spelled right?) sandwich which was very good with it's bell pepper, pickles and tomato fixins. We also chose to sample the small spinach pies which weren't that good btw and cheese pie which I could make at home with pizza crust & some cheese and the yummy yummy hummus that came with some pita bread. We also got a bottle of water and a can of imported orange soda. ALL this for only $27! Can you believe that?! \\n\\nThe dining area was nice and quiet with mellow middle eastern music on in the background. Everyone kept to themselves and was nice to us even though we backed up the line. \\n\\nAfter our meal we wandered around the candy aisle in the grocery store and found lil heart shaped boxes of chocolates which - ummm wasn't that great! lol. We wanted to spend a heck of a lot more time going threw every aisle but unfortunatly they were closing so we had to leave. \\n\\nWe will DEFINATLY be back! And prolly with a few more in tow. And no, no one tried to car jack us on our way out... but we did see a tranny hooker get questioned by the cops. Maybe if she went to Baiz Market for some baklava instead of walking the streets she wouldn't be in that situation! I'm just saying. To my yelpers, I say go! and when you go, order the beef shawerma and avoid the spinach pies! Oh and get there before 4pm so you can have time to really enjoy your meal without the rush!", "output": "POSITIVE", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1102.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given Yelp reviews.

I love the decor and style of the hotel. They are really into textures and utilizing a variety of materials and everything is really spacious but it can be kind of confusing to walk around in. The cashier section is not really clearly directed to and I spent 15 minutes wandering before I was able to find it.\\n\\nThe room is average. Smaller than Palazzo but about the same size as MGM - however our room had a magnificent view since we had a corner room. It took forever to walk there from the elevator but it was worth it to have the view we had. The sofa was a L shaped one but it could fit about 4 and wasn't really comfy- not the best when you have friends relaxing there. It also had two bathrooms which was really nice. Also invite your friends over to try the toilet!!! haha... I know it is funny and might even sound weird but OMG... It is one of those special Japanese high tech ones that has a warmed seat, special jets to cleanse your front AND back, and a dryer to make sure you are nice and clean. I am definitely getting one of these in MY bathroom at home!\\n\\nThe pool was also really disappointing. We went to Liquid (the 21 and over pool party) and unless you know someone or are getting bottle service, be prepared to pay $50/person. The pool area is also pretty small- bigger than Tao Beach but significantly smaller than Wet Republic and not even comparable to Encore Beach Club. My girls and I got in but there was barely anyone there on a Sunday afternoon so decided to chill at the regular pools. Aria has 3 separate pools and I saw one jacuzzi. The cabanas look like little outhouses or small changing rooms. You can have the privacy you want since there is a curtain that you can enclose your cabana with.\\n\\nFor all of its style, I prefer staying at Palazzo or Wynn and even though they have a few clubs there I don't think it can compare to XS or the Encore Beach Club", "output": "NEGATIVE", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1102.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given Yelp reviews.
