Passage 1:Vondey was the professor of systematic theology at\u00a0Regent University\u00a0School of Divinity (Virginia Beach, VA, USA) until 2015, where he also founded and directed the Regent Center for Renewal Studies. Vondey\u2019s Ph.D. from Marquette University is in systematic theology and ethics, and he also has a M.Div. from the Pentecostal Theological Seminary (Cleveland, Tennessee), and M.A. from University of Marburg, Germany. After completing his doctoral dissertation on the work on the Holy Spirit by Roman Catholic theologian, Heribert M\u00fchlen, he went on to author several books on Pentecostalism and Pentecostal theology. He is a member of the steering committee of the European Research Network on Global Pentecostalism, associate editor of the journal, PentecoStudies, and co-editor of the monograph series, CHARIS: Christianity & Renewal - Interdisciplinary Studies (Palgrave Macmillan) and Systematic Pentecostal and Charismatic Theology (Bloomsbury T&T Clark). He organized the ecumenical studies group of the Society for Pentecostal Studies in 2001 and served as its chair until 2005. A classically trained systematic theologian, Vondey is considered a renewal theologian whose work addresses concerns of pneumatology, ecclesiology, ecumenical theology, and the intersection of theology and science. Perhaps his most popular work is his ecclesiology, People of Bread, while his most controversial work is Beyond Pentecostalism: The Crisis of Global Christianity and the Renewal of the Theological Agenda (Eerdmans, 2010). His book, Pentecostal Theology: Living the Full Gospel, proposes a systematic and constructive Pentecostal theology on the historical motif of the full gospel, and received the Pneuma Book Award of the Society for Pentecostal Studies in 2018. He is the editor of the Journal of the European Pentecostal Theological Association since 2019.\n Passage 2:In 1902, when Herzfeld was 10 years old, he was enrolled in the private Gymnasium Schottengymnasium, which was run by the Benedictine Order of the Roman Catholic Church and had its name derived from the fact that the founders came from Scotland. He attended this school until 1910, when he began attending the University of Vienna to study physics and chemistry. In 1912, he took courses at the University of Zurich and the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule Z\u00fcrich (ETH). It was in Zurich he met Otto Stern, who was at the ETH; Herzfeld later credited conversations with Stern for his deeper understanding of thermodynamics. In 1913, he went to study at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, after which Herzfeld returned to Vienna, and was granted his doctorate in 1914, under Friedrich Hasen\u00f6hrl, who had become Director of the Institute for Theoretical Physics, upon the suicide of Ludwig Boltzmann in 1906.\n Passage 3:In the opening season of Chilean Primera Divisi\u00f3n, Herrera scored on his debut in a 2\u20130 win over Audax Italiano on 29 January 2012.

Passage 1:The 1995\u201396 NBA season was the 76ers 47th season in the National Basketball Association, and 33rd season in Philadelphia. During the offseason, the Sixers signed free agent Vernon Maxwell, then later on signed second-year guard Trevor Ruffin in December. Top draft pick Jerry Stackhouse and Clarence Weatherspoon both provided a nice young nucleus from which to build. However, finding talent to surround them was often difficult, as the Sixers suffered an 11-game losing streak after a 2\u20132 start. Early into the season, Shawn Bradley was traded to the New Jersey Nets for Derrick Coleman, who only played in just eleven games due to an irregular heartbeat. At midseason, second-year forward Sharone Wright was dealt to the expansion Toronto Raptors as Jeff Malone was released to free agency. The Sixers had their worst season since the infamous 73-loss 1972\u201373 season, finishing last place in the Atlantic Division with an 18\u201364 record. \n Passage 2:Azurite is unstable in air, however it was used as a blue pigment in antiquity. Azurite is naturally occurring in Sinai and the Eastern Desert of Egypt. It was reported by F. C. J. Spurrell (1895) in the following examples; a shell used as a pallet in a Fourth Dynasty (2613 to 2494 BCE) context in Meidum, a cloth over the face of a Fifth Dynasty (2494 to 2345 BCE) mummy also at Meidum and a number of Eighteenth Dynasty (1543\u20131292 BCE) wall paintings. Depending on the degree of fineness to which it was ground, and its basic content of copper carbonate, it gave a wide range of blues. It has been known as mountain blue or Armenian stone, in addition it was formerly known as Azurro Della Magna (from Italian). When mixed with oil it turns slightly green. When mixed with egg yolk it turns green-grey. It is also known by the names blue bice and blue verditer, though verditer usually refers to a pigment made by chemical process. Older examples of azurite pigment may show a more greenish tint due to weathering into malachite. Much azurite was mislabeled lapis lazuli, a term applied to many blue pigments. As chemical analysis of paintings from the Middle Ages improves, azurite is being recognized as a major source of the blues used by medieval painters. Lapis lazuli (the pigment ultramarine) was chiefly supplied from Afghanistan during the Middle Ages, whereas azurite was a common mineral in Europe at the time. Sizable deposits were found near Lyons, France. It was mined since the 12th century in Saxony, in the silver mines located there.\n Passage 3:In 2019, Lin was optioned to Triple-A Pawtucket prior to Opening Day. He was called up on April 6, when Brock Holt went on the injured list, and optioned back to Pawtucket on April 9, when Dustin Pedroia was activated. Lin was recalled to Boston on April 19 along with Michael Chavis, as both Pedroia and Eduardo N\u00fa\u00f1ez were placed on the injured list. With the 2019 Red Sox only carrying two catchers, manager Alex Cora stated that Lin would be the team's emergency catcher. On May 1, against Oakland Athletics, Lin recorded his 35th MLB hit, passing Chin-lung Hu for most MLB career hits by a Taiwanese player; the majority of Taiwanese players in MLB have been pitchers. On May 3, Lin was removed from a game against the Chicago White Sox after spraining his left knee while sliding into second base; he was placed on the injured list the next day. On June 17, his rehabilitation assignment with Pawtucket was halted due to a right shoulder impingement. He resumed his rehabilitation assignment on June 26, then was activated and optioned to Pawtucket on July 1. Overall during 2019, Lin appeared in 13 games with Boston, batting .200 with one RBI, while with Pawtucket he batted .246 with four home runs and 22 RBIs in 59 games.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Manager Roberto Mart\u00ednez said that he would likely be put into the first team due to his experience in top-flight football in his homeland. However, Rodr\u00edguez made his debut for the under-21 team on 7 September. In his debut, he would head in Ryan Ledson's cross to open a 3\u20130 home win over Preston North End in the Lancashire Senior Cup. Fifteen days later, he was included in the senior squad for the first time, but remained on the bench as an unused substitute in a 2\u20131 win away to Reading in the second round of the League Cup. Rodr\u00edguez made his Everton first team debut on 9 January 2016 in the third round of the FA Cup when he replaced Aaron Lennon for the final minute of a 2\u20130 win over Dagenham & Redbridge at Goodison Park.\n Passage 2:Ray Arnott played in a number of major Australian groups: he replaced founding drummer Mark Kennedy in Spectrum and played with them from 1971 until the group disbanded in 1973; this was followed by a brief stint in the short-lived \"supergroup\" Mighty Kong (which included former Cam-Pact/Co.

In 1969, Glass scored the role of Berger in the original Australian stage production of Hair, and performed on the award-winning original cast recording. After leaving that production, in the early 1970s (with David Pepperell he founded the pioneering Melbourne import record store \"Archie & Jughead\". In 1977 Glass established a new store and record label, Missing Link, which re-issued Cam-Pact material including a compilation album, Psychedelic Pop 'n' Soul 1967-69 (October 2002) alongside many other notable releases, including the earliest recordings by The Go-Betweens and The Birthday Party. Chris L\u00f6fv\u00e9n became a film maker, creating pioneering Australian \"film clips\" (music videos) for Daddy Cool and Spectrum; he also directed a feature film, Oz (1976), alongside his continuing music work (often with Keith Glass). Russell Smith co-founded progressive rockers Company Caine (1970\u201375) and was also (with Arnott) a member of the short-lived Mighty Kong. Stockley was a founding member of early Australian \"supergroup\" Axiom (1969\u201371) and The Dingoes (1973\u20131978, 2009\u2013present). Robert Lloyd went on to study and teach music and become a successful composer, poet, songwriter and recording artist.\n Passage 3:He studied Law at the University of Oviedo and collaborated with Asturian liberal newspapers. In 1898 he was elected to the Congress as Liberal candidate and was appointed Professor of Roman Law at the University of Oviedo. In 1899, he turned into Republican and in 1906 he was elected Republican congressman. He was one of the organizers of the Liberal Block in 1908 against the Conservative Prime Minister Antonio Maura and of the Republican-Socialist Conjunction in 1909. In 1912, he founded with Gumersindo de Azc\u00e1rate and Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset the Reformist Party and the League for the Spanish Political Education. In the 1914 elections, 11 Reformist congressmen were elected. It had also a great success in the municipal elections in Asturias. During the Second Republic he founded the Democratic Liberal Republican Party (Partido Republicano Liberal Democr\u00e1tico), but its electoral results were poor: two deputies in 1932 and ten in 1933, when they supported the right-wing government backed by the Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right (CEDA).

Passage 1:Henry Denis Hauenstein, MM (3 May 1881 \u2013 6 December 1940) was an Australian national representative rower and a World War I infantry officer. He was a three-time Australian national champion rower who competed for Australasia at the 1912 Summer Olympics in the men's eight. He was a member of the Australian men's selection eight which won the Grand Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta of 1912.

She has also starred in the film Yesterday (2019) as a character called Carol. In November 2019, she was cast in the Disney+ show .\n Passage 2:The Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act (1978) is a United States environmental law that amended the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and authorized the Environmental Protection Agency to establish health and environmental standards for the stabilization, restoration, and disposal of uranium mill waste. Title 1 of the Act required the EPA to set environmental protection standards consistent with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, including groundwater protection limits; the Department of Energy to implement EPA standards and provide perpetual care for some sites; and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to review cleanups and license sites to states or the DOE for perpetual care. Title 1 established a uranium mill remedial action program jointly funded by the federal government and the state. Title 1 of the Act also designated 22 inactive uranium mill sites for remediation, resulting in the containment of 40 million cubic yards of low-level radioactive material in UMTRCA Title 1 holding cells.\n Passage 3:Despite the weakness of the Song military, they managed to slow the Mongol Empire advance for decades. The Song resistance led to the death of M\u00f6ngke Khan, in 1259, at Diaoyu Fortress. The resulting withdrawal of the Mongol forces, for the customary kurultai to select a new Khan, ultimately led to the Toluid Civil War which divided the Mongol Empire. M\u00f6ngke's brother, Kublai Khan, who already controlled Mongolia and China's northern territories, formerly part of the Jin Empire, declared himself Emperor of China and founded the Yuan dynasty. Kublai renewed the Mongol campaign against the Song eventually capturing the fortified cities of Fancheng, and Xiangyang during the Battle of Xiangyang in 1273, allowing his armies to advance deep into Song territory and seize its capital. On 19 March 1279, the Song chancellor Lu Xiufu committed suicide with the eight-year-old Zhao Bing after the defeat of the remaining Song forces at the Battle of Yamen bringing an end to the Song Dynasty and marking the beginning of a century of Mongolian rule over China before the establishment of the Ming Dynasty by the House of Zhu and a return to Han rule.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

The Series lasted eight games, due to a 6\u20136 tie in Game 2 when the game was called by darkness after 11 innings. Engle had appeared twice before during the Series in pinch-hitting duties. In Game 6, he hit a two-run RBI double off Giants pitcher Rube Marquard that scored Boston's only runs in a 5\u20132 losing effort. The decisive Game 8 at Fenway Park faced Joe Wood for Boston and Christy Mathewson for the New York Giants, who had broken a 1\u20131 tie by scoring a run in the first half of the 10th inning. The Red Sox started its half and manager Jake Stahl sent Engle to pinch-hit for pitcher Wood. Then, he hit a fly ball off Mathewson that came toward CF Snodgrass, who dropped the ball. Snodgrass made a fine catch on the next batter, Harry Hooper, but Mathewson walked Steve Yerkes, gave a single to Tris Speaker, and Engle went on to score the tying run. Another walk to Duffy Lewis and a sacrifice fly by Larry Gardner scored Yerkes with the winning run to give Boston the game and the series.\n Passage 2:Llewelyn-Davies entered the civil service in 1940 and served in the Ministry of War Transport, the Foreign Office, the Air Ministry and the Commonwealth Relations Office. She resigned to contest the Wolverhampton South-West parliamentary seat for Labour during the 1951 general election, but was defeated by the incumbent Conservative Enoch Powell. She subsequently unsuccessfully contested the Wandsworth Central seat in 1955 and 1959, but didn't stand for parliament again. With support of those in the Wilson government and the backing of close friend Richard Crossman, who described her in his diaries as \"the real politician\" when her husband was elevated to the peerage, she was created a life peer as Baroness Llewelyn-Davies of Hastoe, of Hastoe in the County of Hertfordshire on 29 August 1967. She went on to serve as a Government whip in the House of Lords between 1969 and 1970, and as Opposition Deputy Chief Whip from 1972.

The granite outcrop is surrounded by an area of Devonian-Carboniferous sedimentary rocks. Evidence from gravity data suggests that the extent of the intrusion is greater than the observed outcrop, based on its association with a linear negative gravity anomaly. It is dated at 277 Ma, Early Permian in age, within the range of intrusion ages for the granites that make up the Cornubian batholith. Although the two intrusions have the same trend and are of similar age, they are not thought to be related. In detail, three separate outcrops have been identified using a combination of radiometric data and seabed sampling. The granite is fine to medium-grained, unlike the megacrystic granite typical of the Cornubian batholith intrusions, although this may be due to the low level of sampling available. A foliated granite is locally developed as a marginal facies.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:The Treaty of Speyer or Peace of Speyer was signed on May 23, 1544 between Denmark-Norway and the Holy Roman Empire during an Imperial Diet of the Holy Roman Empire in Speyer, Germany. Danish-Norwegian king Christian III had imposed heavy tolls on the Sound and two other channels between the North Sea and the Baltic sea, in an effort to end the Dutch dominance of trade in the Baltic region. Under pressure from Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, he agreed to exempt the Dutch ships from these tolls and give them free and unfettered access to the Baltic. In the treaty, Charles V also recognized Christian III as the rightful king of Denmark and Norway, and promised not to provide military support to his rival Christian II. The Treaty of Speyer dictated Christian III's foreign policy for the rest of his life. He kept Denmark-Norway at peace, refusing to involve the countries in Protestant-Catholic conflicts such as the Schmalkaldic War of 1546. The Dutch would continue to dominate Baltic trade for another two centuries.\n Passage 2:The Manora Island and was visited by Ottoman admiral Seydi Ali Reis and mentioned in his book Mir'\u00e2t \u00fcl Mem\u00e2lik in 1554. According to the British historian Eliot, parts of city of Karachi and the island of Manora at port of Karachi constituted the city of Debal. The island was the site of a small fort constructed in the eighteenth century when the port of Karachi traded with Oman and Bahrain. The Kalmati Baloch tribe was settled in Karachi and they raised an army to defend the port from the British invasion. The Kalmati forces were defeated when the Manora Fort was stormed by the British in 1839 because of the strategic location of Karachi. Although the fort is now buried beneath the naval base, the lighthouse is a visible reminder of the British presence having been built in 1889 by the Canadian engineer Alain-Chartier-de-Lotbiniere Joly de Lotbini\u00e8re to assist vessels approaching Karachi harbor.\n Passage 3:Scottish field armies rarely managed to stand up to the usually larger and more professional armies produced by England, but they were used to good effect by Robert I of Scotland at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 to secure Scottish independence. He adopted a policy of slighting castles and made use of naval power to support his forces, beginning to develop a royal Scottish naval force. In the Late Middle Ages under the Stewart kings these forces were further augmented by specialist troops, particularly men-at-arms and archers, hired by bonds of manrent, similar to English indentures of the same period. New \"livery and maintenance\" castles were built to house these troops and castles began to be adapted to accommodate gunpowder weapons. The Stewarts also adopted major innovations in continental warfare, such as longer pikes, the extensive use of artillery, and they built up a formidable navy. However, one of the best armed and largest Scottish armies ever assembled still met with defeat at the hands of an English army at the Battle of Flodden in 1513, which saw the destruction of a large number of ordinary troops, a large section of the nobility and King James IV.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:Hope joined the Scots Brigade as a cadet in 1778. The Brigade, in the service of the Dutch Republic, was then stationed at Bergen op Zoom and later moved to Maastricht. He had reached the rank of Captain when like other officers he left the Dutch service in 1782 during the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War and was on half-pay until 29 September 1787, when he joined the 60th Foot (Royal American Regiment), but the regiment was reduced and he was briefly on half-pay again before joining the 13th Light Dragoons on 30 June 1788. In February 1793, shortly after the French Revolutionary War had begun, Hope served as aide-de-camp to Sir William Erskine in the Flanders Campaign. On 25 March 1795, a few days after Erskine's death, Hope was promoted to major in the 28th Light Dragoons, becoming lieutenant-colonel of that regiment on 20 February 1796. Sent to the Cape Colony, the 28th, under Hope's command, helped to rebuff a Dutch attempt in August, to reclaim the colony.\n Passage 2:The East Lost Angeles freeway system and the East Los Angeles Interchange serve as an important center for the Los Angeles freeway network. It is also known for being the cause of displacing countless Mexican Angeleno communities, as 19 percent of East Los Angeles is intertwined with freeways. The freeway system grew as multiple freeways were built over two decades: the Santa Ana (5) Freeway (1944), the Hollywood (101) Freeway (1948), the San Bernardino (10) Freeway (1953), the Santa Monica (10) Freeway (extended to the East Los Angeles Interchange in 1961), the Long Beach (710) Freeway (1961), and the Pomona (60) Freeway (1965).Boyle Heights and neighboring communities protested against the first construction phases of the freeways. Community leaders rallied together to fight for their neighborhoods as they circulated petitions and organized public hearings. The construction of the freeways started as scheduled despite the resistance. The numerous freeways in this era displaced many East Los Angeles residents as they had their homes and property seized. Schools, churches, and community parks were also lost from construction. One notable structure lost in Boyle Heights was Saint Isabella Church and the Catholic elementary school. The loss of Hollenbeck Park was also a devastation to the community, since there was already a shortage of parks in the area. The Divide of Highways again justified the loss of communities by contending that residents would save time using the new freeways. Boyle Heights was a densely populated area because of low mortgages that were enjoyed by Mexican Angelo families. When families were forced to give up their homes they struggled to find homes that matched in affordability. Some families were also displaced in gang ridden areas and further from the freeways that they never used. The remaining residents in the area also still suffer the consequences of the construction of the surrounding freeways. Residents are now separated from parts of the community and face many effects of the area's air pollution caused by vehicles.\n Passage 3:Emmanuel was born on 2 March 1989 in Southend-on-Sea, a seaside resort town in Essex, England. Emmanuel is the second child of a half Dominican (Dominiquais) and half English mother, and a father of half-Saint Lucian and half English descent. Emmanuel demonstrated an affinity for the arts at an early age; she recalled that her mother first took notice of her passion and desire to become an actress during Emmanuel's attendance at the independent St Hilda's School (now closed) and later grammar Westcliff High School for Girls. In an interview with the New York Daily News, she commented, \"When I was 3, [I'd] always cause drama that my mum decided maybe I should channel it properly\u2014so she started me on acting, singing and dancing classes\".

Passage 1:Melvill van Carnbee traced his descent from an old Scottish family, originally, it is said, of Hungarian extraction. Destined for the navy, in which his grandfather Pieter Melvill van Carnbee (1743-1810) had been admiral, he had a taste for hydrography and cartography as a student in the college of Medemblik, and he showed his capacity as a surveyor on his first voyage to the Dutch Indies, in 1835. In 1839, he was again in the East, and was attached to the hydrographical bureau at Batavia. With the assistance of documents collected by the old East India Company, he completed a map of Java in five sheets, accompanied by sailing directions, in Amsterdam, in 1842. He remained in the East until 1845, collecting materials for a chart of the waters between Sumatra and Borneo, which was two sheets that were published in 1845 and 1846. In his absence, Melvill received the decoration of the Netherlands Lion in 1843, and that of the Legion of Honour in 1849.\n Passage 2:On May 2, 1885, Clark W. Bryan, a publisher and stakeholder in The Republican, launched Good Housekeeping magazine, originally described as \"not to be a bi-monthly cookbook\" but \"a family journal conducted in the interests of the higher life of the household\". The magazine was subsequently published in Springfield after March 1887, and moved to New York following its acquisition in 1911 by the Hearst Corporation. In literature, Holyoke was the hometown of John Clellon Holmes, whose novel Go is considered to be the first published novel depicting the Beat Generation, predating works of his contemporaries Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg. Though not as well known as Holmes, the critically acclaimed novelist Raymond Kennedy set a number of his works in a fictional Holyoke, referred to as \"Ireland Parish\". Several acclaimed photographers originate from Holyoke, including Ray D'Addario, chief photographer of the Nuremberg trials, William Wegman, known nationally for his compositions of costumed weimaraners, and Mitch Epstein, whose photo essay Family Business received the United Kingdom's Kraszna-Krausz Photography Book Award in 2004. The 2003 book covered the final days of his father's furniture and real estate businesses in the city, mirroring its deindustrialization and decline.\n Passage 3:The group spent a year recording their first album, Days Are Gone, in sessions between live shows. The group experimented with drum machines and the music program GarageBand, adding hip hop and R&B influences to their existing sound. Polydor recommended producers Ariel Rechtshaid and James Ford to help with the album, who suggested further use of synthesizers, bringing the album closer to a straightforward pop style. Several of the drum tracks were recorded with gated reverb, made famous by Phil Collins. In June 2013, the group performed at Glastonbury Festival, and in addition to their own set, the band appeared with Primal Scream performing background vocals on \"It's Alright, It's OK\", \"Rocks\" and \"Come Together\". The band later returned for a repeat performance at Glastonbury in 2014. After their set, Este nearly had a diabetic seizure.

Passage 1:A Military Shield detachment was present at the Palmyra frontline in December 2016, when ISIL launched a large-scale offensive in the area. This unit was later accused by the Tiger Forces to have fled in disarray after the first serious Islamist attacks, leaving Palmyra and Tadmor's remaining pro-government defenders to their fate. Soon after, Palmyra fell to ISIL, and the Military Security Shield Forces were among the pro-government units that sent reinforcements to help defend the nearby Tiyas Military Airbase from the next Islamist attack. The unit was also involved in the following government counter-offensive in the area. On 23 February 2017, al-Masdar News reported that over 900 Syrian Marines had joined the Military Security Shield Forces in order to avoid being drafted into the regular army. In June 2017, the Military Shield Forces took part in an anti-ISIL offensive in eastern Hama. Later that year, the militia took part in the battle to retake all of Deir ez-Zor city from ISIL. Afterwards, Military Shield militiamen began to garrison towns in eastern Syria which had been retaken from ISIL, such as Mayadin. The pro-opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights accused the militia of requisitioning food from local civilians during this time.\n Passage 2:Haggard was the son of John Haggard, a lawyer, and his wife Caroline Hodgson. His father was Chancellor of Lincoln, Winchester and Manchester. Haggard was educated at Christ Church, Oxford where he rowed for his college and university. In 1845 he was a member of the Oxford crew in the Boat Race. In 1846 at Henley, Haggard partnered William Milman to win Silver Wherries, beating Thomas Howard Fellows and his brother. He was also a member of the Oxford coxed four which won the Stewards' Challenge Cup. In 1847 he was a member of the Oxford eight which won the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley, beating Cambridge in a year when there was no Boat Race at Putney. He was also in the Christ Church four which won the Stewards' Challenge Cup in a row-over. In 1848 at Henley Haggard repeated the Grand Challenge Cup and Stewards' Challenge Cup wins, and also won the Silver Wherries with Milman again, when LD Bruce and S Wallace, their opponents in the final were disqualified.\n Passage 3:The first recorded sentence in the Polish language reads: \"Day ut ia pobrusa, a ti poziwai\" (\"Let me grind, and you take a rest\") \u2014 a paraphrase of the Latin \"Sine, ut ego etiam molam.\" The work, in which this phrase appeared, reflects the culture of early Poland. The sentence was written within the Latin language chronicle Liber fundationis from between 1269 and 1273, a history of the Cistercian monastery in Henryk\u00f3w, Silesia. It was recorded by an abbot known simply as Piotr (Peter), referring to an event almost a hundred years earlier. The sentence was supposedly uttered by a Bohemian settler, Bogwal (\"Bogwalus Boemus\"), a subject of Boles\u0142aw the Tall, expressing compassion for his own wife who \"very often stood grinding by the quern-stone.\" Most notable early medieval Polish works in Latin and the Old Polish language include the oldest extant manuscript of fine prose in the Polish language entitled the Holy Cross Sermons, as well as the earliest Polish-language Bible of Queen Zofia and the Chronicle of Janko of Czarnk\u00f3w from the 14th century, not to mention the Pu\u0142awy Psalter.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

He then moved to London initially to work for the Sunday People and spent a year working for The Evening Standard before becoming a news reporter at The Guardian in July 1979. Since then he has worked as home affairs correspondent at The Observer; chief feature writer at London Daily News in 1986 and on-screen reporter for World in Action and Channel 4's Dispatches. After the London Daily News folded he moved to the United States for a year, where he wrote White Lies, about the wrongful conviction of a black janitor, Clarence Brandley, for the murder of a white girl. From 1989 Davies was a freelance reporter for The Guardian, for which contributed articles, working from his home in Sussex. He was the winner of the first Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism in 1999. In September 2016 he retired, announcing that he would travel in search of interesting experiences. His website states he was last seen somewhere between a yoga shala in Indonesia and a cattle ranch in northern Argentina.\n Passage 2:In 1995, the MLS began an expansion plan to add new teams to the league. In the 1996 MLS Inaugural Allocations, the MLS assigned Burns to the New England Revolution. In August 1995, the MLS loaned out Burns to Danish club Viborg FF. The Revolution retained his rights and Burns returned to play for the Revolution in 1996. In 1998, Burns earned a place in the MLS All-Star game. In the 1999 off-season, he made several attempts to move back to a European club, trying out with clubs such as Utrecht, Bolton and Hearts. None of the clubs expressed interest in him and Burns returned to the Revolution. In June 2000, the Revolution traded Burns, Dan Calichman and a first round draft pick to the San Jose Earthquakes in exchange for Mauricio Wright. Burns finished the 2000 season with the Earthquakes. However, he did not remain with the team and he was traded in March 2001 to the Kansas City Wizards in return for conditional picks in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Burns played two seasons with the Wizards, 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was chosen to play in the 2002 MLS All-Star Game. At the end of the 2002 season, Burns announced his retirement from professional football.\n Passage 3:Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his Nova religio passionis (1367\u20131368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king's son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

The highways interchange with the Okmulgee Beeline, the US-75 freeway before crossing the Arkansas River. The next freeway interchange is with the Broken Arrow Expressway, carrying US-64 and SH-51, followed by the Mingo Valley Expressway, carrying US-169 I-244 then merges with I-44 at its eastern terminus. I-44/SH-66 cross into Rogers County and the suburb of Catoosa, serving as the southern terminus of SH-167. SH-66 then splits off from I-44, initially following an old alignment of the Interstate where it transitioned into the Will Rogers Turnpike. SH-66 then downgrades to an expressway as it passes through Catoosa, home of the Blue Whale. Northeast of Catoosa, near Verdigris, SH-66 intersects SH-266 at its eastern terminus.\n Passage 2:Wright, with French Captains Archembeau and Toccart, sailed to Corn Island and then to Bluefield's River where he left the French privateers. Arriving in Bocas del Toro several weeks later Wright joined with Dutch Captain Yankey Willems, who himself had no commission, and departed with Yanky from Boca del Toro in September sailing south along Colombia where Yanky captured a Spanish merchant ship carrying sugar and tobacco. Wright receiving Yanky's barque, as Yanky kept the merchant ship, burned his own ship and sold the Spanish tartane he had taken near Cartago to one of the Jamaican traders on board. At Cura\u00e7ao they attempted to sell the Spanish cargo but were forced to leave by the Dutch Governor. They continued to sail to the Isla Aves and Islas Roques where they remained until February 1682. Returning to Islas Roques later in 1682, Wright parted from Williems, where he and his crew divided their loot and dispersed. Wright may have returned to his home in French Hispaniola. William Dampier, who had been sailing as a member of Wrights's and Willems' crew, left with John Cook and others to return to Virginia before returning to buccaneering.\n Passage 3:Shmuel Zytomirski was born in Warsaw (now in Poland, but then in Imperial Russia) on September 16, 1900. His father, Ephraim (1880\u20131941), who was born in the little town of Medzhybizh () in Podolia (now in Ukraine) was a member of Hovevei Zion, a follower of the Mizrachi movement, one of the Yavne School founders in Lublin and an active member in a \"benefit society\" charity fund in Lublin.

Reitherman continued to work on a number of Disney shorts, including The Band Concert, Music Land, and Elmer Elephant. He animated the Slave in the Magic Mirror in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). His next assignments was animating Monstro in Pinocchio (1940), the climactic dinosaur fight in Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring in Fantasia (1940), and several scenes of Timothy Q. Mouse in Dumbo (1941). Starting in 1942, Reitherman had left Disney to serve in World War II for the United States Air Force, earning the Distinguished Flying Cross after serving in Africa, China, India and the South Pacific. He was discharged in February 1946 having earned the rank of Major. Reitherman rejoined Disney in April 1947, where he animated the Headless Horseman chase in \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" section in The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad (1949). Around this same time, he had claimed he was instrumental in helping Walt Disney commit to producing Cinderella (1950). Reitherman recalled, \"I just went in his office which I rarely did, and I said, 'Gee, that looks great. We ought to do do it.' It might have been a little nudge to say, 'Hey, let's get going again and let's do a feature'.\" On Cinderella, he was the directing animator of the sequence in which Jaq and Gus laboriously push and pull the key up the stairs to Cinderella. On Alice in Wonderland (1951), he animated the scene in which the White Rabbit's home is destroyed by an enlarged Alice. On Peter Pan (1953), he animated the scene of Captain Hook attempting to escape the crocodile. For Lady and the Tramp (1955), Reitherman animated the alley dog fight sequence and Tramp's fight with the rat in the nursery room. \n Passage 3:In February 2010, Breitbart received the Reed Irvine Accuracy in Media Award during the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, D.C. During his acceptance speech, he responded directly to accusations by The New York Times reporter Kate Zernike that Jason Mattera, a young conservative activist, had been using \"racial tones\" in his allusions to President Barack Obama, and had spoken in a \"Chris Rock voice\". From the podium, Breitbart called Zernike \"a despicable human being\" for having made such allegations about what, according to him, was just Mattera's Brooklyn accent. At the same conference, Breitbart was also filmed saying to journalist Max Blumenthal that he found him to be \"a jerk\" and \"a despicable human being\" over a blog entry in which Blumenthal accused Breitbart of employing a racist. Blumenthal was referring to James O'Keefe over his having attended a Georgetown Law Center discussion on race featuring Kevin Martin, John Derbyshire, and Jared Taylor, the last of whom founded American Renaissance, an online magazine widely considered white supremacist. Neither O'Keefe nor Breitbart endorsed Taylor's views.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:The tomb was originally a monumental temple at Golyama Kosmatka Mound, built in the second half of the 5th century BC. After extended use as a temple, at the later part of the 3rd century BC, Seuthes lll was buried inside. The sarcophagus-chamber contained personal belongings that were necessary for the afterlife of the King. It includes knee pads, a gilded helmet with images, leather armour with a collar (plastron made of golden threads), a large sword and spears. There are bronze vessels, and three big ceramic amphora which were filled with thick Thracian wine. The floor and the ritual bed are covered by a carpet woven in gold thread. The total weight of the gold including all the objects is more than one kilogram. There are thirteen gold appliques for horse halters with images of human, animals and plants - objects which are rare in Thracian archaeology. Another two rectangular objects are golden with figures of standing warriors, used as a decoration for the sword sheath. There is a massive circular decoration for the King's armour. The handle of the rod is also golden. In the grave are placed golden vessels with two handles for drinking wine, also called kiliks, and a remarkable golden wreath with twigs, leaves and acorns and many other items.\n Passage 2:And in any case, people in Texas came to identify with the song. The work of the Austin-based group Asleep at the Wheel helped to keep popular knowledge of Wills going, and they collaborated with Clint Black on a new version of \"Bob Wills Is Still the King\" on a 1999 tribute album Ride With Bob. Another recording of the song by Asleep at the Wheel, this time in collaboration with Waylon's son Shooter Jennings together with Randy Rogers and Reckless Kelly, appeared on the 2015 effort . The song itself is collected on several Jennings live sets, compilations, and box sets, including RCA Country Legends (2001 compilation, includes studio version),  Live from Austin, TX (recorded 1989, released 2006), and Nashville Rebel (2006 box set including studio version). Perhaps the most unexpected appearance was a performance by The Rolling Stones in Austin in 2006 during their A Bigger Bang Tour. Their arrangement featuring Ronnie Wood playing pedal steel guitar was captured on their 2007 The Biggest Bang concert DVD release.\n Passage 3:HMS Defender was a D-class destroyer built for the Royal Navy in the early 1930s. The ship was initially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet before she was transferred to the China Station in early 1935. She was temporarily deployed in the Red Sea during late 1935 during the Abyssinia Crisis, before returning to her assigned station where she remained until mid-1939. Defender was transferred back to the Mediterranean Fleet just before World War II began in September 1939. She briefly was assigned to West Africa for convoy escort duties in 1940 before returning to the Mediterranean. The ship participated in the Battles of Calabria, Cape Spartivento, and Cape Matapan over the next year without damage. Defender assisted in the evacuations from Greece and Crete in April\u2013May 1941, before she began running supply missions to Tobruk, Libya in June. The ship was badly damaged by a German bomber on one of those missions and had to be scuttled by her consort on 11 July 1941.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

In 1992, McBride & the Ride received a Best New Vocal Group or Duo nomination from the Country Music Association and Vocal Group of the Year nomination from the Academy of Country Music. More than four years after its release, Sacred Ground was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipping 500,000 copies. Despite these sales, McBride remarked that the band still nearly lost its recording contract, due to other artists on the label selling even more strongly.\n Passage 2:The old moraine landscape of Lower Saxony emerged in the course of four great glacial advances of the Scandinavian ice sheet 350,000 to 130,000 years ago \u2013 one during the Elster glaciation and three during the Saale glaciation. The glacier of the most recent, Weichselian glaciation only reached the northeastern edge of the present Elbe valley depression, so that the existing terminal moraines beyond that point there were only affected periglacially, for example in the shape of solifluction over the frozen ground, by meltwater erosion and sediments or through wind-blown deposits of sand. The last two Saale glaciation advances in particular, the Drenthe II and the Warthe stadia, unfolded the East Hanonerian Terminal Moraine. It is therefore geomorphologically younger than the geest in western and central Lower Saxony, but clearly older than the young moraine landscapes in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Ostholstein (=\u00a0Baltic Uplands).\n Passage 3:In addition to her club tour and many radio interviews, Simpson has made in-store appearances at Wal-Mart to meet with fans, and she has a number of television appearances planned for the weeks prior to and surrounding the album's release on April 22: on Nickelodeon's Kids Choice Awards on March 29, Total Request Live on April 17 (where she gave an interview and performed \"Little Miss Obsessive\"), the Today show on April 18 (where she gave an interview and performed \"Little Miss Obsessive\", along with her 2004 song from her debut album Autobiography, \"Pieces of Me\"), Dance on Sunset on April 20 (performing \"Little Miss Obsessive\"), The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on April 21 (where she performed \"Little Miss Obsessive\"), Dancing with the Stars on April 22 (where she performed \"Boys\"), The Ellen DeGeneres Show on April 24 (where she gave an interview and performed \"Little Miss Obsessive\"), and Jimmy Kimmel Live! on April 24 (where she performed \"Little Miss Obsessive\"). She subsequently went to Europe for more promotion, performing \"Outta My Head\" on television shows in the United Kingdom and Germany. In connection with the album release, clothing retailer Wet Seal launched a collection of tops designed by Simpson on April 22. According to Simpson, her inspirations for Bittersweet World were reflected in the clothing line. Wet Seal also planned to sell Bittersweet World in its stores and on its website, and planned to hold a contest for which the grand prize was to include a trip to meet Simpson and attend one of the concerts on her planned tour. Simpson's 12 date summer tour was subsequently cancelled. OK! Magazine reported on May 31 that Simpson cancelled her summer tour due to her pregnancy.

Dayan is the founder of \"Malchut Israel\", a right-wing religious-political group in Israel advocating a return of the monarchy. In 2004, he became a member of the newly reconstituted Sanhedrin, a duplicate of the religious tribunal which convened during the time of the Second Temple, a group that had traditionally had seventy-one members. He has also achieved certain notoriety for his alleged central participation in so-called \"death curse\" ceremonies or Pulsa diNura aimed at Yitzhak Rabin and Ariel Sharon. These curses were presumably to request divine retribution after those former Prime Ministers advocated Israeli withdrawal from certain areas considered by some as inalienable parts of the promised land. Incidentally, Yitzhak Rabin was murdered soon after the first curse, and Ariel Sharon left in a persistent vegetative state after a brain haemorrhage following the second. He is also known to have supported Baruch Goldstein's (a fellow Meir Kahane disciple) terrorist actions in the Cave of the Patriarch's Massacre.\n Passage 3:A distinction is often made between the island of New Guinea and what is known as Island Melanesia, which consists of \"the chain of archipelagos, islands, atolls, and reefs forming the outer bounds of the sheltered oval-shaped coral sea\".

However the Cleveland referenced in the song is not Cleveland, Ohio but likely Cleveland, Texas, a suburb of Houston which is also mentioned in the chorus -- \"Look out, Houston, there\u2019ll be thunder on the hill...\". \"Look Out Cleveland\" differs from most of the songs on The Band's first two albums in that is more influenced by urban blues music than by rural music.

Famous English actresses who have played the title role include Susannah Maria Cibber, who made her stage debut in the 1736 Drury Lane production, Sarah Siddons, and Elizabeth Younge. The first known professional performance of the play in the American Colonies was in Philadelphia on 26 December 1768, performed by the Hallam Company using the Aaron Hill version. The company took the play to New York City in 1769 and after the end of the Revolutionary War sporadically revived it there and in Philadelphia. The first professional performances after the hostilities ended were given in Baltimore in April 1782 by the Thomas Wall Company. Although the professional theatres were closed during the War, the play proved popular with the British Army.

Despite making regular appearances in his first season for La Viola, Chiesa was fighting for a place with Predrag Mijatovi\u0107 among others, and also had spells where he was out of form, and in the end only managed 6 goals in the league. In the 2000\u201301 season, Batistuta left for Roma and Fiorentina were plagued with injuries and financial problems. Meanwhile, Chiesa became the main striker for the club under manager Roberto Mancini, supported by playmaker Rui Costa, and scored 22 goals in 30 matches, finishing amongst the top 5 highest scorers in the league and helping Fiorentina to win the 2000\u201301 Coppa Italia over his former club, Parma, in the final; in the second leg at home, he set up Nuno Gomes's goal in a 1\u20131 draw, which allowed Fiorentina to clinch the title 2\u20131 on aggregate.

Galeazzo Ciano was Benito Mussolini's son-in-law. He served between June 1936 and his sacking by Mussolini on 5 February 1943 as Foreign Minister. Following the Grand Council vote of 24 July 1943 in which Ciano joined with the majority and opposed his father-in-law, voting to invite King Victor Emmanuel III to \"resume his full constitutional powers\", and the ensuing political take-over by General Pietro Badoglio, Ciano was on the receiving end of a vicious press campaign, deprived of a passport, and kept under virtual house arrest at his home in Italy. He began to fear for his personal safety and that of his family. On 27 August 1943 German intelligence arranged for Ciano and his family to be transported to Ciampino airfield, while avoiding the Italian police. Ciano was picked up by one car while his wife Edda and their three children were taken while walking in the park, by a different route, by another car, to a pre-assigned meeting point in the city where they were placed in a German army truck for the airport transfer. From Ciampino they were flown to Munich on board a Luftwaffe Ju 52 transport. What Ciano regarded as his escape was organised personally by Beetz's new boss Wilhelm H\u00f6ttl. For H\u00f6ttl and German Intelligence, the over-riding objective of the \"Ciano operation\" was to obtain Ciano's diaries and extensive supporting papers concerning his years at the heart of Italy's political establishment, which the German government feared might include incriminating or embarrassing information about relations between the two governments or, indeed, about the German foreign minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop (whom Ciano was known to hate). \n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

The club did, however, retain the FA Cup, with a 1\u20130 win against Southampton.

The team lost to Everton a month after Wenger's proclamation; teenager Wayne Rooney scored the match winner, which ended a run of 30 league games without defeat. By February 2003, Arsenal moved five points clear of Manchester United at the top of the league table, but injuries to key players, not least captain Patrick Vieira, had destabilised the team.

Passage 1:On 4 November 1877 the Russian army achieved a victory at Uzunahmet, having inflicted heavy casualties on the Turks, which included 3,000 killed and wounded, 1,000 prisoners and 42 artillery pieces left by the panicked gunners, with a loss of only 1,200 men. Although the Turkish troops ceased resistance and were fleeing in disarray, with 4,000 of them deserting the army, a part of their infantry maintained order and retreated to the well-fortified position in Erzurum with 14 guns. The Russians, being miles away and exhausted by the battle, did not chase them and therefore missed a chance to capture Erzurum on the heels of the fleeing enemy. Having developed a plan of assault on the stronghold, the Russian army advanced under the cover of night, but had difficulties of movement control in the dark. A part of their troops from the 153th Infantry Regiment mistook their direction and captured one of the redoubts, Azizieh, all by themselves, without help from the rest of the army, but had to leave it due to the lack of support. All the three Turkish battalions stationed in the Azizieh redoubt were routed, numbering 1,600, whereas the Russians lost 400 or 600 men in this battle. After the Russians left Azizieh, the Turks made an attempt to counterattack them, but were successfully driven back. As the works of Erzurum were too strong to be taken by assault, the siege park was needed at Kars and in the following days the weather set in with a snowstorm, the Russians decided to withdraw their army and instead attack Kars, which they succeeded in capturing. Ahmed Muhtar Pasha, the Ottoman commander during the siege, requested reinforcements from Istanbul and was receiving them all through November. After epidemics broke out, he withdrew his forces to Bayburt for the remainder of the war. Muhtar Pasha was awarded the title Ghazi for his role in the defence of Erzurum, Gedikler and Yahniler.

In the 2003 presidential elections, R\u00edos Montt unsuccessfully ran as the candidate of the Guatemalan Republican Front (FRG). In 2007 he returned to public office as a member of Congress, thereby gaining prosecutorial immunity. He was protected from a pair of long-running lawsuits alleging war crimes against him and a number of his former ministers and counselors during their term in the presidential palace in 1982\u201383.

The Anglo-Egyptian Nile Expeditionary Force included 25,800 men, 8,600 of whom were British. The remainder were troops belonging to Egyptian units that included six battalions recruited in southern Sudan. An armed river flotilla escorted the force, which also had artillery support. In preparation for the attack, the British established an army headquarters at the former rail head Wadi Halfa and extended and reinforced the perimeter defenses around Sawakin. In March 1896, the campaign started as the Dongola Expedition. Despite taking the time to reconstruct Ishma\u2018il Pasha's former gauge railway south along the east bank of the Nile, Kitchener captured the former capital of Nubia by September. The next year, the British then constructed a new rail line directly across the desert from Wadi Halfa to Abu Hamad, which they captured in the Battle of Abu Hamed on 7 August 1897. (The gauge, hastily adopted to make use of available rolling stock, meant supplies from the Egyptian network required transshipment via steamer from Asyut to Wadi Halfa. The Sudanese system retains the incompatible gauge to this day.)

It reunites Blomkamp with some of his District 9 crew, such as editor Julian Clarke, production designer Philip Ivey, cinematographer Trent Opaloch, and actor Sharlto Copley, playing one of the film's antagonists. Elysium is a co-production of TriStar Pictures and MRC. Although the film's story is set in 2154, Blomkamp has stated that it is a comment on the contemporary human condition. \"Everybody wants to ask me lately about my predictions for the future,\" the director has said, \"No, no, no. This isn't science fiction. This is today. This is now.\" In January 2011, independent studio Media Rights Capital met with major studios to distribute Elysium, and Blomkamp shared art designs of his proposed science fiction film. The art designs won over the executives at Sony Pictures, who bought the film after making a more attractive offer than the other studios. With a production budget of , production began in July 2011.

The role was then offered to rapper Eminem, but he wanted the film to be shot in Detroit. That was not an option for the two studios, so Blomkamp moved on to Damon as his next choice. Futuristic designs were executed by Philip Ivey after long periods of researching and studying older science fiction films. Ivey has continuously cited Syd Mead as a substantial influence for the film. Weta Workshop created the exosuits for Damon and Copley's characters, while the complicated visual effects were handled primarily by Image Engine (who also collaborated on District 9) with additional work by Whiskytree, MPC, The Embassy and Industrial Light and Magic.

Lt. Slaughter and his men plus Captain Hayes' force met the Indians at the crossing of the White River, and on 4 November 1855 fought without decisive results. The following day the troops met hostiles in the difficult country between the White and Green Rivers. The troops fell back into the valleys and on 24 November 1855, Lt. Slaughter, commanding a platoon of the 4th Infantry and a company of volunteers, was attacked in his camp at Puyallup. The lieutenant moved to the present site of Auburn and here again the Indians attacked. Slaughter and two corporals of the volunteer company were killed, four other men were injured, one later dying of his wounds. For years the town, which sprang up on this site, was known as Slaughter in honor of this officer of the 4th Infantry; it was later changed to Auburn.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:After the Conquest of Taraf in 1304, Shah Arifin Rafiuddin, a disciple of Shah Jalal, migrated and settled in present-day Tahirpur where he preached Islam to the local people. His khanqah also remains here in Sarping/Laurergarh but the part containing his mazar is on the other side of the border in Meghalaya on top of Laur Hill. Tahirpur contained the village of Nabagram, now in Badaghat Union, which served as the capital of the Laur Kingdom. In the 18th century, Tahirpur became a part of Brajendra Kishore Roy Chowdhury's zamindari based in Gouripur House in Mymensingh. Tahirpur was then a predominantly Hindu-populated area. During this period, the local council resolved a false accusation against a Bengali Muslim by the name of Tahir Ali. Following this, Tahir Ali settled in this area and named his village Tahirpur. Tahirpur was founded as a thana in 1924 named after the village of Tahirpur. During the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, refugee camps were set up in the nearby Khasi and Jaintia Hills. During the Bhashan Pani movement from 1997 to 1998, ten peasants were murdered with many also being arrested or kept confined.\n Passage 2:Having moved to Los Angeles, Reeves took acting classes at the Lee Strasberg Institute, and appeared in the movie Fairy Tales, and on the television series Quincy, ME. Reeves also appeared on game shows such as Hollywood Squares. In 1977, with the help of former Motown producer Frank Wilson, Reeves became a born-again Christian, joining the Mt. Zion Missionary Baptist Church, pastored by Rev. EV Hill. She released one album on Arista, working with Clive Davis, the Chairmen of the Board's General Johnson and others, and two albums on the Fantasy label, working with other former Motown colleagues Hank Cosby and Holland, Dozier and Holland.

In 1995, Reeves and the Vandellas were inducted to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and were inducted to the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2003. Martha performed as part of the halftime show of Super Bowl XXXII in 1998, with her sisters, and current Vandellas, Lois and Delphine Reeves. In 2004, Reeves released her first album in 24 years, Home to You, with songs she wrote and produced herself except for a Billie Holiday cover and an updated version of her big hit, \"Jimmy Mack\". Between leaving the Vandellas and her solo career, Martha served as an early contributor to the music newspaper, Soul, for which she was honored for by the Black Women in Publishing organization. She was also honored for her best-selling 1995 autobiography, Dancing in the Street.\n Passage 3:The 13th stage saw a big change in the general classification due to crosswinds leading to the formation of echelons. A 15 man group led by Alberto Contador's Team Saxo Bank, with the help of eventual stage winner Mark Cavendish's Omega Pharma-Quick Step and Bauke Mollema's Belkin Pro Cycling used the crosswinds to make a gap with other General Classification riders 31 kilometers from the finish to form the echelons.

Passage 1:The construction of the cathedral was approved in 1894 by the Ministry of Internal Affairs under Tsarist Russia. Groundbreaking was in 1899; construction work began in 1901 and was completed ten years later. Three-aisled and built from red brick, the cathedral is based on a design by architect Tomasz Bohdanowicz-Dworzecki. The style was influenced by Westminster Abbey and Milan Cathedral. With the help of funds from Catholic parishes in Russia and its neighbouring states, the church was consecrated as a chapel for Moscow's Polish parish in 1911. In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Provisional Government was overthrown by the Bolsheviks and Russia eventually became part of the Soviet Union in 1922. Because the promotion of state atheism was a part of Marxist\u2013Leninist ideology, the government ordered many churches closed; the cathedral was closed in 1938. During World War\u00a0II, it was threatened with demolition, and was used after the war for civil purposes, as a warehouse and then a hostel. Following the fall of communism in 1991, it returned to being a church in 1996. In 2002 it was elevated to the status of cathedral. Following an extensive and costly programme of reconstruction and refurbishment, the cathedral was reconsecrated in 2005.\n Passage 2:At the very beginning of the Occupation the devout rabbi and philosopher Yeshayahu Leibowitz thought the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza would imperil Judaism itself, and advocated immediate withdrawal. As the years passed, his antagonism to Israel's military successes led him to speak of \"Judeo-Nazis\" and the \"Nazification of Israeli society\", a position which did not stop him being nominated for the Israel Prize in 1993 by the government of Yitzhak Rabin. Israeli demographer Oren Yiftachel considers not only the settlement policy in the West Bank, but the state of Israel itself as an example of a Judaizing ethnocratic regime, which he defines as one that \"promote(s) the expansion of the dominant group in contested territory and its domination of power structures while maintaining a democratic fa\u00e7ade.\" The activist Jeff Halper speaks of a \"matrix of control\" underlying the occupation, while the Israeli philosopher Avishai Margalit, following the Indologist David Dean Shulman, speaks of its \"intricate machinery\". Neve Gordon analyses at length the attempts to so normalize things that an \"invisible occupation\" is created.\n Passage 3:A very large snowbelt in the United States exists on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, near the cities of Houghton, Marquette, and Munising. These areas average of snow each season. For comparison, on the western shore, Duluth, Minnesota receives per season. Lake Superior and Lake Huron rarely freeze because of their size and depth; hence, lake-effect snow can fall continually in the Upper Peninsula and Canadian snowbelts during the winter months. Main areas of the Upper Peninsula snow belt include the Keweenaw Peninsula and Baraga, Marquette and Alger counties, where Lake Superior contributes to lake-effect snow, making them a prominent part of the Midwestern snow belt. Records of of snow or more have been set in many communities in this area. The Keweenaw Peninsula averages more snowfall than almost anywhere in the United States\u2014more than anywhere east of the Mississippi River and the most of all non-mountainous regions of the continental United States. Because of the howling storms across Lake Superior, which cause dramatic amounts of precipitation, it has been said that the lake-effect snow makes the Keweenaw Peninsula the snowiest place east of the Rockies. Only one official weather station exists in this region. Located in Hancock, Michigan, this station averages well over per year. Farther north in the peninsula, lake-effect snow can occur with any wind direction. The road commission in Keweenaw County, Michigan collects unofficial data in a community called Delaware, and it strictly follows the guidelines set forth by the National Weather Service. This station averages over per season. Even farther north, a ski resort called Mount Bohemia receives an unofficial annual average of . Herman, Michigan, averages of snow every year. Lake-effect snow can cause blinding whiteouts in just minutes, and some storms can last days.\n", "output": "1", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

He was invited to play on the Who's album Who Are You (1978), but broke his arm falling out of a taxi at the studio door and was unable to participate in recording sessions. Bundrick toured with The Who from 1979 to 1981 along with drummer Kenney Jones and played on their album Face Dances (1981), then briefly parted with the band during the recording of It's Hard (1982) and the subsequent tour. Bundrick later rejoined the band performing with them at Live Aid in 1985 and played live with them until 2012.\n Passage 2:Harvard Crimson men's basketball program represents intercollegiate men's basketball at Harvard University. The team currently competes in the Ivy League in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and plays home games at the Lavietes Pavilion in Boston, Massachusetts. The team appeared in the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament in 2014, where Harvard upset 5-seed Cincinnati 61\u201357 before being eliminated in the round of 32 by 4-seed Michigan State by a score of 80\u201373.

Harvard thereby achieved its fourth straight NCAA Tournament appearance while preventing Yale from reaching the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 53 years. Harvard was eliminated from the 2015 NCAA Tournament by UNC by a score of 67\u201365 after leading with under one minute to play in the game. \n Passage 3:The book discusses four prehistoric migrations in India. The book mentions that the Harappans were a mixture of Zagros agriculturists and First Indians, a wave of migrants who came from Africa into Arabia and then reached India around 65,000 years ago. Citing recent DNA evidence, the book traces the subsequent large migrations of anatomically modern humans into India\u2014of agriculturalists from Iran between 7000 and 3000 BCE and Indo-European languages speaking pastoralists from the Central Asian Steppe (Aryans) between 2000 and 1000 BCE, among others. Tony Joseph used pizza as a metaphor to explain the break-up of subcontinental society. The book also discusses about similarities and differences between Indus Valley civilization and early Vedic civilization. The book mentions that \u2018Aryan\u2019 culture was most likely the result of interaction, adoption and adaptation among those who brought Indo-European languages to India and those who were already well-settled inhabitants of the region, and that Sanskrit and Vedas developed in the Indian subcontinent. Various tribes like the Andamanese and the Semang (Malay Peninsula), the Mani (Thailand) and the Aeta people (the Philippines) were the earliest inhabitants of Southeast Asia. According to Joseph, Proto-Dravidian is related to the Elamitic language of Iran. Caste system in India is a recent social system, reflected in sharply reduced inter-marriage (endogamy) and genetic mixing after 100 AD.

Passage 1:The Battle of Lexington and Concord was the first conflict in the American Revolutionary War. On April 19, 1775, a force of British Army regulars marched from Boston to Concord to capture a cache of arms that was reportedly stored in the town. Forewarned by Samuel Prescott (who had received the news from Paul Revere), the colonists mustered in opposition. Following an early-morning skirmish at Lexington, where the first shots of the battle were fired, the British expedition under the command of Lt. Col. Francis Smith advanced to Concord. There, colonists from Concord and surrounding towns (notably a highly drilled company from Acton led by Isaac Davis) repulsed a British detachment at the Old North Bridge and forced the British troops to retreat. Subsequently, militia arriving from across the region harried the British troops on their return to Boston, culminating in the Siege of Boston and the outbreak of the war.\n Passage 2:While in the Antarctic outpost in the pilot episode \"Rising\", Dr. Rodney McKay forces Beckett to sit in an Ancient control chair. Beckett's Ancient gene causes him to accidentally activate a drone weapon zeroing on General O'Neill and Major Sheppard's helicopter, but he manages to stop it. After finding and arriving in the city of Atlantis, Beckett examines a severed Wraith arm that Major Sheppard brought back from the planet Athos. Beckett can provide the first information about Wraith physiology and becomes the chief medical officer in Atlantis. In \"Hide and Seek\", he creates a gene therapy that emulates the ATA gene in normal humans with a 48 percent success rate. In \"Poisoning the Well\", Beckett helps the Hoffans develop a drug that kills the Wraith who feed on humans, but the drug has the side effect of killing 50 percent of the human recipients as well. One of the casualties is Perna, a Hoffan woman he has grown attached to. Carson leaves in disgust when the Hoffans decide to disseminate the drug among their people at all costs. In \"The Gift\", he discovers that Teyla has Wraith DNA in her genetic makeup, which allows her to tap into the Wraith psychic network in this and future episodes. In the second season, Beckett takes up more offworld activities, including one mission where he removes a Wraith tracker from Ronon Dex's spine in \"Runner\".\n Passage 3:\"Glamorous Sky\" is Mika Nakashima's 16th single overall, her 1st under the name Nana starring Mika Nakashima, and the second most successful single in her career after \"Stars\".

Olvir was the son of the viking Berle-Kari and brother-in-law of Kveldulf Bjalfason, who married Olvir's sister Salbjorg Karadottir; he was thus uncle to Skallagrim and Thorolf Kveldulfsson and great uncle to the famous poet Egil Skallagrimsson. Olvir also had a brother named Eyvind Lambi. Olvir was a prominent member of the court of King Harald Fairhair, who united Norway under his rule in the late ninth or early tenth century. Among other famous poets, he served as one of King Harald's court poets. He also served as a warrior in Harald's retinue, and fought at the pivotal Battle of Hafrsfjord on the king's flagship. He is best known for his involvement in the conflict between Harald and Olvir's kinsman Thorolf Kveldulfsson, which ended with the latter's death.

The collection also has examples of four different four-wheel drive Formula One cars, including an unraced Cosworth car. Another star exhibit is the Lotus 18 with which Stirling Moss won the 1961 Monaco Grand Prix, along with Jim Clark's World Championship-winning Lotus 25. Noticeable, however, is the distinct lack of Ferrari vehicles, 3 in all, but fine examples nonetheless. First being a Ferrari 312 driven by Chris Amon, second a 312B and thirdly, a Ferrari F2000 (The particular chassis driven to victory in the 2000 Canadian Grand Prix, one of nine victories for Michael Schumacher in his maiden championship winning series with Ferrari), conversely, the establishment houses the Jordan 191 in which he made his formula 1 debut in 1991.

Northamptonshire won the toss and decided to bat, scoring 215 all out with a top score of 49 by Vince Broderick while Essex's Test leg break and googly bowler Peter Smith took four for 65. By close of play on Saturday, Essex had replied to 170 for 4 with opener Chick Cray on 90 not out. He completed his century, exactly 100, on Monday morning and Essex went on to total 267 all out. Northamptonshire were 219 for 5 at the close on Monday evening with their veteran batsman John Timms on 90 not out. Timms was out for 112 on Tuesday morning and Peter Smith completed ten in the match by taking six for 84 in the Northamptonshire total of 291. Essex therefore needed 240 to win with ample time left on the final day. They had a good stand of 103 for the fourth wicket between Frank Vigar (60) and Len Clark (64) but spinners Broderick and Bertie Clarke kept picking up the wickets and Essex were still ten behind when the ninth went down. The last pair were captain Tom Pearce and wicketkeeper Tom Wade who managed to level the scores before Wade was bowled by Clarke to tie the match.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

However, surface data in the vicinity did not indicate a closed circulation until 12 UTC on June 20. At 14 UTC that day, an Air Force reconnaissance plane located near 24\u00b0N 84\u00b0W reported gale-force winds of (). At the time, this was taken to indicate that a tropical storm had formed about northwest of Swan Island. Reanalysis by the Hurricane Research Division in 2013, however, determined that a tropical storm formed farther northwest, near 19\u00b0N 86\u00b0W. Squally weather, and winds of moderate tropical storm force, was reported in connection with the tropical storm as it moved generally northward, toward the Yucat\u00e1n Channel. Little strengthening occurred over the next two days, until after 12 UTC on June 22. At that time, a period of rapid deepening commenced: within 24 hours, the cyclone increased its winds from to . At the same time, its track made a sharp bend toward the northeast, threatening the Florida peninsula. While no central pressure was recorded, Hurricane Hunter aircraft flew into the storm on June 23 and reported winds of at 2015 UTC. As with most early reconnaissance data, such readings are suspect; however, based upon the reconnaissance measurement, the storm was originally listed in the Atlantic hurricane database as a Category 3 hurricane. Later, reanalysis lowered this estimate to , equal to Category 2 on the modern Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, due primarily to the absence of corroboration. After peaking late on June 23, the storm quickly lost intensity.\n Passage 2:In the early 1980s, Spielberg began to develop a film with Walt Disney Pictures that would have closely followed the storyline of the 1924 silent film and 1953 animated film. He also considered directing it as a musical with Michael Jackson in the lead. Jackson expressed interest in the part, but was not interested in Spielberg's vision of an adult Peter Pan who had forgotten about his past. The project was taken to Paramount Pictures, where James V. Hart wrote the first script with Dustin Hoffman already cast as Captain Hook. It entered pre-production in 1985 for filming to begin at sound stages in England. Elliot Scott had been hired as production designer. With the birth of his first son, Max, in 1985, Spielberg decided to drop out. \"I decided not to make Peter Pan when I had my first child,\" Spielberg commented. \"I didn't want to go to London and have seven kids on wires in front of blue screens. I wanted to be home as a dad.\" Around this time, he considered directing Big, which carried similar motifs and themes with it. In 1987, he \"permanently abandoned\" it, feeling he expressed his childhood and adult themes in Empire of the Sun.\n Passage 3:Presidential elections were held in South Korea on 19 December 2012. They were the sixth presidential elections since democratization and the establishment of the Sixth Republic, and was held under a first-past-the-post system, in which there was a single round of voting and the candidate receiving the highest number of votes was elected. Under the South Korean constitution, presidents are restricted to a single five-year term in office. The term of incumbent president Lee Myung-bak ended on 24 February 2013. According to the Korea Times, 30.7 million people voted with turnout at 75.8%. Park Geun-hye of the Saenuri party was elected the first female South Korean president with 51.6% of the vote opposed to 48.0% for her opponent Moon Jae-in.

The 1909\u201310 season saw six teams representing the Highland Light Infantry, the Royal Welch Fusiliers, the Durham Light Infantry, the Sherwood Foresters, the King's Regiment and Haulbowline all playing in the Munster League First Division. In the Munster Cup the Highland Light Infantry lost 1\u20130 to the Royal Welsh Fusilers in the final played at Turner's Cross. However this league was effectively disbanded during the First World War and Irish War of Independence era. In 1921 Harry Buckle, a former Ireland international, settled in Cork and began working for the Ford Motor Company. Finding little or no association football activity in the city, Buckle initially founded Fordsons F.C. and then helped found the County Cork\u2013based South Munster League for the team to play in. In addition to playing and coaching with the new club, Buckle also served as president of the Tipperary/Limerick based \u2013 North Munster League and helped reform the Munster Football Association. By 1922\u201323 the South Munster League and North Munster Leagues had effectively merged to become the Munster Senior League. Barrackton United of the South Munster League became the first post\u2013First World War Munster Senior League champions after defeating Cahir Park F.C. of the North Munster League in a play-off.\n Passage 3:Khalid was a member of the Shayban tribe, dominant in the region of Diyar Bakr in the northern Jazira, and third son of Yazid ibn Mazyad al-Shaybani, who served twice as Arab governor (ostikan) of Arminiya (a large province encompassing the whole of Transcaucasia). Khalid served in the same office no less than four times: in 813/814, 828\u2013832, briefly in 841 and again under Caliph al-Wathiq (r. 842\u2013845). In his first tenure, he showed himself conciliatory towards the native Christian population and the nakharar princes, but his second tenure was marked by the brutal suppression of several revolts by local Arab magnates, as well as the harsh treatment of the Christian population. As a result, when his re-appointment to the office was announced in 841, a rebellion broke out, forcing the Abbasid government to recall him immediately. Nevertheless, al-Wathiq assigned Arminiya to Khalid. The latter arrived in the province at the head of an army, and crushed any opposition. He died soon after at Dvin, where he was buried. He was succeeded by his son, Muhammad. His younger son Haytham ibn Khalid ruled in the family's stronghold of Shirvan, and was the first to claim the title of Shirvanshah.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

In August 1969 Drees was appointed as Treasurer-General of the Ministry of Finance, serving from 1 September 1969 until 8 January 1971. In December 1970 Drees was approached by the Chairman of the newly founded Democratic Socialists '70 Jan van Stuijvenberg to seek the leadership for the election of 1971. Drees accepted and was unopposed in his candidacy and was elected as Leader and became the Lijsttrekker (top candidate) of the Democratic Socialists '70 for the election on 8 January 1971, he resigned as Treasurer-General that same day.

After spending sabbaticals in England at the University of Bristol in 1971 and with Alec Bangham in 1975, Deamer became interested in liposomes. Conversations with Bangham inspired his research on the role of membranes in the origin of life, and in 1985 Deamer demonstrated that the Murchison carbonaceous meteorite contained lipid-like compounds that could assemble into membranous vesicles. Deamer described the significance of self-assembly processes in his 2011 book First Life. In collaborative work with Mark Akeson, a post-doctoral student at the time, the two established methods for monitoring proton permeation through ion channels such as gramicidin. In 1989, while returning from a scientific meeting in Oregon, Deamer conceived that it might be possible to sequence single molecules of DNA by using an imposed voltage to pull them individually through a nanoscopic channel. The DNA sequence could be distinguished by the specific modulating effect of the four bases on the ionic current through the channel. In 1993, he and Dan Branton initiated a research collaboration with John Kasianowitz at NIST to explore this possibility with the hemolysin channel, and in 1996 published the first paper demonstrating that nanopore sequencing may be feasible. George Church at Harvard had independently proposed a similar idea, and Church, Branton and Deamer decided to initiate a patent application which was awarded in 1998. Mark Akeson joined the research effort in 1997, and in 1999 published a paper showing that the hemolysin channel, now referred to as a nanopore, could distinguish between purine and pyrimidine bases in single RNA molecules. In 2007, Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) licensed the patents describing the technology and in 2014 released the MinION nanopore sequencing device to selected researchers. The first publications appeared in 2015, one of which used the MinION to sequence E. coli DNA with 99.4% accuracy relative to the established 5.4 million base pair genome. Despite earlier skepticism, nanopore sequencing is now accepted as a viable third generation sequencing method. The original 1996 paper has been cited over 2000 times in the scientific literature, and in 2017, twenty one years later, a Google search for nanopore sequencing returned 226,000 results.\n Passage 3:After his rise to power in 1805, Muhammad Ali Pasha embarked on consolidating his power and building an empire. His way of achieving that was to modernize Egypt and to build a European style strong army and a modern system of government. His desire for modernization fueled many new establishments such as the first modern military school, educational institutions, hospitals, roads and canals, factories to turn out uniforms and munitions, and a shipbuilding foundry at Alexandria. He established the school of Engineering (Mohandes Khana) in 1820 to provide the engineers and scientists he would need to carry out all the great projects he had planned. Impressed by the scientific and cultural aspects of the French Expedition (1798\u20131801), Muhammad Ali relied on French scientists and craftsmen to help him modernize Egypt. French engineer Pascal Coste was the first engineer hired by Muhammad Ali in 1817 to help him construct his ambitious projects. Coste worked on some small projects first, then came his biggest when he was appointed by Muhammad Ali as the Chief Engineer for Lower Egypt. This was the highest engineering post in Egypt at the time since most of Muhammad Ali's work to improve irrigation was concentrated in this region of the Nile Delta. Under his new position, Coste started working on constructing the Mahmoudiyah canal, the first of a long list of great irrigation projects that were to be constructed in that era.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:Hirst was born in 1838 in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, England. He received his education at Huddersfield College. He arrived at Port Chalmers in Otago on the Agra on 30 October 1858 and first settled in the Te Anau / Manapouri area in Southland. Together with John Charles Watts-Russell of Christchurch, he explored Breaksea Sound for open land for sheep farming, but they were unsuccessful in this venture. Next, Hirst settled at Riverton where he had a butchery. In 1860, he married a daughter of William Dallas. In August 1861, he was the first who managed to drive cattle from Southland to the Gabriel's Gully gold field during the Otago Gold Rush. Some time later, Hirst was farming at Orepuki. When gold was discovered in the locality in 1866, the government resumed the land that he was farming, and he bought another property in the town where he lived for the rest of his life.\n Passage 2:After earning his master's degree from the University of Southern California, Shields went to Northwest Nazarene College in Nampa, Idaho. He was acting as president of the college there when he left for North Scituate, Rhode Island to replace President J.E.L. Moore at the Eastern Nazarene College on the advice of John W. Goodwin. When the college moved to Wollaston, Massachusetts, in Quincy, in 1919, Shields moved with the school. He was president of the college from 1919 to 1923, during which time he attended Harvard Graduate School of Education. After relinquishing the presidency at Eastern Nazarene, Shields taught at Connecticut Women's College in New London, Connecticut before returning to his alma mater, Pasadena College, to teach education and psychology, where he was awarded an honorary doctor of divinity in 1935. In 1935, after receiving his honorary doctorate from Pasadena, he returned to Eastern Nazarene to teach. Shields took the pastorate at Bethany Nazarene Church in Rumford, Rhode Island in 1941, after his return to Eastern Nazarene in 1935.\n Passage 3:Martin Guptill was ruled out of New Zealand's limited-overs squads due to injury.

Since he took office in December 2016 he has made 47 foreign visits to 19 different countries, with 20 of those visits being to Russia. In late October 2019, he visited Istanbul to attend the opening ceremony of Istanbul Airport as well as the ceremony for the Turkish Republic's 95th anniversary. In February and September 2019 respectively, he attended the Munich Security Conference in Germany and the Seventy-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York City both for the first time. During the UN visit, he referred to his attendance as \"a successful one\" during which he and his delegation \"were able to promote the interests and aspirations of the Republic of Moldova on the international arena\". He attended the 2018 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony in Moscow in June 2018 and the 2019 European Games in Minsk just over a year later.

The title was followed by another two Dutch Cups in 1994 (beating NEC 2\u20131) and 1995 (beating Volendam 2\u20131). During the 1994\u201395 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, Feyenoord reached the quarter finals after beating Werder Bremen in the second round. They eventually lost to Real Zaragoza. In the quarter-finals in the 1995 KNVB Cup, Feyenoord visited Ajax, which would win the 1994\u201395 UEFA Champions League later that season. Ajax was leading 1\u20130 when Ruud Heus equalised with a penalty just before full time. In extra time, Feyenoord became the only team to defeat Ajax the same season they won the Eredivisie and the Champions League unbeaten. The goal scored by Mike Obiku was the decider as the new golden goal rule became in use. During the 1995\u201396 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, Everton and Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach were beaten.

Feyenoord were eliminated in the semi-finals by a Carsten Jancker-inspired Rapid Wien.\n Passage 3:The 1799 campaign in Italy began with the Battle of Verona, a series of costly but indecisive clashes around Verona on 26 March. At the Battle of Magnano on 5 April, the Habsburg Austrian army of Paul Kray triumphed over the Republican French army of Barth\u00e9lemy Louis Joseph Sch\u00e9rer. While suffering losses of 4,000 killed and wounded and 2,000 captured, Kray's Austrians inflicted casualties of 3,500 killed and wounded and captured 4,500 men, 18 artillery pieces and seven colors from the French. Two days later, a distraught Sch\u00e9rer begged to be relieved of command. Michael von Melas arrived to take command of the Austrian army from Kray on 9 April. Hearing that 12,000 Austrians were approaching from the Tyrol to the north, Sch\u00e9rer abandoned the line of the Mincio River on 12 April. Leaving 12,000 troops in the fortress of Mantua and 1,600 more in Peschiera del Garda, the demoralized French commander ordered his crippled army to withdraw. As the soldiers fell back, the skies opened up and turned the retreat into a sodden nightmare.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:On 12 May 1990 the leaders of the Baltic republics signed a joint declaration known as the Baltic Entente. By mid-June the Soviets started negotiations with the Baltic republics on condition they agreed to freeze their declarations of independence. The Soviets had a bigger challenge elsewhere, in the form of the Russian Federal Republic proclaiming sovereignty in June. Simultaneously the Baltic republics also started to negotiate directly with the Russian Federal Republic. In Autumn 1990, they set up a customs border between the Baltic states, the Russian Federation and Belarus. After the failed negotiations the Soviets made a dramatic attempt to break the deadlock and sent troops to Lithuania and Latvia in January 1991. The attempts failed, dozens of civilians were killed, and the Soviet troops decided to retreat. In August 1991, the hard-line members of the Soviet government attempted to take control of the Soviet Union. One day after the coup on 21 August, the Estonians proclaimed independence. Shortly afterwards Soviet paratroops seized the Tallinn television tower. The Latvian parliament made similar a declaration at the same day. The coup failed but the Collapse of the Soviet Union became unavoidable. On 28 August, the European Community welcomed the restoration of the sovereignty and independence of the Baltic states. The Soviet Union recognised the Baltic independence on 6 September 1991. The Russian troops stayed for an additional three years, as Boris Yeltsin linked the issue of Russian minorities with troop withdrawals. Lithuania was the first to have the Russian troops withdrawn from its territory in August 1993. On 26 July 1994 Russian troops withdrew from Estonia and on 31 August 1994, Russian troops withdrew from Latvia. The Russian Federation ended its military presence in Estonia after it relinquished control of the nuclear facilities in Paldiski on 26 September 1995 and in Latvia after Skrunda-1 suspended operations on 31 August 1998 and subsequently dismantled. The last Russian soldier left Skrunda-1 in October 1999, thus marking a symbolic end to the Russian military presence on the soil of the Baltic countries.\n Passage 2:\"Any Ol' Barstool\" is a song written by Deric Ruttan and Josh Thompson and recorded by American country music artist Jason Aldean. It was released in December 5, 2016 by Broken Bow Records as the third single from Aldean's seventh album They Don't Know (2016). \"Any Ol' Barstool\" gave Aldean his thirteenth number-one hit on the US Billboard Country Airplay chart and his eleventh top 5 hit on the Hot Country Songs chart. It also reached outside the top 50 on the Hot 100 chart. The song achieved similar chart success in Canada, reaching number one on the Canada Country chart and number 100 on the Canadian Hot 100 chart. It was certified Gold by Music Canada for selling over 40,000 units in that country. An accompanying music video for the single, directed by Shaun Silva, features Aldean playing in an empty bar against the story of a quarreling couple.\n Passage 3:Nueces is Spanish for \"nuts\", and refers to the pecan trees that grew along the banks of the Nueces River, noted by Spanish explorer Alonso De Le\u00f3n in 1689. It is unclear when the name was given to the bay; it was called San Miguel Arc\u00e1ngel by Spanish captain Joaqu\u00edn de Orobio y Basterra in 1747, and an 1835 map of Texas identified it as Papelote or \"wastepaper\" Bay. It appears to have been first noted on a Spanish map in 1527 as the mouth of the R\u00edo Escondido or hidden river, which is believed to be the Nueces. French explorer Ren\u00e9 Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle sailed into the bay in 1685, mistakenly believing it was the Mississippi River. Spanish colonial governor Jos\u00e9 de Escand\u00f3n planned a villa on the mouth of the Nueces River named Villa de Vedoya. Fifty families were sent the site in 1749, but failed to establish a settlement, due to a lack of sufficient supplies. Later that century, missionaries discussed the possibility of moving Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Refugio Mission to the site, but decided against the idea due to conflict with the Lipan Apaches. Germans attempted to settle the same area, but were turned away by the French during the Pastry War in the 1830s. The next decade, a colony for freed slaves was proposed by abolitionist Benjamin Lundy, who had to cancel after the outbreak of the Texas Revolution.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Its age ranges from approximately 4.4 to 0.478 million years BP, spanning the late Pliocene and early to middle Pleistocene epochs. It comprises a range of marine and estuarine sands, gravels, silts and clays deposited in a relatively shallow-water, tidally-dominated marine embayment on the western margins of the North Sea basin. The sands are characteristically dark green from glauconite but weather bright orange, with haematite 'iron pans' forming. The lithology of the lower part of the Group is almost entirely flint. The highest formation in the Group, the Wroxham Crag, contains over 10% of far-travelled lithologies, notably quartzite and vein quartz from the Midlands, igneous rocks from Wales, and chert from the Upper Greensand of southeastern England. This exotic rock component was introduced by rivers such as the Bytham River and Proto-Thames. \n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:Gorham's Rangers was one of the most famous and effective ranger units raised in the colonial North America. Formed by John Gorham, the unit served as the prototype for many subsequent ranger forces, including the better known Rogers' Rangers. The unit started out as a Massachusetts provincial auxiliary company, which means it was not part of the province's normal militia system. Recruited in the summer of 1744 at the start of King George's War, Governor William Shirley ordered the unit raised as reinforcements for the then-besieged British garrison at Fort Anne in Annapolis Royal. Over the next eight years the unit proved remarkably effective at suppressing Acadian and Mi'kmaq resistance to British rule in Nova Scotia and helped to both expand and secure the British sphere of influence in the region. Initially a sixty-man all-Indian company led by British colonial officers, the original Native American members of the unit were gradually replaced by Anglo-Americans and recent Scots and Irish immigrants and were a minority in the unit by the mid-1750s. The company were reconnaissance experts as well as renowned for their expertise at both water-borne operations and frontier guerrilla warfare. They were known for surprise amphibious raids on Acadian and Mi'kmaq coastal or riverine settlements, using large whaleboats, which carried between ten and fifteen rangers each. This small unit was the main British military force defending Nova Scotia from 1744 to 1749. The company became part of the British army and was expanded during the Seven Years' War and went on to play an important role in fighting in Nova Scotia as well as participating in many of the important campaigns of the war, particularly distinguishing itself at the Siege of Quebec in 1759.\n Passage 2:He tied the UT freshman record for rebounds in a game (LaSalle Thompson, 1979\u201380) with 17 boards at Texas Tech.

His put-back of a Kris Clack miss with 15 seconds left proved to be the game-winner in UT's 81-80 Big Monday victory at Texas A&M. Mihm got a piece of Rayford Young's last-second shot to preserve an 82-80 win at Texas Tech, he has hit a pair of free throws with eight seconds left to provide the final margin in an 86-83 UT win over Texas Tech in the first round of the Big 12 Tournament.

Passage 1:In English, ottava rima first appeared in Elizabethan translations of Tasso and Ariosto. The form also became popular for original works, such as Michael Drayton's The Barons' Wars, Thomas Heywood's Troia Britannica, or Aemilia Lanyer's Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum. William Browne's Britannia's Pastorals also contains passages in ottava rima. The first English poet to write mock-heroic ottava rima was John Hookham Frere, whose 1817-8 poem Prospectus and Specimen of an Intended National Work used the form to considerable effect. Lord Byron read Frere's work and saw the potential of the form. He quickly produced Beppo, his first poem to use the form. Shortly after this, Byron began working on his Don Juan (1819\u20131824), probably the best-known English poem in ottava rima. Byron also used the form for The Vision of Judgment (1822). Shelley translated the Homeric Hymns into English in ottava rima. In the 20th century, William Butler Yeats used the form in several of his best later poems, including \"Sailing to Byzantium\" and \"Among School Children\". So did Kenneth Koch for instance in his autobiographical poem \"Seasons on Earth\" of 1987. In America Emma Lazarus wrote the poem An Epistle that consists of thirty four ottava rimas.

She later became the head of the Molecular Biology Group at the Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology of the institute and holds the position of a Grade IV staff scientist. At her laboratory, she hosts many research scholars who are involved in the studies in the disciplines of cell signaling and signal transduction, immunity, macrophage biology and tuberculosis.\n Passage 3:Hurricane Dorian was the strongest hurricane to affect the Bahamas on record, causing catastrophic damage in the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama in early September 2019. The fifth tropical cyclone, fourth named storm, second hurricane, and first major hurricane of the annual hurricane season, Dorian originated from a westward traveling tropical wave that was located over a thousand miles east of the Windward Islands on August\u00a023. The disturbance rapidly organized and became a tropical depression and later a tropical storm, both on August\u00a024. The newly formed Dorian struggled to intensify over the next few days due to a combination of dry air and vertical wind shear. The storm passed over Barbados and entered the Caribbean Sea on August\u00a026 as it gradually strengthened. Dorian made landfall in St. Lucia on the next day, which caused serious disruption to the system's structure. Initially predicted to strike Hispaniola, Dorian's track gradually shifted to the east as the storm neared Greater Antilles. Due to land interaction and the dry air, Dorian's center reformed north of its previous location, causing the system's track to shift northward. The storm then turned towards the northwest as it traveled through a weakness in a ridge. A combination of the dry air and shear relaxing as well as the warm sea surface temperatures, allowed Dorian to become a Category\u00a01 hurricane as it passed over St. Thomas on August\u00a028. The storm developed an eye in satellite imagery soon after, but dry air still continued to disrupt the system. The commencement of an eyewall replacement cycle on August\u00a029 temporarily impeded intensification, but Dorian completed the cycle the next morning and soon resumed strengthening.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

The builder was Kempe Gowda I, a vassal of the Vijaynagar Empire and the founder of Bangalore. Hyder Ali in 1761 replaced the mud fort with a stone fort and it was further improved by his son Tipu Sultan in the late 18th century. It was damaged during an Anglo-Mysore war in 1791. It still remains a good example of 18th-century military fortification.The army of the British East India Company, led by Lord Cornwallis on 21 March 1791 captured the fort in the siege of Bangalore during the Third Mysore War (1790\u20131792). At the time the fort was a stronghold for Tipu Sultan. Today, the fort's Delhi gate, on Krishnarajendra Road, and two bastions are the primary remains of the fort. A marble plaque commemorates the spot where the British breached fort's wall, leading to its capture. The old fort area also includes Tipu Sultan's Summer Palace, and his armoury. The fort has provided the setting for the treasure hunt in the book Riddle of the Seventh Stone.\n Passage 2:The Life, also known as We Are ODST is a television and cinema advertisement launched in 2009 by Microsoft to promote the first person shooter  in the United States. The 150-second piece follows a young soldier through enlistment, training, and battle as an Orbital Drop Shock Trooper (ODST), analogous to a paratrooper that drops from space to a battlefield. The Life was created by advertising agency T.A.G., an offshoot of McCann Erickson. Production of the commercial itself was handled by production company Morton/Jankel/Zander (MJZ). It was directed by Rupert Sanders, and post-production was conducted by Asylum. It was filmed in Hungary, just outside Budapest in a coal mine and abandoned factories to give the sequence an \"Eastern Bloc\" aesthetic. The commercial and its associated campaign proved hugely successful; on the week of its launch, Halo 3: ODST became the top-selling game for the Xbox 360 worldwide, and over 2.5 million copies were sold within the first few weeks of release. The Life went on to win a number of honours from the advertising and entertainment industries, including two Clio Awards, a London International Advertising Award and several honours from the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival, the most prestigious awards ceremony in the advertising industry.\n Passage 3:Caesar crossed the Rubicon accompanied by the XIII Legion to take power from the senate in the same way that Sulla had done in the past. Formally declared an enemy of the state, Caesar pursued the Senatorial party, now led by Pompey, who abandoned the city to raise arms in Greece. Cato was sent to Sicily to secure control of the grain supply. After securing control of Italy, Caesar sent the praetor Curio with four legions to Sicily. Cato's garrison was insufficient to withstand a force of this magnitude, he abandoned the island and went to Greece to join Pompey. After first reducing Caesar's army at the siege battle of Dyrrhachium, where Cato commanded the port, the army led by Pompey was ultimately defeated by Caesar in the Battle of Pharsalus (Cato wasn't present during the battle, Pompey had left him in command of Dyrrhachium). Cato and Metellus Scipio, however, did not concede defeat and escaped to the province of Africa with fifteen cohorts to continue resistance from Utica. Caesar pursued Cato and Metellus Scipio after installing the queen Cleopatra VII on the throne of Egypt, and in February 46 BC the outnumbered Caesarian legions defeated the army led by Metellus Scipio at the Battle of Thapsus. Acting against his usual strategy of clemency, Caesar did not accept surrender of Scipio's troops, but had them all slaughtered.\n", "output": "2", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:The Cincinnati Red Stockings, established in 1869 as the first openly all-professional baseball team, voted to dissolve after the 1870 season. Player-manager Harry Wright, with brother George and two other Cincinnati players, then went to Boston, Massachusetts at the invitation of Boston Red Stockings founder Ivers Whitney Adams to form the nucleus of the Boston Red Stockings, a charter member of the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP). The original Boston Red Stockings team and its successors can lay claim to being the oldest continuously playing team in American professional sports. (The only other team that has been organized as long, the Chicago Cubs, did not play for the two years following the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.) Two young players hired away from the Forest City club of Rockford, Illinois, turned out to be the biggest stars during the NAPBBP years: pitcher Al Spalding (founder of Spalding sporting goods) and second baseman Ross Barnes.\n Passage 2:In 1922, Mackenzie published Ancient Man in Britain, a work covering the history of Britain from Upper Paleolithic times, from a strong ethnological basis. The foreword of the book was written by Grafton Elliot Smith. The work covers the earliest settlement of Britain by the first modern humans from around 35,000 years ago during the Aurignacian (pp.\u00a019\u201327). In the book, Mackenzie maintains that the Caucasoid Cro-Magnons who settled in Britain were dark haired and dark eyed, racially akin to the French Basques, Iberians and Berbers of North Africa (p.\u00a025), who he theorised were one of the earliest representatives of the Mediterranean race. This indigenous proto-Mediterranean racial stock was later invaded by another \"variety of the Mediterranean race\" who initiated the Solutrean culture around 20,000 years ago (p.\u00a050). According to Mackenzie, the Aurignacian and Solutrean peoples of Britain traded in shells with Cro-Magnons of France. They later intermingled with later arriving Caucasoid racial types, including the proto-Alpines (Furfooz race), who were brachycelphalic (broad-skulled) and a Lappid race, who had minor Eskimo phenotypic traits. Mackenzie also believed that there was a highly depigmentated racial type in small numbers in Britain during the Magdalenian, perhaps who were also blonde, who intermingled with the \"dark Iberians\" (p.\u00a060). During the Neolithic, Mackenzie believed that the predominant racial type of Britain continued to be Mediterranoid: \"The carriers of Neolithic culture were in the main Iberians of Mediterranean racial type\" (p.\u00a0126) who traded in pearls and ores. Regarding Bronze Age Britain, Mackenzie devoted several chapters supporting his theory that traders and \"prospectors\" (miners) arrived in Britain c. 2500 BC, originally from the Eastern Mediterranean (pp.\u00a098\u2013101). This theory was initially developed by Harold Peake, who coined the term \"Prospector Theory\". In the scientific literature of Carleton S. Coon (1939), the theory was revived, and the Mediterraneans who colonised Britain during the late Neolithic or Bronze Age were associated with the Medway megaliths (or long-barrow Megalithic culture). Joseph Deniker earlier called these colonists \"Atlanto-Mediterranean\". Mackenzie believed that these Mediterraneans who colonised parts of Britain survived well into later historic periods (p.\u00a0118) and that the Mediterranean race in general was the bulk racial stock of Britain from Paleolithic through to the Neolithic and to more recent periods. They had black or brown hair, and swarthy skin \"like those of the Southern Italians\" (p.\u00a0126) and have survived in numerous pockets of Britain to the modern day (p.\u00a0139) despite that the later Anglo-Saxon and Norse settlement, who were fairer in appearance, Mackenzie believed their genetic input or admixture was very limited but that they subjugated the British imposing a new civilization and culture (p.\u00a0227).\n Passage 3:Although in 2008 Baseball America projected Venable as an every day starter for the Padres in 2010, some experts questioned whether he would be a long-term solution in center field for the team. Venable started the 2009 season with the Padres' Triple-A affiliate, Portland Beavers, but he was recalled by the Padres on June 3. His father, Max, served as the Beavers' hitting coach in 2009. Following the July 5 trade of Scott Hairston to the Oakland Athletics, Venable shared right field with Kyle Blanks. On July 12 against the San Francisco Giants, he had his first home run of the season in his first career four-hit game. Between July 30 and August 5, he homered in five of seven games. In an August 23 game against the St. Louis Cardinals, he was involved in a bench-clearing incident when Albert Pujols thought he threw an elbow while being tagged out. In 2009, he posted 12 home runs and tallied 38 runs batted in (RBI), while defensively 493.2 of his 643 innings were spent in right field and only 117 in center field.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Passage 1:Rendell had begun to play the piano aged five, but switched to saxophone in his teens. While he began his working life in the Southgate branch of Barclay's Bank, he soon left to become a professional musician. He began his career on alto saxophone but changed to tenor saxophone in 1943. During the rest of the 1940s, he was in the bands of George Evans and Oscar Rabin. Beginning in 1950, he spent three years in a septet led by Johnny Dankworth. He performed with Billie Holiday in Manchester, England, before playing in the bands of Tony Crombie and Ted Heath. After touring in Europe with Stan Kenton, he played in Cyprus with Tony Kinsey. He was a member of Woody Herman's Anglo American Herd in 1959. During the late 1950s and early 1960s he led bands, including one with Ian Carr that lasted until 1969, one with Barbara Thompson in the 1970s, and as the sole leader in the 1980s and 1990s. In particular, the Rendell-Carr Quintet gained an international reputation. It performed at the Antibes Festival, France and was the Band of the Year for three years in succession in the Melody Maker poll. He performed in festivals in England and France and worked with Johnny Dankworth, Michael Garrick, and Brian Priestley.\n Passage 2:Most of the early colonies were generally not tolerant of dissident forms of worship, with Maryland being one of the exceptions. For example, Roger Williams found it necessary to found a new colony in Rhode Island to escape persecution in the theocratically dominated colony of Massachusetts. The Puritans of the Massachusetts Bay Colony were the most active of the New England persecutors of Quakers, and the persecuting spirit was shared by Plymouth Colony and the colonies along the Connecticut river. In 1660, one of the most notable victims of the religious intolerance was English Quaker Mary Dyer, who was hanged in Boston, Massachusetts for repeatedly defying a Puritan law banning Quakers from the colony. As one of the four executed Quakers known as the Boston martyrs, the hanging of Dyer on the Boston gallows marked the beginning of the end of the Puritan theocracy and New England independence from English rule, and in 1661 King Charles II explicitly forbade Massachusetts from executing anyone for professing Quakerism. Anti-Catholic sentiment appeared in New England with the first Pilgrim and Puritan settlers. In 1647, Massachusetts passed a law prohibiting any Jesuit Roman Catholic priests from entering territory under Puritan jurisdiction. Any suspected person who could not clear himself was to be banished from the colony; a second offense carried a death penalty. The Pilgrims of New England held radical Protestant disapproval of Christmas. Christmas observance was outlawed in Boston in 1659. The ban by the Puritans was revoked in 1681 by an English appointed governor, however it was not until the mid-19th century that celebrating Christmas became common in the Boston region.\n Passage 3:In 1986, Talk Talk, then a three-piece band consisting of leader and singer Mark Hollis alongside drummer Lee Harris and bassist Paul Webb, released their third album The Colour of Spring, which saw the band shift from their earlier, synthpop-oriented sound and featured a more organic art rock sound, where musicians improvised with their instruments for many hours, then Hollis and producer Tim Friese-Greene edited and arranged the performances to get the sound they wanted. A total of sixteen musicians appeared on the album. It became their most successful album, selling over two million copies and prompting a major world tour. Nonetheless, for their next album Spirit of Eden (1988), the band chose to work towards an even more unconventional and uncommercial direction. The album was compiled from a lengthy recording process at London's Wessex Studios between 1987 and 1988 where the band worked again with Friese-Greene and engineer Phill Brown. Often working in darkness, the band recorded many hours of improvised performances which were heavily edited and re-arranged into the final album.\n", "output": "3", "category": "Question Answering 858.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a question, along with three passages, 1, 2, and 3.

Thaw, who was accused of murder. Thaw was the mentally unstable heir of a railroad baron, and he had killed a renowned architect, Stanford White, who had previously sexually assaulted Thaw's wife, Evelyn Nesbit, who was a famous fashion model and chorus girl. The trial was the subject of intense public interest and was highly sensationalized in the press, becoming one of the earliest examples of the \"trial of the century\" phenomenon. Fitzgerald ordered the jury to be sequestered, which was a highly unusual step at the time. In a contemporaneous report, the New York Times could only identify one specific previous case in which this had occurred. Fitzgerald had to declare a mistrial when the jury was unable to agree on a verdict. After a second trial in 1908 (under a different judge) ended with verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity and Thaw was incarcerated in a state hospital for the criminally insane but continued to pursue legal challenges to his incarceration, Fitzgerald suffered a nervous breakdown in 1911 that was attributed to the strain of the trial.\n Passage 2:On 3 March 1982, opposition politician and leader of the MLPC party, Ange-F\u00e9lix Patass\u00e9, returned from exile to the Central African Republic and staged an unsuccessful coup against General Andr\u00e9 Kolingba (who himself took power in the 1981 coup d'\u00e9tat) with the help of a few military officers, such as General Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9, who accused Kolingba of treason and proclaimed the change of power on Radio Bangui. Four days later, having failed to gain the support of the Central African Armed Forces, Patass\u00e9 went in disguise to the French Embassy in the Central African Republic to seek refuge. After heated negotiations between the Kolingba government and France, Patass\u00e9 was allowed to leave for exile in Togo. Boziz\u00e9 fled to the north of the country with 100 soldiers, before obtaining refuge in France.\n Passage 3:Lord Jersey married Lady Sarah Sophia Fane, daughter of John Fane, 10th Earl of Westmorland, on 23 May 1804. She was the eldest grandchild and heiress of Robert Child, principal shareholder of the banking firm Child & Co. Lord Jersey added the surname Child to the Villiers surname by royal licence in 1819. Lady Jersey was one of the great hostesses of English society, a leader of the ton during the Regency era and the reign of George IV, and a patroness of Almack's. Lord Jersey was an ardent fox hunter and a breeder and trainer of horses, owning two Epsom Derby winners, in Mameluke (1827) and Bay Middleton (1836) as well as other notable thoroughbreds such as Glencoe.

Passage 1:Walker's debut match for Derbyshire in the 1881 season was against Yorkshire when he never had the chance to bowl and scored 2 runs in each innings. He did not play again in that season nor in the 1882 season, and only played in two games in the 1883 season. In the 1884 and 1885 season, when William Cropper lead the bowling, he played more frequently and in 1885 took 7\u2013105 against Nottinghamshire in one match and 5\u201387 in the other. In 1886 Walker was selected for two Gentlemen of England teams, in one of which against Australia he was in the team with his hero W.G. Grace. For the county he took 6\u201326 against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), and 7\u201338 and 5\u201375 in the same match against Surrey. In the 1887 season Walker took 5\u201354 for Derbyshire against Lancashire and 5\u201349 against Surrey.

Grace in the side again although he never had the opportunity to bowl against him in any of his first-class games. He also took 5\u201324 for Derbyshire against Lancashire. In the 1896 season he took 9\u201385 against Leicestershire although his average was deteriorating. He played four games in the 1897 season and six in the 1898 season by which time his bowling made little impression, while Billy Bestwick was beginning to star.\n Passage 2:The 2008 Arizona Cardinals season was the 89th season for the team in the National Football League and their 21st season in Arizona. The season marked the Cardinals' first Super Bowl appearance, coming as a result of their victory against the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC Championship. The Cardinals slogan for the season was \"Shock The World!\" Riding the back of quarterback Kurt Warner, who had gone from being a backup for the St. Louis Rams in 1999 to leading the Greatest Show on Turf to a Super Bowl XXXIV victory, and franchise wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald, the Cardinals went on a playoff run for the ages after having won just one playoff game in the last sixty years, as Warner once again recreated the magic he had captured with the Rams. (Coincidentally, both teams were based in St Louis at one point or another, only to relocate to different cities.)\n Passage 3:Luther began by criticising the sale of indulgences, insisting that the Pope had no authority over purgatory and that the Treasury of Merit had no foundation in the Bible. The Reformation developed further to include a distinction between Law and Gospel, a complete reliance on Scripture as the only source of proper doctrine (sola scriptura) and the belief that faith in Jesus is the only way to receive God's pardon for sin (sola fide) rather than good works. Although this is generally considered a Protestant belief, a similar formulation was taught by Molinist and Jansenist Catholics. The priesthood of all believers downplayed the need for saints or priests to serve as mediators, and mandatory clerical celibacy was ended. Simul justus et peccator implied that although people could improve, no one could become good enough to earn forgiveness from God.

Lerdorf's family moved to Canada from Denmark in 1980, and later moved to King City, Ontario in 1983. He graduated from King City Secondary School in 1988, and in 1993 he graduated from the University of Waterloo with a Bachelor of Applied Science in Systems Design Engineering. He contributed to the Apache HTTP Server and he added the LIMIT clause to the mSQL DBMS. A variant of this LIMIT clause had already been around for a decade in mainframe relational database management systems (like Oracle Rdb running on VAX/VMS, formerly from Digital Equipment Corporation), but apparently it had not yet been picked up by the emerging PC-based databases.

The land that eventually became Wisconsin was transferred from British to American control with the 1783 signing of the Treaty of Paris. It was an unorganized part of the Northwest Territory until 1802 when all of the land from St. Louis north to the Canadian border was organized as St. Clair County. When Illinois was admitted to the union in 1818, Wisconsin became part of the Territory of Michigan and divided into two counties: Brown County in the northeast along Lake Michigan and Crawford County in the southwest along the Mississippi River. Iowa County was formed in 1829 from the Crawford County land south of the Wisconsin River. Brown County's southern portion was used to form Milwaukee County in 1834.

In January 1916, as a General Staff Officer (GSO), Elles was sent by General Sir Douglas Haig, the Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the BEF on the Western Front, to investigate the first tanks or \"caterpillars\" being built in England. He attended the first trials of \"Mother\" and reported back to Haig on its success. During the summer of 1916, he was tasked to report back from the Somme, where the tanks were first used. Elles was appointed to head the Heavy Branch (the first tank units) of the Machine Gun Corps in France on 29 September 1916, with the temporary rank of colonel.

He got his first job upon completing school with the Regina Leader-Post, but moved west to Edmonton, Alberta six months later. Upon moving to Edmonton, Matheson got a job with the Edmonton Journal in 1970. He initially covered local curling and university sports, but quickly switched to hockey, when, in 1973, Edmonton was granted a WHA franchise, the Edmonton Oilers. Matheson became the beat writer for the Oilers then, and continued when the Oilers joined the NHL in 1979. He spent countless hours covering the team and its five Stanley Cups, and completed more than 300 stories per winter. In addition to writing, Matheson also was a part of the CFRN radio broadcasting team that covered the Oilers. After 24 years, he completed his tenure as beat writer for the Oilers in 1997.

In 1857 he was promoted to major-general and chief of the Prussian Military Cabinet (the King's military advisers). He gave strong support to the Prince Regent's plans for the reorganization of the army. In 1861 he was violently attacked in a pamphlet by Karl Twesten (1820\u20131870), a Liberal leader, whom he had wounded in a duel, for which Manteuffel insisted on being briefly imprisoned. He was promoted to lieutenant-general for the coronation of William I on 18 October 1861 and saw active service in that rank in the Danish War of 1864, then at its conclusion was appointed civil and military governor of Schleswig. In the Austrian War of 1866 he first occupied Holstein and afterwards commanded a division under Vogel von Falkenstein in the Hanoverian campaign, then in July succeeded Vogel in command of the Army of the Main.\n Passage 3:Page attended the Okemos Montessori School (now called Montessori Radmoor) in Okemos, Michigan, from 1975 to 1979, and graduated from East Lansing High School in 1991.

In the 2005 UK general election, he stood against the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, in the Sedgefield constituency. Keys declared at the outset of the campaign that he had been a Labour Party voter and was still basically socialist, but that he was seeking election as a candidate opposed to Blair's policy on the Iraq War. He claimed that by electing him, voters could keep the Labour Party in power but with Gordon Brown as the likely Prime Minister rather than Blair. Former Independent MP Martin Bell urged the other parties to withdraw their candidates as removing a supporter of the war from office would send a message to President Bush and other World Leaders who had supported him. During the campaign, UK newspaper The Guardian's Stuart Jeffries asked Keys, \"Is it difficult to be a political candidate in these circumstances, when you are still clearly grieving?\", to which he replied \"Yes it is. [\u2026] I feel, though, that I have a responsibility to Tom. I keep going back to the words of a widow of a man who died on the Kursk [\u2026].

Passage 1:Yosef Dayan emigrated to Israel in 1968, and became a member of the right-wing Kach movement. Dayan is the founder of \"Malchut Israel\", a right-wing religious-political group in Israel advocating a return of the monarchy. In 2004, he became a member of the newly reconstituted Sanhedrin, a duplicate of the religious tribunal which convened during the time of the Second Temple, a group that had traditionally had seventy-one members. He has also achieved certain notoriety for his alleged central participation in so-called \"death curse\" ceremonies or Pulsa diNura aimed at Yitzhak Rabin and Ariel Sharon. These curses were presumably to request divine retribution after those former Prime Ministers advocated Israeli withdrawal from certain areas considered by some as inalienable parts of the promised land. Incidentally, Yitzhak Rabin was murdered soon after the first curse, and Ariel Sharon left in a persistent vegetative state after a brain haemorrhage following the second. He is also known to have supported Baruch Goldstein's (a fellow Meir Kahane disciple) terrorist actions in the Cave of the Patriarch's Massacre.\n Passage 2:A distinction is often made between the island of New Guinea and what is known as Island Melanesia, which consists of \"the chain of archipelagos, islands, atolls, and reefs forming the outer bounds of the sheltered oval-shaped coral sea\". This includes the Louisiade archipelago (part of Papua New Guinea), the Bismarck Archipelago (part of Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands), and the Santa Cruz Islands (part of the country called Solomon Islands).

This new wing included two new anchors, Famous-Barr and Venture. The renovation also brought a food court as well as a new 5 screen cinema. In 1994, Heer's closed, and Famous-Barr moved its men's wear and home goods to the former Heer's space. That same year Sears built a store adjacent to Montgomery Ward, moving from an older store near downtown Joplin. In 1998 the mall received a minor renovation, changing only the color scheme. After the closure of the Venture chain in 1998, its anchor at the mall was converted to Shopko, but it closed in the early 2000s following the closure of Montgomery Ward in 2001. Both Famous-Barr locations were re-branded as Macy's in 2006. Montgomery Ward remained vacant until mid-2007, when its space was split between TJ Maxx and Steve & Barry's, the latter of which closed in 2008 and was replaced by Vintage Stock.

She is thus a niece of Winston Churchill, who was Prime Minister during the Second World War, and a granddaughter of Lord Randolph Churchill, Chancellor of the Exchequer 1886\u201387, and his wife the American society beauty Jennie Jerome. Her paternal great-grandfather was the 7th Duke of Marlborough, and her maternal great-great-grandfather the 3rd Marquess of Londonderry, half-brother of the 2nd Marquess, who, as Viscount Castlereagh was Foreign Secretary during the Congress of Vienna of 1815 that followed the Napoleonic Wars.\n Passage 2:MCA embarked on a big marketing campaign to tout Willis after she recorded her first album on the label, the 1990 album Well Travelled Love. MCA ensured that Willis was interviewed by several national magazines including unusual venues like Vogue and Mademoiselle. Her voice appeared in the 1991 Ridley Scott-produced movie Thelma and Louise, singing \"Little Honey.\" Willis also had a small part in Tim Robbins\u2019 1992 film Bob Roberts.

She was also nominated for Top New Female Vocalist of the year at the 1993 ACM Awards along with Faith Hill and Lari White (Hill wound up winning the award). Despite of all the publicity and positive reviews from most reviewers, Well Travelled Love and Willis\u2019s subsequent albums for MCA (Bang Bang in 1991 and Kelly Willis in 1993) sold modestly and received very little radio play. During this time, Willis felt uncomfortable with the way she was marketed by MCA. In 1994, MCA released Willis from her contract.\n Passage 3:On its way back to Macedonia, the funerary cart with Alexander's body was met in Syria by one of Alexander's generals, the future ruler Ptolemy I Soter. In late 322 or early 321 BC Ptolemy diverted the body to Egypt where it was interred in Memphis, Egypt. In the late 4th or early 3rd century BC Alexander's body was transferred from the Memphis tomb to Alexandria for reburial (by Ptolemy Philadelphus in c. 280 BC, according to Pausanias). Later Ptolemy Philopator placed Alexander's body in Alexandria's communal mausoleum. Shortly after the death of Cleopatra, Alexander's resting place was visited by Augustus, who is said to have placed flowers on the tomb and a golden diadem upon Alexander's head. By the 4th century AD the resting place of Alexander was no longer known; later authors, such as Ibn 'Abd al-Hakam, Al-Masudi and Leo the African, report having seen Alexander's tomb. Leo the African in 1491 and George Sandys in 1611 reportedly saw the tomb in Alexandria.

Suda wanted to make a survival horror game exclusively for the PlayStation 3. With his first horror title  receiving decent sales in Japan by 2006, Suda immediately began working on Kurayami (Japanese for 'Darkness') in his spare time. It was at one time thought to be called \"Closer\". However, EA later confirmed that name had been abandoned for another title. By the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in 2006, a publisher for Kurayami had not yet been established. In 2008, Suda presented the game's concept to EA Games, who agreed to license the Unreal Engine 3 and to publish the game to a worldwide audience. Shinji Mikami was then invited to executive-produce the project. Suda wanted to announce the game at E3 2009, but was not allowed to do so, due to a media silence agreement between Grasshopper Manufacture and EA Games. That December, Akira Yamaoka (sound designer for the Silent Hill series) left Konami after finishing his work on  and joined Grasshopper Manufacture because he enjoyed the latter's game No More Heroes.

Passage 1:The Lebanese Christians are some of the oldest Christians in the world, preceded only by the oriental Orthodox of Armenia and Copts of Egypt. The Maronite Christians, belong to the West Syriac Rite. Their Liturgical language is the Syriac-Aramaic language. The Melkite Greek Catholics and the Greek Orthodox, tend to focus more on the Greco-Hellenistic heritage of the region from the days of the Byzantine Empire, and the fact that Greek was maintained as a liturgical language until very recently. Some Lebanese even claim partial descent from Crusader knights who ruled Lebanon for a couple of centuries during the Middle Ages, also backed by recent genetic studies which confirmed this among Lebanese people, especially in the north of the country that was under the Crusader County of Tripoli. This identification with non-Arab civilizations also exists in other religious communities, albeit not to the same extent.\n Passage 2:Former Black Sabbath members vocalist Ronnie James Dio and drummer Vinny Appice formed Dio in October 1982 in the United States with bassist Jimmy Bain and guitarist Vivian Campbell. The band released their debut album, Holy Diver in May 1983. Since Ronnie James Dio and Jimmy Bain had played keyboards on the record, they recruited keyboardist Claude Schnell for live shows in 1983 and the following Holy Diver tour. Claude Schnell would later become a full member of Dio, and the band's first recorded effort as a quintet would be 1984's The Last in Line. The band proceeded to release Sacred Heart in 1985 and The Dio E.P. in 1986 before Campbell was fired from the band.

At Arlington cemetery, the number of people attending the annual event swiftly overwhelmed the limited facilities. The first Decoration Day event was held in front of Arlington House. James A. Garfield, a former Major General in the Union Army (and future President of the United States), addressed a \"large crowd\" from the mansion's back steps. The following year, President Ulysses S. Grant closed the federal government for the holiday, and most businesses followed, which greatly contributed to attendance at the cemetery. A dais seating 400 people was erected in what remained of \"the Grove\" at the rear of Arlington House to accommodate speakers and dignitaries\u2014which, for the first time, included President Grant. The Civil War Unknowns Monument, which was located south-southwest of Arlington House, was covered by a canopy. Several American flags hung from the canopy, red-white-and-blue bunting was draped along the monument's top, and numerous floral tributes were laid against it. An estimated 25,000 people attended the event throughout the day. Two sites for ceremonies were used in 1870. A very large speakers' dais was erected near the Sheridan Gate and McClellan Gate on the cemetery's east side, and used for speeches throughout the day. For the more important speakers, a second dais seating 200 was erected at the rear of Arlington House (although not with \"the Grove\"). A stand, permitting the seating of 500, was built nearby for a grand chorus (which sang for the crowd). Again, the Civil War Unknowns Monument was canopied and decorated. About 20,000 people attended the event that year, with rain keeping the numbers low. In 1871, the speakers' dais moved back to \"the Grove\" and expanded to accommodate 300 people. Frederick Douglass, the former African American slave and abolitionist, was the featured speaker that year. \"Hundreds\" of people attended his address, including President Grant. The dais moved again in 1872, this time to a location a few yards to the south of the Civil War Unknowns Monument. The dais was slightly reduced in size so that it only sat 200, but it now included a thrust on which stood a speaker's podium.
