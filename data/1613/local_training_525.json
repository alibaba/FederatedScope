These operations have some advantages over conventional cervicotomy in terms of postoperative pain and cosmetic results. Until now, there is no evidence to state that morbidity of these new approaches is at least equal to the conventional equivalent.

There are now numerous studies attesting to the good results of BoNTA in neuropathic detrusor overactivity; however, only scarce reports comment on the specific features of the disease process among patients and reasons for failure in some. In our study, reviewing the urodynamic findings carefully, it was observed that the patients who did not respond to injections were the ones with no contractions, despite high pressures and low compliance. Therefore, describing the indications of BoNTA as neuropathic detrusor overactivity and urinary incontinence despite anticholinergic medications may lead to mistreatment of patients in the decompensated phase of a hyper-reflexive detrusor.

The findings may help to do justice to the capacities children possess and challenges they may face when deciding about treatment and research options. We discuss advantages and drawbacks of standardized competence assessment in children on a case-by-case basis compared to application of a fixed age limit, and conclude that a selective implementation of case-by-case competence assessment in specific populations is preferable. We recommend the implementation of age limits based on empirical evidence. Furthermore, we elaborate on a suitable model for informed consent involving children and parents that would do justice to developmental aspects of children and the specific characteristics of the parent-child dyad. Previous research outcomes showed that children's medical decision-making capacities could be operationalized into a standardized assessment instrument. Recommendations for policies include a dual consent procedure, including both child as well as parents, for children from the age of 12 until they reach majority. For children between 10 and 12 years of age, and in case of children older than 12 years in special research populations of mentally compromised patients, we suggest a case-by-case assessment of children's competence to consent. Since such a dual consent procedure is fundamentally different from a procedure of parental permission and child assent, and would imply a considerable shift regarding some current legislations, practical implications are elaborated.", "output": "yes", "category": "Answer Verification 1470.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a passage with a question and an answer to that question, classify if the answer actually answers the question into 'yes' or 'no'.

This suggests that hippocampal microglia activation, in the presence of A\u03b21-42 in excess, produces neurotoxic and oligodendrotoxic oligomers that, through WM tract damage, spread disease to neighboring and connected areas, causing local microglia activation and propagation of disease through the same sequence of events.
