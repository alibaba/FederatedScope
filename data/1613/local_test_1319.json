Someone throws a rock through the window and Lamar (the man in the backwards ball cap) taunts one of the bikers, \"you sorry yet motherfucker? I told your cracker ass, bitch ass...\" and before he finishes he's pistol whipped and shot.   Rust immediately realizes the situation is heading south a lot faster than he had anticipated. Another biker smashes another window with his shotgun and begins to fire on the other gang members assembled outside. Rust somehow senses a shot is coming and ducks into the corner right before a bullet comes through the wall.   My question is, how did he know the shot was coming right there? Is there someone aiming a gun out of focus that we can't see or was he just playing it safe and ended up being right?", "output": "How did Rust know the shot was coming right there in True Detective S1E4?", "category": "Question Generation 734.json"}, {"instruction": "Given scene/plot descriptions from movies or TV shows, and given a specific question about the scene, summarize the question into a title", "input": "This happened towards the end of Series 5 of Breaking Bad.  Hank had just been killed; Walt was on the run and the police were trying to track him down; Skyler was under investigation by the police for suspected involvement with Walt's schemes.   But one night masked men (who we know to be Jack's men) managed to break into Skyler's home and threaten her.  The police witnessed an angry tirade over the phone from Walt to Skyler and were aware how dangerous he was. I believe we even see that Marie's house was protected by armed-guards at the time. So why did the police not protect Skyler's home? And, if they did, how did the break-in occur?", "output": "In Breaking Bad how did the masked men break into Skyler's home?", "category": "Question Generation 734.json"}, {"instruction": "Given scene/plot descriptions from movies or TV shows, and given a specific question about the scene, summarize the question into a title", "input": "Early in the movie Skyfall, when Bond is presumed dead, he is shown drinking at a bar and being cheered on by a large group of spectators as he attempts to down a drink with a live scorpion on his hand. Immediately as this scene ends, Bond is shown at the same bar, but the bar is now empty except for the bartender.  When I originally saw the movie, I thought the quick cut was meant to show that it was the next day, and that Bond had spent the entire night at the bar. However, I have seen some speculate that the first scene was merely a daydream - Bond imagining how he would like his life to be, when in reality he spends his time drinking alone in the middle of the day.  Could someone explain whether it was a daydream or not?", "output": "In Skyfall, was the bar scene a daydream or was it real?", "category": "Question Generation 734.json"}, {"instruction": "Given scene/plot descriptions from movies or TV shows, and given a specific question about the scene, summarize the question into a title", "input": "Was Galaxy Quest just a parody of Star Trek and related Sci-Fi tropes or were the lead characters in Galaxy Quest poking fun at certain actors in particular as well?
