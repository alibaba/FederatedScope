Add celery (finely chopped) and carrots. Add garlic (I use the jar minced kind - or you can mince your own) and stir well. Sprinkle veggies with flour and cook for about 3 minutes. Add tomato paste, beef stock, and wine. Stir well. Place 3 whole springs of rosemary in mix. Add the cooked beef and all the juices back to the pot and bring to a boil.

Then add potatoes to the stew and simmer for an hour or so longer, until potatoes are very tender. Be sure to stir fairly often, scraping edges and bottom of the pot.
