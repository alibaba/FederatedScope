I was initially sceptical of the Stone Roses and for a long time I never really gave them a chance. However after numerous recommendations i finally decided to giv ethis album a go and found (to my surprise)  uplifting and repetitivly entertaining album.    From the opening of I Wanna Be Adored to Waterfall to Bye Bye Badman to I Am The Ressurection and the bonus track on this disc Fool's Gold. What most impresses me about this album is it's ability to not only keep your intention for 10 minutes plus (Both Fool's Gold and I Am The Ressurection push double figures) and still leave you yearning for more like The Velvet Underground's I'm Waiting For The Man you could just keep listening for hours.

What they said was that Katy can't rock just yet because she's a raw talent and not yet coherent in theme.  I saw her live on the Chicks with Attitude tour with Liz Phair and the Cardigans and Charlotte Martin and Rose was the worst performer of the night.  The first problem is that her voice just isn't that strong, secondly, her lyrics never come out as if they're honest and as if they are always a pretension that people feel a cool girl growing up should say.  Throughout her set, there was only one song that stuck out as an interesting and unique thing (passingly honest as well) and that was \"Snowflake.\"  It's fitting that the song was preceded by an ironic intro about how she's lived in California for a long time, but she hates warm weather, sounds impossible, but she must be truthful because it's the only song that breaks out of the leaden grunge guitar mix and hits the audience over the head with songcraft.  I'm sure she has potential for the future, but I think on her next album she should take a hint from Beth Orton who's known previous to her most recent album for being a popular artist in the realm of trip hop.

This 1972 soundtrack for the Barbet Schroeder film \"La Vallee\" was recorded during two, one-week sessions, between which a tour of Japan was sandwiched.  Interestingly, the album works as a cohesive whole, in spite of the short recording time, and the \"dry\" production (especially on Nick Mason's drums) lends the album a very tight feel.  It has been written that Obscured by Clouds is the last true group effort and I pretty much agree.  The album also finds the band poised on the cusp of massive, global superstardom, which would become fully realized with the mega-smash, mega-million selling album The Dark Side of the Moon (1973).    Lyrically, Roger Waters begins to reflect on issues that he would develop further, including his war-victim father (Free Four) and Dave Gilmour refers to science fiction with Childhoods End, which is the title of Arthur C. Clarke's classic from the genre.  I guess it is worth noting that Childhood's End was recorded without the final verse and that Roger would write all lyrics for the group following this album, thus \"relieving\" Dave of this responsibility.  Dave's vocals are also excellent and he really comes across as a confident singer.  His guitar playing is also in top flight too.  In addition to tracks with lyrics, there are quite a few instrumentals as well.    Musically, I think Pink Floyd was in fine form on this album.  My favorite cuts include the atmospheric, VCS3 synthesizer heavy instrumental tracks Obscured by Clouds, Mudmen, and Absolutely Curtains (loads of Rick Wright's sustained Hammond organ), along with the heavy instrumental When You're In.  Burning Bridges, Wot's...uh the Deal, and Stay are also superb and feature the trademark drifting and spacey Floyd sound.  At the opposite end of the spectrum is the thunderous The Gold It's in the..., which reminds me somewhat of the bone-crushing Nile Song (from More, 1969).  Free Four is the only bouncy and lighthearted track on the album, which stands in stark contrast with Water's dark subject matter - the ruminations of someone on their deathbed.    With respect to this 1994 remaster it is just OK and features good sound quality, images from the film, and all lyrics.    All in all, this excellent album is a personal favorite and is very highly recommended along with Atom Heart Mother (1970), Meddle (1971), Wish You Were Here (1975), and Animals (1977).", "output": "POS", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1105.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given music product reviews in English language.

'Magical Mystery Tour' is the most uneven of all the Beatles' albums.  The familiar songs are magnificent, but while some of the originals are poor, they are always interesting.  The American record company did a cut-and-paste on all of the Beatles' albums up to 'Sgt. Pepper', and, while it was to their great detriment, their intervention here was a masterstroke.  Because EP's (extended plays, records with five to seven songs, like a half-album) are part and parcel of the UK and not the U.S., this c.d. contains a jackpot of the Beatles' accomplished singles of '67.  Without them there wouldn't be a full album as we know it. Significantly, it was the only time the British record company later complied to the US format.    To start, the title track is a fun, carnival anthem.  It is looser and less serious than 'Sgt. Pepper'.  Then, Paul, subjectively matches himself with the perceptive and beautiful \"Fool on the Hill,\" with its admonitions from yet another memorable character, meant to look at the conventional world differently at the expense of alienation.  However, it is John's \"I am the Walrus\" that pours out surreal imagery (yet borrows a few references from Lewis Carroll) that is the album's highlight.  From there the original songs are interesting, but substandard.  \"Flying\" makes an interesting instrumental with vocals added without any discernible words, but it seems more like an exercise than a good song.  Much in this vein, \"Your Mother Should Know,\" is a shadow of Paul's best vaudevillian efforts, including \"When I'm Sixty Four\" and \"Honey Pie\".  The echoing vocal effects don't do anything to contribute to the song, either.  Also, George contributes what may be his poorest Beatles' song, \"Blue Jay Way\".  While it is understandable that spiritual awakening is the heart of all major religions, this song is done with unremarkable lyrics and sung with effects that make it sound like he's a deep sea diver accompanied by drowzy cello patterns.    The remarkable second half almost needs no elaboration.  \"Hello/Goodbye\" heralds the second half with one of their catchiest songs.  \"Penny Lane\" and \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" made what many believe to be one of the best singles ever.  The former is glorious and the latter is Lennon at his philosophical best.  \"All You Need Is Love\" may seem somewhat dated, but it needs a revival (and not just in credit card commercials!)  It is still a remarkable and entertaining anthem and subjectively one of the Beatles' very best songs.  \"Baby You're a Rich Man,\" the song's B-side is no throw-away, either.  Clever and funny, like Lennon, it is a catchy and mesmerizing piece.    Song for song, 'Magical Mystery Tour' is still essential.  It represents their most uneven effort, but retains some of their best music. Either way it always remains interesting.", "output": "POS", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1105.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given music product reviews in English language.

Ok, I got this CD about year ago or something, and never got the chance to write a review about it. She is a really good singer, and that's really good for a girl at such a young age. The first song I ever heard by her was \"Leave (get out)\" and I liked it a little bit then, but now I really like it! She may be a little too young to sing what she sings about, but the songs are still really good! Well, here it is:    1. Breezy - 10/10 A really interesting and creative beginning to the album! She uses loud vocals in this song, too, which makes it stand out a lot.    2. Baby it's you - 10/10 A great single! This song is very sweet, and is pretty easy to understand in some parts.    3. Not that kinda girl - 10/10 This is one of her latest singles on her CD, and it's a very nice song! In this song she basically talks about what she is and what she isn't, and I really like music that does that sort of stuff.    4. The happy song - 8/10 This one is ok, but not my favorite. The tune is a little too orignal in my opinion, but the lyrics are pretty good.    5. Homeboy - 10/10 Great song, although I never really liked the word \"homeboy\". But, the tune is very familiar and very pretty.    6. City lights - 7.5/10 This one isn't that great, particularly because of the guys that come up some point in this song and start to rap. It just sounds a little werid, and I never liked rap.    7. Leave (Get out) - 10/10 Awesome single! It's one of the only songs on here that stands out, and it's great to dance to! The music video is pretty cool too, check it out!    8. Use my shoulder - 7/10 Ok, I think she could've picked a better chorus tune than this one, cuz this one was just annoying and boring. But as always, the lyrics are good.    9. Never say goodbye - 10/10 Beautiful! This tune is VERY familiar! It sounds to me like she did a remake of it or something, cuz it's got a beautiful tune and beautiful lyrics. This song can also be used as a lullaby to put someone to sleep. :-P    10. Weak - 6/10 UGH! This song is just soooooooo long and boring! Although the lyrics are always good, this song is just too original.    11. Keep on Keepin' on - 9/10 This is the first song on this ablum that's written by JoJo herself! She did a great job on it, too. The lyrics are just so true!    12. Sunshine - 9/10 Another song that she wrote, and it's just as good. I like the tune also, it's very nice.    13. Yes or no - 9/10 This is a good one too, and another one that she wrote (along with others, of course). I really like the beginning, it's one of those beginnings you would'nt expect in a song lol.    14. Fairy Tales - 7/10 I guess this is a nice ending, but the song itself isn't too great. I'm sure she could've made a better tune than this boring one. I'm into pop and energetic music, not usually slow songs like this!    Overall, cool CD. If you've heard any of JoJo's music, I'm sure you'd like her album. Also, keep and eye out for her new album titled \"The high road\" coming out on October 17th!

I'll state the obvious. Rich Boy's southern twang is so thick that its hard to understand what he is saying sometimes. This album has more bad tracks than good tracks so let me focus on the good then the bad. Standout Tracks: Throw Some Ds is a catchy first single that I didnt like at first and the remix with Andre 3000(he had the best verse on here), Nelly, Murphy Lee, The Game is a lot better than the original. Boy Looka Here is an alright second single plus I like how the beat breaks down. And I Love You had potential to be a great track till Pastor Troy delivers a crappy verse on it but Big Boi held it down on here. Lost Girls and Ghetto Rich(featuring John Legend) are two tracks that are worth hearing plus any song of substance I'll give credit for. Filler: Rich Boy pulls a Rick Ross and has way too many chick songs on here like What It Do, Good Things, Touch That A**(the worst out of all of them) and On The Regular. Role Models is weak and so is the fillerific Hustla Balla Gangsta Mack and Gangsta. Get To Poppin has to be the worst plus I've heard Pitbull spit over that same horrible beat(and that track sucked too). Bottom Line: 6 good songs are a good enough reason to skip this album.

There are several questions I have after listening to this CD.    Why are the tempos so crazy?  The opening number plods along like a funeral march, while At The Ballet zips past as if the performers are on crank.  Part of me suspects that cast is performing against a pre-recorded accompaniment track.    Why does everything sound so thin?  These orchestrations were created to achieve maximum resonance in live acoustic settings.  On this CD, it's like every single instrument is separately mic'ed and mixed to within an inch of its life, sometimes to the detriment of the overall sound.  Sometimes, obviously live instruments sound like MIDI.  Usually it's the sound engineer's job to make the opposite happen!    Why are the vocals so \"hot\"?  In the OBC, there were occasions when the entire chorus would get overwhelmed by reverb and full-sounding orchestra.  Now it's the vocals that tear at the balance.    Who cast this show?  I'm not going to single any one cast member out because it would rude, but -- oh screw it.  You deserve to know.  This Cassie is some serious vocal ugly.  I didn't once wonder along with Zach why she was stuck auditioning on the line, like I did with Ms. Donna McKechnie's fabulous triple threat.    Why not update some of the orchestrations?  I have a deep and abiding respect for Jonathan Tunick (who is among my top three favorite Broadway creative types), but it's 2006.  Wah wah pedals are out.    Overall, although this CD is good for completists, it's not going to knock the OBC recording out of it's slot as the definitive A CHORUS LINE recording.  If you don't have a Chorus Line CD and are trying to decide which one to buy, track down the re-mastered version of the original broadway cast.

This early Elton John effort is an example of when John and Taupin had some edge and grit to their songs with some western influence. The whole album seems interconnected with excellent music, vocals and words that bond to one of their greatest collaborations. \"Rocket Man\" was the big hit during the albums original debut but the many of the other songs were virtually bigger in quality and longevity. \"Honky Cat\" starts with a smart jazzy sound with Elton in a cocky voice talking about his \"redneck ways\" that jumps and hops but in the next song he steps down and eases into the song \"Mellow\", which slows up to a laid back story of love behind close doors with a lover that makes him sing in a tired but pleased voice \"You make me mellow, oh you make me mellow\" and the song does make you ease into feeling the mellow he sings about. I like the sound and lyrics of all the songs but the oddly up tempo song about a typical teenager being morose in \"I think I am going to Kill Myself\" is spritely entertaining sound of a youth complaining about small transgressions like not using the car then he downshifts suddenly  down in a lyrical sound into a slowing middle eight of \"Get a little headline news, I'd like to see what the papers say, On the state of teenage blues\", particularly when Elton soulfully extends the word blues into a long bluesy wail that just puts this song in a unique category. Salvation is an almost gospel sounding song that starts off slow with \"I have to say my friends, this road goes a long, long way\" with great guitars and backing harmonies that is virtually uplifting in a sound that is optimistic in spite of the challenges exposed in the lyrics. \"Amy\" is just a fun tune that sounds like a young man teased by a wild and more mature woman and he sings with pain and but with optimism in his voice \"Amy I may not be James Dean, Amy I may not be nineteen, And I may still be in romper boots and jeans, But Amy you're the girl that wrecks my dreams\". One of the ultimate classics is \"Mona Lisa\" an up lifting song about a tough life in NY city that crosses the dimensions of different type of people, the poor and the affluent as Elton mournfully sings \"Until you've seen this trash can dream come true, You stand at the edge while people run you through, And I thank the Lord there's people out there like you, I thank the Lord there's people out there like you\" that in the end is uplifting, that he has found something and someone in a tough time and place. Finishing with a flourish, \"Hercules\" is a rollicking tune about being in love with a woman who is unfortunately in love with a muscleman, a \"cat named Hercules\".  The song has John with an excellent vocal with backing vocals with a touch of beach boys' sound and although the song seems to end in defeat, it sounds like the man will persevere with a touch of humor. \"Rocket Man\" is the classic song that Elton used to sing for 20 minutes in concert and it is a great song about a man being a long way from home in a cold desolate environment but the whole album is full of great songs and perhaps this is the best John/Taupin collaboration. The additional alternate version of the western sounding \"Slave\" is more up tempo than the original and is very good but the core 10 songs are just wonderful and always memorable.", "output": "POS", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1105.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given music product reviews in English language.

The fact that it will remain under almost everyone's radar is not entirely bad, as it leaves it open for discovery many, many years down the road", "output": "POS", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1105.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given music product reviews in English language.

This is the first Branford I heard (back in 1990) and I've heard a lot of him since.  I sometimes find his stuff hard to get into, but his sound is so pure and the music so honest and driving that I keep coming back to it.  Also, and this is definitely worth mentioning, his band is hot and Jeff &quot;Tain&quot; Watts is an astonishing drummer.  In any event, Contemporary Jazz, The Dark Keys, Bloomington, The Beautyful Ones, and especially the recent Footsteps of our Fathers are all quite stunning albums, but they require comfort with free and intense music.  If you already dig 60's Coltrane and Ornette, go for it.  If not, and you want to jump in and hear why people think Branford is so good, Crazy People Music is a great place to start.  You get the fiery intensity of the later albums, but the tracks are easier to digest and the melodicism of the themes (and the solos) is more accessible to those less familiar with his style.  I wouldn't start any earlier in his career, because you get his more &quot;bop&quot; influenced style, which he has evolved past (though he still has that sweet tone).  Trio Jeepy is another place to start, but I think it too, though a fine album, doesn't give a complete sense of his mature sound.  I gave this four stars, because it's not his most amazing work, but I do love it and have come back to it regularly over the last twelve years.  If this gets its hooks in you, you'll like the later albums; if this sounds overwhelming and, well, crazy, you'll probably find the later albums only more so", "output": "POS", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1105.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given music product reviews in English language.

Please...(2.5 stars) . A lot of people are meriting Ja's credibility on all his albums because he has been able to keep his voice on the airwaves since 1998. So he released his sophomore album Rule 3:36 in Sept 2000, that is one of the worst Ja albums I've heard (not the worst, The Last Temptation takes that title).     Ja tries to be \"gangstafied\" on this album but fails terribly. Starting with the first single \"Me & You\" thinking his thug style can attract women. I haven't bought the concept in 2000, and I'm still not buying it six years later. Or how about the flat falling track \"F*** You\" featuring Vita and 01?    Or as many revewers have pointed out that he tries to boast his singing vocals on this album, which seriously damages his creditablity. How about the song \"Put It On Me\" before Lil Mo joined song. Sounds wack(er) with out her. Or how about the late Barry White imitation on the song \"Extacy\" (and thats one of the decent tracks on this album). Oh and remember when \"Between Me & You\" was highly antacipated that you downloaded the single on Napster? Well do you remember that the origonal/demo that some of you downloaded didn't have Christina Millian singing the hook, but had Ja singing it himself. Thank god that wasn't on the album.      Now there are some listenable tracks on this album that I would like to point out. \"6 Feet\" is a standout track, and is possibly the best track on this album and my personal favorite. \"Watching Me\" is another tight track, as Ja spits with a load of energy within him. \"I Cry\" and as mentioned earlier \"Extacy\" are decent at best. Other than that, most of the tracks on this album are skippable.    Overall, a sub medicore Ja Rule album. Most of the 4 and 5 star reviewers are either big time Ja Rule fans or just in love with mainstream overrated rap (\"Put It On Me\" [Remix]). To me, this album is nothing else but a pop rap, falsafied thug rap album that just doesn't appeal to me. I recommend this to hardcore Ja Rule fans if they don't have this already.

Jim Messina has played in a some great bands. He played in the Buffalo Springfield, a group of young legends.  He also played in Poco, probably the most under-appreciated and under-rated band of the era.  With these credentials, you can put Messina's name up there with the likes of Stills, Furay, Young, Nash, Crosby, Frey and Browne.  Then he teams up with Kenny Loggins, and things get bad.    I picked up this album, expecting greatness from these two, and I simply didn't find it.  What I found was two decent tunes surrounded by silly and annoying pop.  Most songs on here have simple lyrics, and are over-produced.    I do like two songs on here.  \"Till The Ends Meet\" is a nice, easy tune, and Loggins sounds very nice on this one.  The other song I like is \"Angry Eyes.\" The intro is very cool, and the singing interplay between Loggins and Messina is fun and interesting here.    The main point here is that this album does not live up to expectation in the least.  There's no folk, no country rock, no free and easy feeling to this one.  This is blatant pop-music.  If you like bouncy pop, this might be for you.

I first heard this song last summer while I was painting our house. Out in the fresh air and the sun (and recently wed), this song immediately caught my attention and only seemed to get more irrestible with every listen.

He manages to keep it romantic and unique instead of just making it a another decent rock song. I've also heard Chad's version from the album; while Chad's vocals are actually not *that* much different from Alex's (both manage to be very masculine and strong), I feel that the version with Chad is a \"good\" song while Alex's delivery makes it a \"great\" song. While Chad's voice is great for other songs, for this type of song it is overly domineering and angry-sounding. From a woman's perspective, Alex's way would manage to convince me to \"get together\" while Chad's would scare me off! Sometimes, one vocalist is just \"meant\" to sing a song and either make it or break it. Think of \"Smooth\" from 1999. Rob Thomas' delivery helped to make that song the hit it was.

The first time I heard about Antony and the Johnsons was from a friend of mine that told me about Rufus Wainwright and was listening to a new artist that was quite incredible.  I decided to do some investigating about this Antony at a local Barnes & Noble and what I discovered was very, very dissapointing.    I find the music to be well written instrumentally and layered quite well, but Antony's voice is very over the top and fake.  By fake, I mean his use of vibrato, which is very rapid and used in a way that comes out as forced and sheeplike (not natural).  Professional voice instructors teach that the correct way to use vibrato is at the right speed: five to six vibrations per second.  It is evident that Antony's \"trained\" sounding voice is not trained at all in this realm.    Another thing about this band and record that I find very horrible is the lyrics to the songs.  The artist seems confused or regretful of his own gender using a sorrowful and painful delivery of these wailings.  The lyrics hold no attraction or relation to the listening, which lends the listener to a pitiful and almost annoying view of the music itself because of this.

I have no idea what people are thinking here. This is one of Wendy and Lisa's strongest albums aside from Eroica. Maybe people just aren't into listening to Lisa sing, since she does most of the vocals for this album. However, I am a huge fan of Lisa, and any time I can get the opportunity to hear her sing, I cherish it. I think she has a marvelous and very sweet voice.      Some people have cited their first album was much stronger, but I disagree. The first album was way to &quot;pop-ish&quot; for my tastes, and they hadn't really come into their own yet. It just didn't have the depth of Eroica or Girl Bros.

He put it off for six years and then sucked the life out of it when he finally finished it and gave it back to them, rendering it a completely unplayable piece. (Lisa said it sounded like &quot;an Italian coffee table&quot; after he got through with it.) They didn't just throw that track in to be trendy or something, you know. If you're going to do a review, at least get your history and your facts straight. For the record, I like the hidden track, with its &quot;delta blues&quot; sound, and the lyrics are pretty scathing.       So anyway, don't listen to these other yahoos here saying that GB isn't all that good. They're wrong. Girl bros is a GREAT album. Definitely one of their top ones.

Mid Eighties SST indie rock classic! This was the very first Sonic Youth album I owned. I got the vinyl in 87 at the age of 15 and it blew my mind and has ever since! The best song on the album in my opinion, and one of Sonic Youth's best songs period is \"Expressway to yr Skull,\" aka \"Madonna, Sean and Me,\" aka  \"The crucifixion of Sean Penn.\" Whatever title you prefer, this song is a beautiful, powerful masterpiece that hits you in the soul every time. It's the most special melodic guitar masterpiece I have ever heard. Chiming scree infused with bliss, It builds to a mind melting crescendo and goes completely over the top, then the way the bass, drums and guitar work together into the mind bending recovery is aural art for sure. If you are lucky enough to hear it live you are in for a religous experience. On the vinyl it ended side 2 with a locked groove, meaning that when your turntable needle reached the end of the song instead of running out and ending it went around in a circle, playing the droning end of the song forever or until you turn it off.   While \"Expressway\" is a highlight, the rest of the album is awesome as well. Lyrically and sonically one of the things the sonics were into at the time this was recorded was the psychology and mythos surrounding the manson family and that era,  but that is only one aspect of this album. Another interesting thing about this album is the atmosphere it creates; many of the songs are different from one another sonically, yet the album is cohesive. Songs like \"In the Kingdom #19,\" with its narrative style and crazy stuff going on in the background evoking thoughts of D.Boon's tragic death, and \"Marilyn Moore,\" and \"Shadow of a Doubt\" just transport you atmospherically. I have recommended this album to many new listeners of SY, some find that they don't like it as much as \"Sister\" at first, because many of the songs aren't as \"immediately accessible\" as the gems of that album,  but with more listens it rewards them, it grows on them and they like it as much or more. Bublegum is a cover, I believe of an old Kim Fowley song and was not on the original release, but was a B-side (of the Starpower single if I remember correctly) added in the CD age. It seems somewhat out of place, especially following expressway. In any event, this recording is one of SY's best, and in my opinion one of the best period.

I guess \"Bible of Dreams\", Juno Reactor's bold foray into territory beyond their techno days, contains the best sounds. Aw, who am I kidding? It's the greatest album in the history of the universe!!!    1) Jardin de Cecile - 4/5. You might call it boring; I call it moody. This is not the standard \"calm & slow\" sound of Juno Reactor--in other words, it's not a droning, monotonous pile of neverending bull. This one actually has character, which is maybe not as evident in the first couple of minutes as it is later. We get some atmospheric, echoing notes that have a nice, dreamy quality to them. After a while, percussion joins in, along with this weird \"sweeping\" noise that pops in every few seconds. About five minutes in, the song undergoes a complete change of style and transforms to heavy percussion and a little synth. A nice intro that gives you a taste of things to come. It's like the POV of someone gradually waking up and joining the traffic jam of everyday life. While stoned.    2) Conga Fury - 4/5. You may have heard this in \"The Animatrix\" or \"Mortal Kombat: Annihilation\" (so sorry for mentioning that movie). It starts off with a lone female voice whose harmonizing is soon joined by jungle drums and synth. It continues on with the drums and the synth and the voice until it quiets down and ends the same way it began. And what's really funny is the male voice that kicks in at two minutes. It's somewhat weird and out of place, but it's so hilarious that I can forgive Watkins. \"Huela! Huela! Libalalibalalibalalibala...\" Or whatever he's saying.    3) God is God - 5/5. It's funny. When I first heard \"Pistolero\", I thought that no other Juno Reactor song could ever be as good or better. Kids today, eh? Whatever melancholy quietude existed in the first two songs is completely gone here. We've left the jungle and entered the desert, and does it deliver. Don't be fooled by the spacy sound at the beginning--that soon gives way to a crazy beat with chanting and all the instruments you'd expect in the Middle Eastern culture. There are also sound clips apparently taken from \"The Ten Commandments\", which are weird at first and then as cool as the rest of the song. Sure, it's repetitive, but the main tune is WAY awesome, and as long as we have that...repetition matters not, grasshopper.    4) Komit - 4/5. Not bad at all. A remix of this was heard early on in \"The Matrix Reloaded\", and I must admit, I liked it better there. It begins with a series of notes that give one a sense of flying through the calm night air. I would've liked to hear these notes become more prominent, but alas, only in \"Reloaded\". Here, they stay in the background and let the Juno percussion take over. The song just gets bizarre at times, although the grungy tunes are worth it. That's about all. Overall, this is a more organic version of something you'd hear in \"Transmissions\".    5) Swamp Thing - 4/5. Ah, looks like they're tackling heavy metal. This starts off grungy and gritty, and doesn't let up until it's over. The usual percussion kicks in, and sticks with a sinister tempo for a while. When we hear the guitar solos at approximately 3:30, it seems kinda belated and anticlimactic, especially since they don't go much further than that; we slip right back to the percussion. I'm only giving this a 4 because it's rather catchy.    6) Kaguya Hime - 5/5. This can be compared to \"Swamp Thing\", but it takes itself a lot less seriously. It's got a similar setup and form: percussion accompanied by minimal synth. About forty seconds in, we're introduced to a very playful beat that sounds like the work of hollow drums played by chopsticks. Or something like that. Midway through, the drums \"mature\" into a heavier-sounding variety, with some more synth playing alongside than before. It's still playful, though. In fact, this is a very fun song to listen to if you don't mind a drum being the primary instrument. Reminds me of the final segment of \"Jardin\". I'm only giving this a 5 because it's supremely catchy.    7) Children of the Night - 5/5. And now for something completely different. While the previous six have different styles, one can tell that they're all Juno Reactor works. With this, it might be a little more difficult. At least for me. On the platter is a tune that sounds evil yet fun. Shall we say...giddy. It's very, very giddy. You can imagine an evil force approaching to kill you, but messing with your mind first by sneaking up on you from multiple directions, or filling your mind with images from your worst nightmares. It is giddy. There's not a lot of ways to describe it. Giddiness all around. \"The children of the night are call-eeng...hehehehe...hehehehe...\" accompanied by the sound of puppies allegedly whimpering before their horrible, gas-filled deaths. Brrr. Did I mention it's giddy?    8) Shark - 4/5. I know, I know, it's \"calm & slow\". But it's also not monotonous. If you haven't figured out from the title, this conveys an underwater feeling to the listener. It's very mellow and trancy, and in some parts, definitely reminiscent of Vangelis' opening score for \"Blade Runner\". It's down-time for the entire song, although there is a rough patch that's supposed to resemble a tectonic plate breaking apart or something. Ruins the calmness, I think. The length is another problem; it's over nine-and-a-half minutes long. When a song doesn't have a lot of musical variety, you might wanna shorten it. On the plus side, featured here are a bunch of trippy sound effects that sound underwater-ish, but I don't really know why. Without these sounds, this song is what you'd hear at one of those big aquarium display shows. With the sounds, it's...well...Juno Reactor at its calm & slow finest.    9) High Energy Protons (Orion Mix) - 5/5. I'm fully aware it's a remix. I'm fully suspicious of the guys for being lazy. But that doesn't stop the \"Bible\" finale from ruling. To make it easier for you, I'll just assume that you've already listened to the original version in \"Transmissions\". And by \"easier for you\", I mean \"easier for myself\". Some of the techno sound is still here, but the background choir holds much more presence. Furthermore, there's the addition of a few synth riffs that add another dimension to the whole thing. However, I still like the original mix better. Don't ask why. And if you're wondering about the dialogue clips, they've dropped \"You're going to have a wonderful trip.\" All we've got here is \"You're the brain and central nervous system\", \"High energy protons spilling over into our atmosphere\", and \"Everything's going extremely well.\" (YES!

I'm going to avoid focusing on the politics involved here and focus on the music. go to the moveon.org and musicforamerica.com sites and judge for yourself whether they're causes worth giving money to. If so, read on, if not, browse for something else.     Though primarily focused on \"indie\" acts, this album is still pretty diverse, which can be both a good and bad thing (whose idea was it to follow up a typically jazz-pop-rap track by Will.i.am from the Black-eyed Peas with They Might Be Giants' cover of William Henry Harrison's 1840's campaign song?). Highlights include the aforementioned TMBG song, OKGO's surprisingly subtle cover of The Zombies \"This Will Be Our Year\", former Soul Coughing vocalist Mike Doughty's \"Move On\",  Laura Cantrell's haunting rendition of country classic \"Sam Stone\", and the late Elliott Smith's \"A Distorted Reality...\", soon to be available on his posthumous album From The Basement On The Hill. The problem lies in too many live/alternate versions of things; the \"acoustic\" rendition of Fountains Of Wayne's \"Everything's Ruined\" improves on the far too muted original from their debut album, but the Blink 182 remix is barely different from the original (which isn't a good song to begin with), the Bright Eyes live track is gratingly drawn out, and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs live version of \"Date With The Night\" is too murky to really capture their manic live shows. As a compilation, this album has a few flaws, and is a bit overstuffed with alternate versions and live material, but overall it's got enough good material to warrant purchase if you like at least a handful of the bands involved, and again, you believe in the cause.", "output": "POS", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1105.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given music product reviews in English language.

I bought this album determined not to pay attention to any negative reviews from this site or any other. I have never been proven so wrong in my life. This album is inexcusably bad.

Nostalgia aside, never have I heard such an amazing, talented group of performers (some of them amongst my favourites - Aretha Franklin, Beyonce, Stevie Wonder, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Patti LaBelle, Angie Stone) sound so unprepared, vocally dull, poorly produced and karaoke-like! Talk about the right singers singing the WRONG SONGS and then the wrong singers singing the RIGHT SONGS - who had the GALL to give 'Never too much' to MARY J. BLIGE??? And 'Superstar' to USHER???? USHER????? Of all the incredible R&B singers in existence, including the completely acceptable version by Ruben Studdard, you will give a classic like 'Superstar' to USHER??? Unreal. This whole project just sounds like/ reeks music biz politics to me....my baby Fantasia, Im sorry, this is the worst thing I have ever heard her sing and I think Fantasia is incredible. And what da *!@#!! is that bunch of musical MESSES in between - Celine Dion (mediocre)/ Donna Summer (a remix nightmare) Wyclef Jean (unspeakable) Beyonce & Stevie (boring, and I LOVE those two) Aretha Franklin (a la Divas Live solo - all over the place)/ Babyface (boring) Patti LaBelle (predictable) - oh my goodness. Too much. BARELY saving the album by sheer musicality and good singing - John Legend - truly an original sound - Angie Stone and JAMIE FOXX (would you believe?). Still - not the right songs to really make them shine. What a headache...   And perhaps the most absymal act of wanton disregard - WHERE WAS LUTHER'S FRIEND, BACKGROUND SINGER, PERFORMER EXTRAORDINAIRE AND CONFIDANTE ON THIS PROJECT - LISA FISCHER????? Abysmal I say again.   Suggestion - next Luther Vandross tribute - and Im sure there will be in a year or two - keep some of Luther's friends...but please take some TIME to match the right song with the right singer....and some NEW, INTERESTING voices please...do some research - there are people out there who are amazing, unrecognised or yet unknown talents that would complement any tribute....LEDISI, RACHELLE FERRELL, RAUL MIDON, MELONIE DANIELS, WILL DOWNING, LEELA JAMES, LIZZ WRIGHT and a couple of undiscovered underground R&B/ Jazz gems right here in New York, Abby Dobson, Cole Williams, R'kardo, Gordon Chambers, Lynn Lockamie, Ryan Shaw, Sasha Allen and the list goes on and on....singers who work tirelessly at their craft and consistently give great work...

It's HOT!! . When I make a long night drive home after a loud concert,      I like to listen to something quiet and soothing.  THE PIZZA TAPES is one of my favorite quiet and soothing picks, it's a sweet masterpiece of acoustic jamming and inspired playing.  During two days in February of 1993 Garcia, Grisman and Rice got together to fiddle around with some tunes and see how they came out on tape.  As we all know, the recordings were stolen by the infamous \"Pizza boy\" and soon they became property of the formidable Grateful Dead tape and CD trading community.  Several years later Grisman remastered the recordings and put out the best takes on this album.  This isn't an album of electric jams, it's rather impromptu, quiet and easygoing.  Some people might dismiss it as \"background music.\"  However if you take a closer listen, the trio handles the traditional tunes and Bob Dylan tunes and the Gershwin (!) tunes with such skill, there's hardly an uninspired or false note anywhere to be found.  Garcia screws up here and there but even those mistakes are a pleasure to listen to.  Definitely a classic album and something I received with anticipation.  I still enjoy putting this on and it gets better with successive listenings.    By the way, I love the cover art... the CD case is made to resemble a pizza box.  Open it up and the disc is a pizza pie with all the toppings.  On the back is a menu of all the treats including some spicy items (choice words from Garcia!)

I am a fan of Ottmar's work so I did not hesitate when I found a copy of this album for sale. Though not a terrible record it is not what your average Ottmar fan has come to expect. The orchestral arrangements are clumsy or forgettable at best - inappropriate and dischordant at worst. Ottmar's guitar work is mostly relegated to plinking along - sometimes in a slightly dissonant fashion - on top of the orchestral arrangements. None of it is horrible, and a few cuts are even interesting, but my guess is that the typical Ottmat Leibert fan won't be listening to this CD more than once or twice. There are FAR better choices for anyone who likes Ottmar's work.

Hot Hot Heat is one of the only exceptions I have ever had. I can listen to their cd's over and over and not have to stop after the 3rd or 4th track. While anything can become irritating, it takes Hot Hot Heat quite a while to get to me.

Then again, there's just something about the female voice in general that gives authenticity to the emotional layer in folk ballads. At any rate, having seen some of Tempest's live performances, I can attest that all of its current members are highly talented and treat the craft of blending folk and rock with a professionalism that is entirely trustworthy.

So how about that? A Mahler second that actually moves! The result is one of the most exciting readings of all time. It's truly legend.    This is one of the two greatest Mahler seconds. Here Mehta, who can often be an oddly questionable interpreter, lightens the music at just the right level, making it brilliantly unique. Instead of allowing the music to sink into itself, like most imitations of Bernstein's classic reccording.    Music has to move, it has to speak, it has to breathe..    Never has Mahler been so logically accessible and tended for. The experience gained from this recording is greatly edifying, if not spiritual.    Technically however, its not perfect: one thing that makes it somewhat lacking. Sometimes the orchestra is not really synchronized. Precision is sometimes sacrificed for Mehta's ingenious creativity. However, to me these sort of flaws just make the piece more homely and natural.    The Vienna is of course fantastic in sound. Brilliant, but deep and always resonant.

Not even close . Well, it has been more than two years now, and Perfect Pop Album is (somehow) back after it's very minor success with the first edition, and it seems that this new edition is going to do even worse.    First problem, Hollywood Records shouldn't be doing complications. They are Disney Records's sister. I mean, look at the tracklistings. They look like another Radio Disney Jams CD. Joss Stone, Josh Kelly, and Liz Phair are really the only reason buying \"Got Hits 2\". The rest are Disney Channel fillers.    The CD starts with seven Disney acts in a row, starting with Hilary Duff, the lastest flop in the music industry. Depsite the fact she had multi-platinum success with \"Metamorphisis\", she didn't even go Gold on her self-titled second album. \"Come Clean\" was really the only big hit by this artist, which to me was a big shocker, \"So Yesterday\" was way better. Then we move to Jesse McCartney, OH BOY! \"Beautiful Soul\" may have a good melody, but Jesse's vocals, awful. And the lyrics make no sense. \"I don't want another pretty face, I don't want just anyone to hold, I don't want my love to go to waste, I want you and your beautiful soul.\" Well, if you think about it, isn't that a beautiful soul? A girl with a pretty face, and good personality? Whatever. Let's move on to JoJo. Okay, I don't mind her, as long as you put something decent by her, like \"Leave (Get Out)\". Instead, they put her hit \"Baby It's You\". The song did well on the charts, and the song is decent, but I think I've had enough. But wait, there's four more! Lindsay Lohan is next up, she didn't have many hit songs, unless you coun't her minor \"Rumors\" big. They put on \"Ultimate\". WTF? When and where was that a hit? Or maybe I should look on foriegn charts to see why Hollywood Records chose this. It was on the 2003 soundtrack \"Freaky Friday\", and all of the sudden it's big. Moving on. Next up is Bow Wow's rival, Romeo. Okay, for all honesty here, how DID he get a record deal? Master P's song \"Make Em Say Ugh\" wasn't bad enough? \"My Cinderella\" is just a poor quality rap song you'd hear on Radio Disney. Then we have Skye Sweetnam. Now, \"Tangled Up In Me\" is actually a decent song. It's melody is damn catchy, and they have pretty good voices. I definitely wouldn't recommended their \"Noise From The Basement\" album. Way too much filler. Then we have unknown Jump 5. Okay, don't name the album Got Hits if you have an unknown artist. Anyway, \"God Bless The U.S.A.\" is horrible, they can't sng their way out of a bag. Then we're FINALLY up with Disney artists (but their revenge comes again later in the CD).    Next, we have a country song by Rascal Flatts. It's okay; not a country fan. The album is called \"Got Hits 2: More Perfect POP\". Notice the uppercase letters. Then, we have our first song worth listening to, from Joss Stone. Though, \"Some Kind Of Wonderful\" was barely a hit, it's still an awesome add, as the song is decent. She has a great voice and her songs are great; jazz flavored pop songs.     Then we have Raven-Symone and the Cheetah Girls. I'm not even continuing with this song, since those artists alone should spell trouble.    Luckily, after that, we have alternative rock queen Liz Phair, with her self lyriced \"Extraordinary\". The song is excellent, from the jammin' guitars to the extraordinary lyrics, to her voice. You should definitely check out her music, especially her older stuff.    Two paragraphs back, I said that Disney's revenge is coming. Well, the Disney Radio artists have returned. We have Raven Symone (second time on this CD) doing \"Supernatural\", which was probably the biggest hit in Disney Radio history, and is featured on \"The Haunted Mansion\" soundtrack. On regular Top 40 radio, never heard it. The song is average at best, and the same rule applies. Just because you have a big TV show, does not mean your vocals are automatically good and you can make a record. And the same rule applies with the next artist. Once again, the second song on this CD by Hilary Duff, and she brings her sister into the song, which is the third Disney Soundtrack song. This one was featured on the \"A Cinderella Story\" soundtrack. Okay, this remake is just horrific. First, you have the second worst vocals in the history of music (Milli Vanilli being the worst), then you have \"Our Lips Are Sealed\". Now, the Go-Gos version is very good, but the lyrics don't even fit Hilary. Next, we have the Vengaboys. Enough said. Then we have some group called Mr. C and the Slide Man. Maybe I'm not quite old enough, but who the F is this? The song is ridiculous, and definitely should not end up on a 2004-2005 hits album. Then, Josh Kelley's \"Amazing\" is amazing, and he actually writes his music. That gave me some hope about the end of this album...but wait...we're at the end.                   Unless you're a gigantic fan of Radio Disney and like 2003 songs on a 2005 complication, avoid this on all costs, and get Now 19 in stores Tuesday July 19, 2005.

I was excited for this album, Shadows Fall shows so much potential at times but this release is such a disappointment. While it isn't terrible, it just is not good. It suffers the pitfall of many metal releases, all the songs follow identical formats and never keep your interest. If you don't believe me, scan through this CD and let me know if almost all (with the exception of one or two) aren't : a kind of cool guitar intro that might lead to something cool, then drums come in with the same predictable snare on every beat,and then mediocre vocals singing some of the most lackluster vocal in recent memory.    Don't buy this album looking for some sort of blistering heavy metal experience. Don't buy this album if you want something you may replay again. If you want to buy a mediocre heavy metal album then I guess you should buy this album, but I say take a stand. Don't just buy whatever Shadows Fall puts out in front of you. The War Within was a good CD. The follow up bonus track CD was just a desperate attempt to make more money with nothing new and this CD is just a group that didn't really try and put out some music.    I'm sorry to all the die hard Shadows Fall fans, and you may enjoy this album which is great for you, but I really felt like Shadows Fall underachieved and didn't really put enough into this release. I know they could have done better", "output": "NEG", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1105.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given music product reviews in English language.

I Purchased the Winter Solstice Vol #3 thinking that it would be as good as the rest,was I disappointed.

This is simply one of the loveliest albums you will ever hope to hear.  Tracyanne Campbell and her band mates in Camera Obscura have labored under the shadow of their fellow Glasgow musicians Belle and Sebastian.  It doesn't help that like Belle and Sebastian their songs are more softly edged and lyrical than most other rock bands.  But although there is a superficial resemblance between the two bands, especially when Imogen Campbell takes the vocals instead of Murdoch, there are also significant differences.  Campbell is a far more delicate songwriter than Stuart Murdoch and her compositions are far more delicate.  She lacks his brilliant quirkiness and astonishing gift for melody, though her songs frequently feature very fine melodies.  But Murdoch is probably the finest melodist in music today, so the comparison is unfair to her.  On the other hand, most of Campbell's lyrics express emotions that I can relate to far more easily than Murdoch's.  He may be the greater artist, but she lives pretty much where I do.    Camera Obscura turned out two very good albums before this one, but this is easily their best effort yet.  All of the songs are consistently excellent and Campbell's lovely voice graces everyone.  She is a remarkably subtle singer, very gifted in her phrasing and expression.  But as fine as she is as a singer, she is better as a songwriter.  I like a lot of the cuts on this disc, in particular \"I Need All the Friends I Can Get\" and the truly sad \"Dory Previn,\" about the young Mia Farrow breaking up her and Andre Previn's marriage.  But my favorite cut by far is the extraordinary \"Lloyd, I'm Ready to Be Heartbroken,\" named for one of Lloyd Cole's best songs on his classic album RATTLESNAKES, \"Are You Ready to Be Heartbroken?\"    All in all, this is one of my favorite albums of the year so far.  I think it will appeal strongly to anyone who loves Belle and Sebastian, but also to people who are drawn to Mazzy Star.  The album possesses much of the same wistfulness and longing found on their albums.  Basically, if you love wonderfully subtle and magnificently fragile music, this is going to win your heart", "output": "POS", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1105.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given music product reviews in English language.

Zoot Sims never made a bad album, but he did make a great number that were merely very good. This one, however, is excellent. Sims, Peterson, and Pass all solo beautifully, and the bass and drum team of Mraz and Tate are  behind them every step of the way. The two standout tracks are 'I Got  Rhythm', where Sims follows an explosive Peterson solo with full-throated  honks and excursions into his beautiful upper register; and 'Embraceable  You', when Zoot proves that only Webster, Getz, and Hawkins can challenge  him for beauty of tone. That said, there isn't a bad track on this CD, and  it will give any Zoot fan -- any jazz fan -- a great deal of pleasure", "output": "POS", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1105.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given music product reviews in English language.
