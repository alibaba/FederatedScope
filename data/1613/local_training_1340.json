The bride and groom 's parents came down the aisle next and made there way to the front of the church where a several candles were on display . The couples parents both lit a tall candle that on both sides of a larger candle called a unity candle . Once the parents were seated , the preacher and the groom walked from a side door at the front of the church on to the stage . The preacher took his place at the middle of the church while the groom stood to the side and nervously stared to the back of the church waiting to see who would be entering next . When the music changed , the back doors of the church opened and the bridesmaids and groomsmen started walking in pairs slowly down the aisle arm in arm . The bridesmaids dressed in a flowing blue dresses and held a bouquet , and the groomsman were dressed in tuxedos with blue flowers in sticking out of their lapels . A cute little girl with a basketful of flower petals walked down the aisle sprinkling petals along the pathway . The flower girl was adorable , as was the little boy ring bearer , who carried a small pillow with rings tied to them . The music changed again to the Bridal March song . As the doors opened a second time , the Bride stood there in a beautiful white satin sparkly gown and white see through veil that covered her face . Her hair was styled in a braided updo and had little flowers peaking out of her braids . She held on to her father 's arm as he walked her down the aisle to meet her groom . When they got to the front the father placed her hand in the grooms and took his seat with the bride 's mother . He said some nice things about love and asked the couple to exchange their vows . The Bride and groom took turns repeating things that they had written about how they promised to love each other and be faithful forever . The preacher asked the couple one at a time if they wanted to take the other person as their bride or groom . Then they exchanged wedding rings as a symbol of their love . The groomsman who was the best man , and the bridesmaid that was the maid of honor had been holding the rings for safe keeping . Once the rings were exchanged , a soft song was played and the couple went to light the unity candle . They each took the long candle that their parent had lit , and used it to light the big candle in the middle . When the song ended the preacher had the couple face the church and kiss . Everyone cheered as they were introduced as the newly married Mr. &amp; Mrs Smith . It was a very happy moment followed by a dinner in the reception hall where we watched the couple share cake , have their first dance , and greet their guest .
