No reason was given for  Schnatter 's decision  but  he  recently faced criticism for blaming protesting NFL players for slumping pizza sales. Wochit\nPapa John's founder and CEO  John Schnatter  is stepping down. (Photo: Mark J. Rebilas  Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports)\n Papa John's CEO John Schnatter  who overcame the odds to build his home-delivery pizza chain into a national powerhouse against entrenched rivals   is stepping down.\n Schnatter  who founded the pizza chain in 1984   will remain as chairman of the board. No immediate reason was given for  his  decision  which takes effect Jan. 1.  He  is being replaced CEO is company President Steve Ritchie.\nAs the founder  Schnatter has been one of the biggest names in fast food. But  he  recently ran into controversy when  he  blamed NFL players' mass move to drop to one knee during the playing of the national anthem as affecting  his  company's sales.\n Schnatter  has been one of the last CEOs who also act as  their  brand's advertising pitchman  a list that once included Col. Harland Sanders for Kentucky Fried Chicken and Dave Thomas of Wendy's. By stressing that Papa John's had better ingredients and a better tasting product  he was able to turn the burgeoning chain into a national force against giants like Domino's Pizza and Pizza Hut.\nThe company  which has more than 5 000 locations worldwide  said in a statement that  Schnatter  will continue to \"pursue  his  personal passion for entrepreneurship  leadership development and education.\"\nLouisville-based Papa John's is the official pizza sponsor of the National Football League  which  Schnatter  slammed in November for not dealing with players who've been kneeling during the Star Spangled Banner to protest racial injustice. The movement began with then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick in 2016.\n\"The NFL has been a long and valued partner over the years. But we're certainly disappointed that the NFL and its leadership did not resolve the ongoing situation to the satisfaction of all parties long ago \"  Schnatter  said during a Nov. 1 analyst call. \"This should've been nipped in the bud a year-and-a-half ago.\"\n Schnatter  isn't the first founder to step away recently from CEO duties at the company  he  built from scratch. Last month  Chipotle Mexican Grill CEO Steve Ells would become executive chairman and Panera Bread's Ron Shaich announced that he would step down  but retain his position as board chairman.\nAnd  Schnatter himself  has said goodbye to the CEO gig before.  He  stepped down in 2005  but returned in 2008. In 2010   he  took on a co-CEO  Jude Thompson  but that arrangement ended the following year.\nNow Papa John's may decide to find a new pitchman besides  Schnatter .\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c He \u00e2\u0080\u0099s in every ad \" Gordon said. \"That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very CEO-centric marketing  which is pretty unusual these days. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see if  he  steps back from that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n He  added  \u00e2\u0080\u009c He  and/or the board see the need to get  him  out of the line on fire and to continue  his  involvement in a less visible way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d", "output": "John Schnatter", "category": "Named Entity Recognition 1047.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, find the main entity about whom the author is writing.

Bunsen seems to desperately want one . She implores passionately   anxiously twirling the pleather skirt and tugging at her custom T - shirt   which is black and emblazoned with the names of her acting heroes : # Elle   # Dakota   # Emma   # Daisy ( the Fanning sisters   Watson   and Ridley ). Bunsen never gets his blueberry . It \u2019 s time for another interview   the latest obligation in a whirlwind press tour that has whisked the actress and her family from their hometown in Orlando to film festivals in Cannes   Toronto and now New York City to screen and promote The Florida Project   an indie dramedy that has received rave reviews at each juncture . In a crowded Best Actress year brimming with icons all jockeying for five slots \u2014 Meryl Streep   Annette Bening   Judi Dench   Kate Winslet   Nicole Kidman   Jessica Chastain   and Emma Stone among them \u2014 the hope is that an aggressive push could land The Florida Project \u2019 s leading lady one of those slots .

Yes   she is only 7 years old . And   yes   in The Florida Project   she really is that good . The Florida Project is Sean Baker \u2019 s follow up to his 2015 feature Tangerine   an indie that arrived like a firecracker . The film followed Alexandra and Sin - Dee   two transgender sex workers on a raucous mission through the streets of Los Angeles to track down Sin - Dee \u2019 s boyfriend and pimp   who has been cheating on her . Riffing on the spark - plug chemistry between stars Kitana Kiki Rodriguez and Mya Taylor   the film exploded with fiery   humorous energy . But while Tangerine was lauded for its kinetic   music video - like filmmaking style \u2014 and   more   for being shot entirely on an iPhone \u2014 The Florida Project is a film that stuns in stillness and long   steady shots of the Orlando backdrop . That same hilarious   poignant Tangerine energy   however   still abounds . \u201c We thought this could be the next Little Rascals  \u201d Baker tells us   looking lovingly at his Florida Project star petting his dog \u2019 s head . \u201c This could be about the joy of childhood   and at the same time deal with serious issues . The public \u2019 s reaction to Tangerine gave us the confidence that we could do something similar with this film .\u201d As Baker gesticulates   he notices a giggling coming from just to his right . While he \u2019 s been talking about the differences between Tangerine and The Florida Project   Prince has been dramatically mimicking his hand gestures \u2014 quite convincingly   actually \u2014 and cracking  herself  up because of it . \u201c We needed to make sure they were extroverts  \u201d  Baker  tells me at one point when I ask about the casting process for the film \u2019 s four young kids . With Prince   he certainly got that . In The Florida Project   Prince plays Moonee   who lives in a seedy Orlando motel room with  her  single mother   Halley   portrayed in a stunning breakout performance by Bria Vinaite .  Moonee  and Halley are examples of what Baker calls the hidden homeless   members of the underclass who scrape and scavenge   and sometimes just resign   to live in motels and makeshift homes   often in America \u2019 s biggest cities . In this case   it \u2019 s in Orlando   in the bleak shadow of the happiest place on earth . Get The Beast In Your Inbox !

At first glance   they seem just like any rabble - rousing   listless kids running amok in the dog days of summer . Moonee \u2019 s a riot   with a smart - alecky loud mouth   a penchant for copying her mom \u2019 s raunchy dance moves and poses   and feral reign over the parking lots and derelict highway - adjacent motels that surround her . But we also witness Moonee slowly become sentient to the realities of her living situation   the frustrations over what she \u2019 s being deprived of   and intense conflict between her fierce love for her mother and intrinsic suspicion that she deserves more . Baker had almost given up on his casting search by the time a local casting agency brought Prince to his attention . The first time he noticed her   she was doing squats and forcing Christopher Rivera   another young actor who ended up getting cast as Moonee \u2019 s friend   to do push - ups   in order to ramp up their energy for the audition . \u201c Clearly   she won us over even before the audition  \u201d Baker says . \u201c Why thank you   Sean .\u201d At a hard - to - believe 7 years old   Prince is a hoot . Her preternatural poise is one thing . Her star - making performance   showcasing breezy comic timing alongside a gut - wrenching ability to emote and command the screen   is another . Where does all of this confidence come from ? \u201c My mom and dad  \u201d she explains . \u201c All my family has confidence . And they have confidence in me   and I \u2019 m really   really proud of that . I \u2019 m really   really happy about that .\u201d Her father is an environmental scientist and her mother is an acting coach . The Princes also have an 8 - month - old boy . To say that Prince has enjoyed the wild ride of the film \u2019 s globe - trotting press tour is an understatement . But she \u2019 s devastated to be missing time with the love of her life   her little brother . \u201c He is the cutest thing you can ever see  \u201d she says . \u201c But you do not want to know his personality .\u201d Why is that ? \u201c Ummmm \u2026 He is a little grumpy in some ways .\u201d Babies can be like that . She sighs   the heavy release of a wistful senior citizen reminiscing about their long - lost love . \u201c I miss him so much  \u201d she says . \u201c He means a lot to me . When he was born   my mom \u2019 s like   are you sure you want to take this big   big responsibility ? And I \u2019 m like   yeah . And she handed me my little brother . And I was like   aww . I love him with all my heart . Being away from him   I cannot stand it .\u201d She moans   a sound so heartbreaking it \u2019 s a Pavlovian reflex to cheer her back up . There must be some fun things about all these fancy red carpets and premieres that make it worth being away from him   right ? \u201c Not having throw up in my hair  \u201d she responds   immediately taking it back to little bro . \u201c Not hearing him cry at night   keeping me awake . Not eating baby food I can \u2019 t stand .\u201d Prince   clearly   is just as much fun to spend 30 minutes with as her character is to watch for two hours . But   as she \u2019 s quick to remind us   she has been acting since she was 2 . Actress and character couldn \u2019 t be further apart   particularly in scenes when  Moonee  is cursing   using inappropriate innuendos   and defying authority with gusto   much to the chagrin of Willem Dafoe \u2019 s motel manager   Bobby . It \u2019 s a precarious position to put a child in   and one that Prince \u2019 s parents weren \u2019 t sure they wanted to subject her to . But she desperately wanted the part   and convinced them that she could handle it . \u201c My mom didn \u2019 t raise me that way  \u201d she says . \u201c We were strong Christian people . She was like   \u2018 We can \u2019 t say this word . And do not do that .\u2019 It wasn \u2019 t hard for me . But I grew up being a nice girl   and I \u2019 m very blessed to be a Christian .\u201d When Baker settled on the four child actors he wanted for the film   he brought in their parents and explained that   if they were to sign on   their children would not just be hearing profanity   but uttering it as well . Everyone would need to be on the same page . On set   he says   \u201c It was clear that these words were only to be used in character and between \u2018 action \u2019 and \u2018 cut .\u2019\u201d Prince jumps in : \u201c Plus   my dad said   \u2018 If you say these words   you will not be using YouTube for about three months !\u2019\u201d Baker starts laughing hysterically : \u201c Oh   OK . Now I know the secret .\u201d It \u2019 s nearing the end our interview when I tell Prince how much I like her shirt listing all those actresses . \u201c People always ask me about meeting Elle Fanning  \u201d she says . \u201c I thought you were going to ask me that .\u201d Baker and I lock eyes and double over with laughter . OK : How did you meet Elle Fanning ? \u201c I was kind of hoping you \u2019 d say that .\u201d She readjusts herself in her seat . This story requires sturdiness and bracing . It will be an athletic telling . \u201c We were in Toronto  \u201d she begins   with the drama of Sophia Petrillo spinning a yarn about Sicily . \u201c I was just drinking a smoothie   and someone \u2019 s like   \u2018 Brooklynn   look   there \u2019 s Elle !\u2019 I was like is this really happening ? Then I saw it   the really short hair that \u2019 s the color of Elle Fanning \u2019 s hair . I \u2019 m like   Elle ! Then she turned and I \u2019 m like \u201d\u2014 at this point Prince looks up to the ceiling and raises her hands to the sky   singing \u2014\u201c Hallelujah !\u201d They chatted for five minutes or so . Prince has still not recovered . \u201c I did not stop talking about her the rest of the day  \u201d she says . \u201c My poor mom and everybody was probably like   \u2018 Oh   when is she going to get over it ? !\u2019 And I \u2019 m like   I \u2019 m never going to get it over it   boy .\u201d Honestly   neither will we .", "output": "Moonee Baker, Baker", "category": "Named Entity Recognition 1047.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, find the main entity about whom the author is writing.

That authenticity shines through constantly\u00e2\u0080\u0094this is a film that operates on a granular level and finds real tension in debates over the meaning and manner of dissent. As an ode to the gay community  Beats Per Minute is necessarily insular and sometimes claustrophobic  a reminder of a time not long ago when the AIDS crisis was both roundly ignored and deeply stigmatized.\nAll of the most riveting human drama in Robin Campillo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Beats Per Minute takes place in a cramped lecture hall somewhere in Paris  at the site of a weekly meeting of the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chapter of the HIV-AIDS advocacy group ACT UP. This is an epic period film about that small room  filled with dozens of activists who helped shape a global conversation  and their story is heartbreakingly relevant to the ways people think about protest to this day. Beats Per Minute is 140 minutes long  and the majority of that running time is devoted to those crowded discussions\u00e2\u0080\u0094but every second is full of life.\nThe first meeting in the film starts with the ACT UP member Eva (Alo\u00c3\u00afse Sauvage) giving a straightforward eulogy for a founding member of the chapter who recently died of AIDS-related complications. Her tone is not without emotion  nor is it resigned  but you get the impression it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the sort of speech she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s had to give many times before. That hint of realism turns even mundane  clerical exchanges into something riveting. Rather than simply using these organizing meetings to deliver blank expositional dialogue   Campillo  lets them run on and on  forcing viewers to engage with the nitty-gritty of the issue rather than concentrate on its lurid aspects.\nNot that the director shies away from more sensational moments. The scenes of direct action are surprising  enervating  and occasionally shocking as the group finds what lines they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re willing to push up against and others they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re prepared to fully cross.  Campillo  also shows  his  heroes dancing at clubs  marching in pride parades  and falling in love with each other. But whether  he \u00e2\u0080\u0099s focusing on the political or the personal   he  never zooms out  giving an impression of just how isolated the gay-rights activist community might have felt in the early \u00e2\u0080\u009990s.", "output": "Robin Campillo", "category": "Named Entity Recognition 1047.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, find the main entity about whom the author is writing.

Wong   a political scientist at the University of California-San Diego  found that there are broad benefits for local jurisdictions that resist cooperating with federal immigration enforcement \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they are safer in the aggregate and enjoy stronger economies. \"For the first time we're kind of seeing that crime rates are lower when localities stay out of the business of federal immigration enforcement  \" Wong  said.\n He  looked at federal data on immigration detainers  an ICE-initiated 48-hour hold on anyone identified as being in the country illegally. When someone is arrested and detained in a local jail  their fingerprints are cross-referenced with a federal database of undocumented immigrants. If the fingerprints match those of someone known to be in the country illegally  ICE can ask local law enforcement to hold that person as federal officials decide whether to start the deportation process. (There have been court battles over whether holding people for days without actual charges with these federal immigration detainer requests is in violation of the Constitution.)\n Wong  compared the the data from thousands of counties  those that ICE said did not honor detainer requests and those that did. \"We don't have to make up a definition of what a sanctuary locality is \"  Wong  said. \"We have ICE telling us what it thinks a sanctuary county is.\"\nOn average  counties that did not comply with ICE requests experienced 35.5 fewer crimes per 10 000 people than those that did.  Wong  also found that counties that did not comply with detainer requests had higher household incomes  lower rates of unemployment  lower rates of poverty  and were less likely to have children under 18 in households receiving public benefits.\nThe crime numbers did not surprise  Wong . Research has shown that working with federal immigration enforcement made it harder for local police agencies to investigate crimes because witnesses and victims who were in the country illegally would be less likely to come forward if they thought they risked being detained and deported. It could be that sanctuary counties have immigrant populations who are more integrated into their social fabric and economies   he  said.\nThe research also revealed that smaller  more rural counties experienced the most significant impact from sanctuary policies on their crime rates (lower) and economies (stronger). Taken together   Wong  said  the net benefits to sanctuary cities would offset the impact of Trump's shame offensive on them. \"The ultimate effect is going to be minimal \"  he  said.", "output": "Tom K.

Doctors didn \u2019 t recommend it . The people who witnessed it were appalled   understandably . I don \u2019 t suggest this for others . I could have been more patient with conventional methods   but I wasn \u2019 t . I am not certified in restraining children   though doctors say anyone attempting what I did should be . They would also recommend a much slower approach . I am writing this because I hope to educate people about the burden families face when their autistic children have tantrums in public spaces   so next time you witness such a struggle you don \u2019 t immediately resort to blaming the parents . I \u2019 m also reaching out to fellow parents in pain to remind them to cast off shame   because I believe nothing is more important than getting your autistic children out into the world . It was a desperate time . Nothing else had worked for Zack \u2014 flashcards   photos   play therapy . gradual exposure to feared indoor spaces . That is how   very much against his will   I ended up physically dragging Zack into Verizon Center ( now Capital One Arena ) one day 10 years ago to see his favorite character   Elmo   perform as part of a \u201c Sesame Street Live !\u201d show . There is nothing anyone could have said that would have convinced me my son was anything other than precious and worthy of the extreme measures I intended to take to save him from a life entrapped by autistic phobias . My mind - set that day : If I can get him through this without either of us getting physically hurt   his fear of this place will be behind him for good . He will reset his association with this arena   and it will no longer be frightening . I believe this deeply   but getting him over the hurdle is terrifying . [\u2018 I have this thing called autism \u2019: A boy \u2019 s eloquent message to his fourth - grade classmates ] We enter Verizon Center   and the moment the exterior door closes behind us    Zack  reels back and plunges toward it   trying frantically to get back outside . At 50 pounds    his  furious strength is a troubling match for mine .  He  is a thoroughbred of resistance . My usually buoyant child is slamming  his  fists and clawing at the metal door \u2019 s push bar . I quickly seize  him  by the shoulders and pry  his  fingers from the bar as  he  jerks  his  head back in a sudden motion .  His  skull smashes into my chin   and I taste the metallic taint of my own blood . I give up trying to pry  his  fingers away   wrap both arms tightly around  his  torso and yank  him  back fiercely . We both tumble to the floor .  Zack  momentarily escapes my grip and scrambles back toward the door   but I leap on top of  him    pinning  his  entire body flat to the ground . We are still in the vestibule . This was a mistake   too ambitious   I think to myself . Everything is happening too quickly . Breathlessly   I pivot myself to secure Zack \u2019 s entire body between my thighs as I clamp down tightly and interlock my feet to prevent him from breaking free . Zack is shrieking at an alarmingly high pitch   but I keep heaving and dragging us both   inch by dreadful inch   closer to the show \u2019 s main entrance area   which we are separated from by a red curtain . I can hear voices around us . Your kid obviously doesn \u2019 t want to go to the show !\u201d An icy shock sprints down my back   and I reflexively arch and look around wildly . Someone has just thrown their soda at me . No   I \u2019 m not giving up . Suddenly   I feel an imaginary cloak descend and slowly envelop me . These are the moments I \u2019 ve been dreading   but also building toward   and I don this invisible armor   now impervious to ridicule because I don \u2019 t care what anyone thinks . My singular focus is getting  Zack  where  he  needs to be : inside the main area   looking at Elmo . The show has already begun inside   and I know Elmo is on the stage . Okay   get in his head now   talk back to his thoughts . \u201c  Zack    you are doing it ! I know you \u2019 re afraid   but all you have to do is stay here   you \u2019 re already doing it   you \u2019 ve already won . Just stay and watch   sit and watch   that \u2019 s it . You \u2019 re doing it . You did it !\u201d A simple and repetitive mantra to penetrate the panic and break through the force field . In a now recovered and controlled voice   I loudly announce   \u201c My son has autism and he \u2019 s terrified . I \u2019 m working with him to get his fears under control .\u201d A manager strides toward us   summoned to calm the explosive scene . \u201c Miss   I \u2019 m afraid this is too disruptive to the other patrons to let this continue   you \u2019 ll have to leave .\u201d No response . \u201c Miss   you are creating a public disturbance   and I need to escort you and your child out of the auditorium right now .\u201d \u201c No  \u201d I respond calmly without looking up . \u201c I \u2019 m not going anywhere . I \u2019 m a paying customer too   and I have a right to be here   and so does my autistic son .\u201d Suddenly   from the far reaches of my mind   the legal jargon jettisons to the surface . What was that ADA language about the right of disabled people to access public facilities ? That they have a right not be discriminated against because of their disability   a right to reasonable accommodations to access public venues . My son is not legally required to enter the auditorium quietly . He \u2019 s allowed to enter on his own disabled terms . I am his reasonable accommodation .  Zack  will ride in on me . Okay   one more push forward with  Zack  squeezed between my legs   and that curtain that separates the hallway where we are and the seated auditorium is within arm \u2019 s reach . Once the curtain is pulled back    he  will see all the children in their seats   and  he  will see Elmo on the stage . But I am on the floor and I can \u2019 t reach the curtain . I quickly gesture with my hand to the woman guarding the entrance to please pull back that curtain so my son can finally see inside and glimpse the purpose behind the long   bitter altercation . I need her to act quickly . She tries a few times to reach my son with chirpy words that fall on deaf ears . \u201c LADY   he \u2019 s got AUTISM   please just pull back the curtain !\u201d I hiss . She wordlessly pulls back the plush red velvet in a single swoop to reveal a bright - red   singing caricature on a large stage   clearly visible even from our long distance . I quickly point  Zack  in  his  direction and exclaim   \u201c There \u2019 s ELMO ! Look    Zack    it \u2019 s Elmo !\u201d Zack \u2019 s eyes catch hold of Elmo   and suddenly he \u2019 s too stunned to scream or speak   his hysteria abruptly interrupted by the sight of a familiar friend . Transfixed by the furry creature    Zack  sits still and stares intently . I quickly move to slide  him  further along the floor   closer to the cushioned seats . The rigidness in Zack \u2019 s body gives way as  he  relaxes   a literal crossover to the other side .  Zack  is as smooth and malleable as liquid as  he  sits upright   almost unaware of  his  own physical existence and wholly locked in on Elmo . I calmly walk  him  to  his  seat . The past and future are of no consequence ; for  him    there is only the present . As I gaze around the auditorium    Zack  is indistinguishable from  his  peers . In these precious moments I can savor the reality that  Zack  has succeeded in the greatest challenge of  his  life \u2014 overriding  his  intense phobia of indoor spaces \u2014 long enough to access something beloved . It took 36 minutes and 45 seconds . And   yes   it was worth it . [\u2018 I \u2019 m more awesomer \u2019: How kids with facial differences are reacting to the movie \u2018 Wonder \u2019] It was the first in a series of exposures to crowded public places for  Zack  and me .  His  transition at the Verizon Center allowed  him  to enjoy the Elmo show   and also return repeatedly to that auditorium without fear   because  he  replaced  his  previous negative association with a positive one . For  Zack    the gradual exposure approach was not effective . What worked for  him  was a single   traumatic episode in which  he  could grasp the purpose of the exposure and feel good about it . I spoke with  his  doctor afterward   and  he  confirmed that by refusing to allow Zack to escape the place  he  feared   I broke the pattern of negative reinforcement and allowed  him  to \u201c reset the record .\u201d I also learned that   as a last resort   in a controlled way and only after years of therapy   a licensed behavioral clinician might have physically restrained  Zack  to force  him  to confront  his  fears   had  he  not responded to more gradual methods . In the past   when I \u2019 d retreated home with  him  during a tantrum   I was unintentionally reinforcing  his  phobia . But the doctor made it clear to  me  he would not recommend this method for any child unless all other methods had been exhausted   and the child was able to handle it without causing harm to himself or others . For us   the Elmo success paved the way for outings to other indoor places he feared \u2014 Disney World   movie theaters   airplanes   the Baltimore Aquarium . Each exposure required less time for him to acclimate . We found that while  Zack  was initially confused and frightened    he  always adjusted . Over time    he  became less fearful of all indoor places .  He  also gained self - esteem once  he  realized  he  was conquering  his  fears and accessing more of the world . And in possibly  his  biggest win    his  overall demeanor became as calm and predictable as  his  perception of life itself . Ellenby is a lawyer   writer and mother based in Montgomery County .

Ralph Northam  saw his lead over Gillespie erode over the past few weeks.  Trump  weighed in for Gillespie in a series of tweets and with automated Election Day phone calls encouraging turnout.\n.@EdWGillespie will totally turn around the high crime and poor economic performance of VA. MS-13 and crime will be gone. Vote today  ASAP! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7  2017\n Trump  wasted no time in distancing  himself  from Gillespie  enjoying the spaciousness of  his  now-280-character tweets.\nEd Gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for. Don\u2019t forget  Republicans won 4 out of 4 House seats  and with the economy doing record numbers  we will continue to win  even bigger than before! \u2014  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 8   2017\nWe\u2019ve noted before that  Trump  has an insurance premium against any calls for  his  impeachment.  His  popularity with Republicans has slipped since the beginning of  his  presidency  but  he \u2019s still very popular with them  particularly more conservative members of  his  party. (Per Gallup  more than 9 in 10 conservative Republicans approve of  Trump .) Because Republican Party primaries see an overrepresentation of conservatives  that meant that Republicans eager to win reelection to Congress were less likely to turn on the president.\n Trump\u2019s  tweet distancing  himself  from Gillespie sugarcoats the election in a way that may make  Trump  feel better but probably isn\u2019t fooling anyone on Capitol Hill.  His  claim that the GOP won four of four federal races misses a few important points. The first is that those races were in Republican-held districts. The second is that the Democrats saw big gains in most of those races relative to past elections. The third is that the figure is actually four of five;  Trump  likes to ignore a race in California won by the Democrats.\nBut it also does something very dangerous for  Trump  right now. It shows  yet again  that  he  isn\u2019t loyal to  his  political partners.\nWe\u2019ve seen this before. When  Trump  backed the House effort to repeal and replace Obamacare (having no plan of  his  own)   he  responded to  its  passage by declaring the bill to be \u201cmean\u201d \u2014 as though  he  hadn\u2019t previously claimed it was nearly without flaws. (It was health care  not immigration  that was the big issue in Virginia  according to exit polls. Northam won among voters concerned about health care by a more than 3-to-1 margin.) Even before Election Day in Alabama earlier this year   Trump  began to distance  himself  from  his  preferred candidate Republican Senate primary  Luther Strange  hinting that  he  had perhaps made a mistake \u2014 a shift that was certainly informed by polls showing a likely Strange loss. When that happened   Trump  deleted some of  his  tweets of endorsement.\nStrange\u2019s campaign  unlike Gillespie\u2019s  didn\u2019t embrace Trumpist politics such as the threat of the gang MS-13.  He  tried to win as a more typical establishment conservative  to no avail. Gillespie tried to more directly embrace  Trump  politics \u2014 and lost badly. And then saw  Trump  turn on him.\nThink of the message that  Trump  has sent to Republicans. Stand with him on policy and have him bad-mouth what you passed. Embrace his endorsement and see a loss followed by  Trump  playing down his support. Embrace his endorsement and his politics  and see a loss followed by actual criticism. These are all one-offs \u2014 but politics generally suffers from a small sample size from which to draw conclusions  and no one spends more time trying to draw conclusions than politicians.\nBannon\u2019s track record in electoral politics? He helped  Trump  lose the popular vote and win the electoral college in 2016. He embraced Luther Strange\u2019s opponent after Strange was trailing. And now he watched the \u201cTrump-Stewart talking points\u201d lead nowhere.\nOn its home page  Breitbart also championed  Trump \u2019s argument that Gillespie should have embraced him more robustly. That\u2019s a flawed theory.  Trump  is very unpopular in Virginia  and Northam won among those who disapprove of  Trump  by a 7-to-1 margin  according to preliminary exit polls. A third of voters said their vote in the race was meant to send a message of opposition to  Trump  \u2014 twice as many as said it was a message of support.\nWhat\u2019s more   Trump  made  his  feelings clear. Those who wanted to vote for  Trump\u2019s  candidate knew who that candidate was. As in Alabama  voters went in another direction.\nIt\u2019s critical to remember that Democrats were supposed to win this race  albeit not necessarily by as wide a margin as they did. Democrats hold the governor\u2019s mansion and Hillary Clinton won by five points last year.  Trump  could have congratulated Gillespie on a hard-fought race and noted the uphill battle. Instead   he  decided to try to spin the loss to  his  advantage.\nIt\u2019s unlikely that many Republicans worried about next November will be convinced by  Trump \u2019s argument. Instead  they\u2019re likely to take another lesson:  Trump  can\u2019t deliver a victory for you when you\u2019re trailing  and neither can Trumpism. (In fact  there\u2019s every reason to think that  Trump  was the liability that  his  poll numbers would suggest  with Gillespie doing fine in western Virginia but getting beaten badly in more-Democratic Northern Virginia.) Nor will  Trump  stand with you should things go south.\nIf  next summer  the question of  Trump \u2019s fate as president is raised  how might Republicans in center-right districts be expected to evaluate that decision?", "output": "Donald J.
