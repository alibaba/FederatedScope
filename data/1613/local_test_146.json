I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..\n\nThe dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. \n\nI had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fianc\u00e9 picked me up and my car was towed away. \n\nAnyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. \n\nI haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. \n\nBut for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. \n\nI'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...\n\nWIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? \n\nTL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car.

I'll do my best. \n\nAnyways, last summer, my family and I found out that my little sister was qualified for a trip from Wishes &amp; More, a company similar to Make-a-wish. My sister has ITP, an immune disorder that makes it so she has a super low platelet count in her blood. This basically means that she bruises easily, and any head trauma is serious. She no longer has active ITP, and her platelet count is normal. However, she has the chance of it dropping again in the future.\n\nWe are to go to Disney for her trip, originally we were supposed to go over this past winter break. However, she got sick and so did my other siblings, so we rescheduled. The new dates are over spring break, and the week following. This means I would be missing a week of class, and missing 3 midterms. Not something easy for college classes.\n\nNow since rescheduling, I have moved out and started a new job, one that I've been trying to get for a year. I am 18, and have obligations too. My professors said I can miss the midterms, but they can't have me take them early or late because it runs the risk of cheating. Whatever. Dispite explain things to my mom, she doesn't understand that I am an adult now and I have obligations other than my family. I think it's harder for her there because previously, I worked as a PCA (personal care assistant) for both my sister and my brother, and could help out more than I can now.\n\nI have offered to try and get a plane ticket for part of the trip, as the rest of my family is taking a transit van down, adding 5 extra days of just travel to the trip (we're from Minnesota). I can't really afford to do this, but either way, this isn't a good enough option for her either. \n\nAnyways, now that I've finally stated officially that I can't go, she is being super passive aggressive and mean every time I reach out. Even if I'm trying to help her in other ways, like offer to watch the dogs while they're gone, as it's expensive to board.

Answer the question and classify your answers into yes or no.", "input": "Is OTHER wrong in the post ? POST : **Set-Up and Dynamics**\n\nWell, it\u2019s been a semester. So my housing is unique. I am a freshman/junior (came in with AA), who lives in campus housing with a freshman and a senior. All three of us have specialized housing as a part of a local program. We all qualified, as all three of us have a form of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Our housing is not too shabby. We live in one of the newest buildings on campus. This campus has rooms set up like this: All three of us (normally four but there isn\u2019t enough ASD girls in our program) share a long hallway. On each end of the hallway is a bathroom we share with the closest room to it. (A &amp; B share one bathroom and C &amp; D share a bathroom). I am in A, the freshman roommate I\u2019m having issues with lives in B, and the senior roommate I live with lives in C. We\u2019ll refer to them by they\u2019re room letters for now on.\n\nC and I get along great. C is the same major as me so we bonded over that, occasionally going to lunch together and I helped her find a tutor once. C plays loud music and likes dancing in her room. Sometimes I ask her to tune it down just a bit and she\u2019s respectful of it. Never had a problem aside from that, C is cool. It\u2019s funny, my original academic advisor said I probably wouldn\u2019t be good friends with C.\n\nB and I don\u2019t get along. It\u2019s a shame, she reminds me of someone I once mentored and she reminds me a lot of myself. I tried to be her friend at the beginning of the semester, asking if she\u2019d like to come to the university gardens, campus events, or have lunch. After being rejected every time, I stopped. It\u2019s clear she didn\u2019t want to go out and I can respect that. I too had pretty severe social anxiety stemming from my ASD, so I get she\u2019s just not there. I leave her be. A lot of people call her a \u2018hermit\u2019 which I have mixed feelings about.\n\n**Prior**\n\nAll three of us have signed a roommate agreement as requirement for living in our dorms. I clean the floors every week, mop them every month, and perform miscellaneous task like cleaning toilets, cleaning mold from the shower, and picking up or fixing anything where there\u2019s an issue. B is in charge of cleaning our four glass mirrors (two in each bathroom) and taking out the trash bins (in each bathroom). C, being a senior and having motor issues, wipes down the three countertops in the hallway. Cleaning of our own rooms and such is left at our own discrecion.  We all agreed we wanted the shared space \u201cclean\u201d but not spotless.\n\nOf the three of us I am the most social. I have about four friends and a significant other. So practically, I\u2019m the only one who ever has guest over. The only guest consistently over is my s/o, the others have only come once or twice during the daytime. So when it came to agreements about how long members of the opposite sex can stay over and whether we should let eachother know when s/o\u2019s are coming over, I let them talk. They said they needed zero notice and to make sure they leave \u201cat a reasonable hour\u201d. Considering a lot of curfews end at midnight, I generally believed that before this is what\u2019s considered a reasonable hour. My boyfriend takes night classes and works during the day, so unfortunately I only get to see him kinda late in the night. Generally beginning at 8:30 and he tends to leave 10:00 or 11:00 at max.\n\nI\u2019m a gamer. I have a decent PC build and am a student athlete for one of our esports teams. My job is shot caller, so when I play the specific game for esports, I have to talk. I tend to talk in a monotone but happy voice. I\u2019m often described as a flight attendant. Considering I have to speak for matches on end, I can\u2019t afford to scream or yell. My voice is generally speaking level for a typical person when playing the game, as my normal voice is soft.\n\n**Inciting Incident**\n\nTwo or three weeks ago the leader (L) of our program offhandedly mentioned that B had been complaining about C and I making too much noise. I felt bad, I don\u2019t want B to be frustrated or irritated in our dorm. I know it\u2019s hard for B to speak up. I thought being proactive was the best way to go because I didn\u2019t want B to suffer in silence. So I had been brainstorming solutions on how to fix it. I had already modified myself pretty significantly before but with mixed signals.\n\nI\u2019m living on my own for the first time and a night owl. So as with any first year college student, my sleep is a wreck. I am often up during the day or late working on assignments. Weeks went by where the only time I got to game was during my esports practice. The most egregious incidents where on three separate non-consecutive occasions I had stayed up practicing the game. I was careful to keep my voice down, but it probably slipped to that typical level a few times. I guess that\u2019s where the majority of complaints came from. So I toned it down, trying to play single player games if it\u2019s past 12-1 o\u2019clock or ones where I don\u2019t have to talk. Occasionally I heat up food with the microwave in my room, but I always set it to have 1 extra second so the timer doesn\u2019t go off. I try to be courteous since I know it\u2019s probably irritating to have a roomate up at that time. I don\u2019t leave my room unless I absolutely have to (such as for shower or to use the restroom) if it is past 12:30. Considering my roommate and I agreed she\u2019d get shower for all of 8, it takes an hour for hot water to come back full, so I shower at 10. This is why I sometimes have to leave later than typical for shower, especially if my boyfriend is with me before.\n\nB had been starting to get on my nerves for a while now. She\u2019s generally quiet, but doesn\u2019t abide by our roommate for cleaning duties. She\u2019s completely her duties in their entirety only once. She usually only does trash and even neglects that sometimes. It\u2019s irritating I have to spend extra time cleaning, especially since I cleaned our dorm alone for the entire first month. It\u2019s a minor complaint so I\u2019d mention it to my executive function councilor once or twice but it\u2019s not a big enough issue to warrant more than a sticky note reminding her to clean.\n\nAnyways, back to brainstorming. So aside from some behavioral adjustments like I listed above, I didn\u2019t really know what else to do. I remember reading about a Gorilla at Rotterdam Zoo once who would become upset if humans looked it in the eye, which inspired me for the next solution. A redditor once said that it would be easier to modify the structure of the gorillas exhibit than a behavioral change. So I rolled with that.I thought maybe moving B to the empty  room D would be the equivalent of this structural change. C could chose whether or not she\u2019d move to B or stay in C. I emailed L, asking if it was a fair idea and if so that if I should go ahead and ask housing if it was even possible. From there I would have had a meeting with the roomates to ask whether or not they\u2019d like to try it.\n\n**The Response**\n\nL, bless their heart, ruined everything and has made these past two weeks hell for me. L had (without me knowing) received a very frustrating phone call before she went to read my email about the solution. She instead referred it to her second in command (M) to take care of. L also said some blatantly untrue and exaggerated statements of behaviors in this situation for M to address. I honestly don\u2019t know where they came from, whether L heard them from B\u2019s councilors or B\u2019s parents.\n\nM went on a bloodbath email. M specified absurd claims:\n\n* \u201cA\u2019s guests playing games late into the night at loud volumes\u201d (I only own a PC, can\u2019t play games w/ people in person)\u201d\n* \u201cB can\u2019t sleep because A has company over at 2:00am and is constantly loud, that\u2019s unfair and obnoxious\u201d\n* \u201cthe cleaning schedule includes things that may be considered either inappropriate or unfair. According to B, individuals are responsible for cleaning up regardless of who caused the mess.\u201d. M told me later in a private meeting he also thought this meant cleaning dishes and cleaning each others rooms. None of us use silverware or flatware (all plastic for convenience) and none of us have ever entered each others rooms without the other being there.\n\nM stated they \u201cwill not be calling out specific individuals or who said what in order to keep things civil\u201d then proceeded to only mention me by name. The instances of where I put A and B in the above bullets were from the obvious deduction of who raised the concerns against who. I double checked to make sure it wasn\u2019t C before being certain, she stated she\u2019s never had any problems from either of us roommates. The most egregious and upsetting part of M\u2019s email was when he referred to \u201caccording to various sources and observations, conflicts are being \u201cmediated\u201d by A. What the mediations apparently boil down to is A telling everyone what needs to be done and who is responsible for doing it. This has been interpreted as bossy, aggressive, intimidating, and dominating.\u201d I was deeply hurt by the personal insults.\n\nI was told by my original councilor how hard it was for my roomates to speak up. During our roommate agreement, 20-30 seconds of pure silence would pass until I\u2019d end it by speaking up. I feel I\u2019ve awarded every fair opportunity for my roomates to speak in person. If they don\u2019t want to do that, we all each have each others personal numbers to communicate through text. I\u2019ve used this system a few times, telling them about how one week I couldn\u2019t clean because I went home sick, one time when my grandmother was coming on Saturday (both go home for the weekend but I thought I should let them know just incase), and once or twice to ask if they wanted any of the croissants my boyfriend regularly brings me. I\u2019ve tried my hardest to make sure there\u2019s a platform for them, but when shit hits the fan I tend to get things done. When no ones done chores by Friday, I\u2019ll do them all.

Not the most scandalous either, but enough to start a disagreement with my wife. \n\n*Obligatory: on mobile, sorry for formatting. Also not a throwaway account because people should be comfortable owning their quirky and weird thoughts and stories. TL/DR at bottom.\n\n\nBackground:\n-It's currently winter where we live and it's cold out today (in the 30's\u00b0F).\n-We like to support local businesses whenever possible.\n-Our town has one really good small business bagel shop that has been aroumd for years and we love their bacon/cheddar cream cheese and unique lox spread.\n-The bagel shop doesn't have indoor seating.\n-Two store fronts down a new coffeehouse opened up. It has your typical coffeehouse hipster vibe and more importantly indoor seating.\n-I prefer to not eat or drink in my car because I feel it's an unneeded distraction while driving, I don't get to enjoy the food/drink as much, and it usually makes a mess.\n\n\nSituation:\n-My wife went to the new coffeehouse on a weekday morning off to do school work and enjoyed it.\n-That night she suggested we go get bagels from the bagel shop and then coffee at the coffeehouse that weekend.\n-Last weekend we do just that. Get our bagels and head to the coffeehouse for coffee. We have no issues; drink our coffee and eat our bagels at the coffeehouse. \n-Having had a great experience we leave thinking, \"what a nice Sunday treat, let's do it again next weekend.\"\n-This weekend we again get our bagels and head to coffeehouse. After ordering and promptly paying for the coffee (with tip), before the coffee is poured, I tell the owner we would like to drink it there. The owner (who was there last weekend, although he didn't personally serve us) tells us us we can't eat outside food in his coffeehouse because they serve breakfast sandwiches and pastries (no bagels). He does this by saying something to that effect while simultaneously (I felt somewhat rudely) showing us the menu. We politely say, \"O, ok. To-go then.\" Nowhere is this policy posted on the menu or in the coffeehouse.\n-After we get our coffee and are heading out the door, I quietly tell my wife I'd rather not come back to the coffeehouse because they won't let us eat our bagels there.\n-Although we both prefer bagels to the coffeehouse's menu offerings this aggravates my wife. \n-I'm disappointed too because I like the coffeehouse coffee.\n-We take our coffees and go back home to eat, which breaks up our morning errands plan.\n\n\nMy thoughts: \n1. We bought coffee there, why can't we enjoy it there, even if we do have outside food? It's not like we brought our bagels in just to sit, eat, and use the wifi while not ordering anything.\n2. The owner could have said you can eat outside food here this time, but please no more outside food after today. (Especially because we did it last week and there was no mention of this policy then). I mean c'mon do you expect us to throw the breakfast we already bought away to order more stuff from your coffeehouse?? And call me unreasonable, but I'm not going to drink my coffee there and not eat a perfectly good bagel until later because of a policy I didn't know about.\n3. Other people there bought only a coffee and were allowed to drink it there without purchasing food.  What gives?\n4. What if we had a food allergy and couldn't eat the food they served there? Then could I bring my own or outside food?\n5. There are other local coffeehouses that allow outside food, we could just go there.\n\n\nA few aggravating asides:\n-Bought two coffees and wife only got one frequent customer punchcard punch. For those counting at home, she now has four punches, lol.\n-My wife spilled her hot coffee on her while in the car. She's fine and car is ok too. (Thank you bagel shop for a paper towel roll's amount of napkins)\n-My wife also spilled the coffee on her at our house while sitting on the couch. She again was fine, was just another thing to clean.\n\nWIBTA: For not wanting to go back to the local coffeehouse?\n\nTL/DR: New local coffeehouse has a (not posted) no outside food policy and wouldn't let us drink our coffee there because we had purchased bagels (which they don't serve) from two shops down.

They started giving me information about how unhealthy it was to only eat apples, and growing increasingly exasperated by it. Some of them even got angry.\n\nBut I wanted to stick with the joke. Finally, after the end of 3 weeks, I walked into what I was told was a movie night but was actually an intervention for me. \n\nThey were all super concerned about my well being and had all sorts of information or whatever. Finally I started laughing hysterically. They were confused as hell so I told them I had been faking it the whole time and had been eating real meals outside their knowledge. I even took out some beef jerky from my pant pocket to prove it and munched it. \n\nI thought they'd appreciate the joke but they were actually really annoyed. My girlfriend even broke up with me over this because a few days ago I had ruined our date night when I told the waiter I only wanted apples because I was an Appletarian and had \"embarrassed her for a dumb joke\". \n\nIn my opinion the joke was solid and they should appreciate my commitment to the prank. \n\nBut, did I go too far?\n\n", "output": "yes", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

We had been playing for an hour and a half when he\u2019s like \u201cI don\u2019t want to play anymore\u201d and left the game. He told me we could still call and talk but he just didn\u2019t want to play. At first I was like why not and tried to get him to play again, but he told me he was tired and planning on sleeping soon. I respected that so I stopped playing and asked if we could FaceTime for a few min before he went to sleep. I just wanted to see him because I barely saw him all day as we both had a pretty busy day. He declined and again told me he was tired and cut me off by saying good night. I tried to reason with him and brought up how minutes ago he literally told me we could talk.

He then tells me that I\u2019m not respecting him and how tired he is because he had a long day (totally ignoring that I also had a long day) and asks if he really said we could talk as if I just made it up or something. We continue to argue about it for a while and he calls me clingy and problematic which is totally uncalled for. He also claims that we never FaceTime for a few minutes which is false because we\u2019ve literally done it before. \n\nI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m asked for a lot here, just a few minutes on FaceTime is all.

Buckle up:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile on a working holiday a few months ago, I broke my ankle.  I moved from my guesthouse into a hostel upon the recommendation of a friend, because they had crutches and a wheelchair available for guests (much, MUCH cheaper than renting those items from the local hospital).  \n\nAt the hostel I met several long term guests who were working/studying on the island, including another American who was very helpful when I couldn't walk at all.  She was there for weird missionary purposes, but was still pretty young and cool and only made me slightly uncomfortable by talking about Jesus every once in a while.  I genuinely liked her.  She picked stuff up for me from the convenience store next door and accompanied me to the hospital during one of my visits, as well as to the airport.\n\nI had made my travel plans before the accident and I was supposed to be taking a trip to another country in Asia.  I decided that I would go there to get my surgery since it was MUCH cheaper there than the place I was staying.  I already had a plane ticket leaving from another city.  But I could no longer take a long bus or train ride in my condition.  To make things worse I couldn't purchase a plane ticket to that city because I forgot my mastercard securecode (I STILL have to figure that out, because my bank was no help at all and every time I try to call mastercard through skype it's a shitshow.  Thanks mastercard!)\n\nANYWAY this girl was very nice &amp; purchased the $60 ticket for me and I sent her $100 on paypal because I knew there might be another problem.  Sure enough there was another problem though.  When she accompanied me to the hospital (I needed to get blood thinners to board a flight to avoid getting a blood clot in my leg) it turned out to be more expensive than the hospital had told me over the phone (because they'd only told me the cost of the shot- not the cost of the obligatory 2 minute \"consultation\" with their fancy bone doctor).  So I gave her the cash I had on me and she paid for the rest with her card (about $30 or $40).\n\nSo at this point I'd sent her $100 and she'd paid around $100 for me.\n\nAnyway this whole time we were at the hostel she told me she knew some people who had helped her a great deal when she was staying in the country I was travelling to.  They were locals who could help me get around, translate for me and get things for me for small fees.\n\nI always sort of rebuffed her though as I had already done a great deal of research and was pretty sure I could handle initial things on my own &amp; could likely find paid helpers if I needed to through expat grounds on fb.\n\nShe contacted them on her own and gave them my fb, told them to meet me at the airport.\n\nShe asked me if this was ok and I just said \"ok\" despite major misgivings, because I was tired and thought the worst that could happen would be an overpriced taxi from the airport.  I'd like to add that I genuinely think she thought she was helping.\n\nAnyway, I want to make this short: these guys were awful.  They tried to make me stay in a hotel with a lot of stairs and I was like \"no I can't fucking walk, what the hell?\" and then they were like \"there aren't any guesthouses without stairs\" so I got out the research I'd done and told them 2 and went to 1 and sure enough got a ground floor room.  They told me they were accompanying me to one hospital I'd researched, but actually brought me to another much worse one that they said would be much cheaper (it wasn't.  They just knew people who'd worked there).  I was stupid and felt unsure and unsafe and went along with things, but after the surgery the nurses kept telling me I was going to get robbed and/or raped if I stayed there without anyone accompanying me overnight so I ended up getting a random couchsurfer to come over (seriously he was a saint, what a nice guy).\n\nAnyway the 2 guys who accompanied me everywhere started hassling me for cash and I ended up having to give them $50 each.  To be fair, they had helped me somewhat, but only with situations they had put me in.  For example, the terrible hospital had no elavator and the orthopedic surgeon was on the 4th floor.  So with a bunch of doctors they carried me in the wheelchair up the damn stairs.  But like...I was only in that situation because of them.\n\nAnyway months later the girl asked me to send her more money, because she apparently forgot I gave her cash at the hospital to cover the shot (but not the doctor's consultation).  I gladly gave it to her anyway.  \\*She\\* genuinely helped me.  But the guys she knew here did NOT.  AT ALL.  They never got things I requested, gave me false information and always made me feel scared for my safety (and I mean I'm a solo female traveller who has lived &amp; travelled all over Europe, the Middle East &amp; Asia...I'm pretty good at gauging my safety in different situations).\n\nWhen I tried to bring this to her attention while it was happening, she would always say something about \"Jesus putting us through trials\" or \"Everything will work out in the end thanks to Jesus.\"  I strongly disagree and want to block her.  But do I still owe her anything?  Should I stay connected to her on social media in case I can potentially help her one day?  Do I owe her an explanation?

He was looking for new work for a while but caught wind from his superiors (who he is in good standing with) that he\u2019s the next in line to move up. This means he could get off 3rd shift and make a lot more money, which he really needs right now.\n\nLast week my boyfriend was asked to work 3 days of 1st shift at a second location this upcoming week. They didn\u2019t tell him why but he jumped on the opportunity. He theorizes that they\u2019ll looking for a new supervisor at this second location and they can use this chance to see how well he works there. He asks me if I can make sure he\u2019s up at 8:30-9 Monday morning and I figure sure, no problem, I\u2019m always up by then anyway.\n\nFor some relevant information, he was up at 10am Sunday then went to work at 9pm, then came back home at about 4am and went to bed shortly after. Both our alarms go off at the same time at 8:30am but he cannot be woken up. He is the heaviest sleeper I have ever met, he will sleep through natural disasters if he\u2019s tired enough. I try to get him up and all I get is snapped at to \u201cfuck off\u201d. I go give myself some space and at a little after 9 I try again. He\u2019s coherent enough to tell me that he isn\u2019t bothering, he absolutely cannot get up and be functional right now.\n\nOn one hand, I know that being awake for so long has to be very hard and switching schedules is even harder, and since his job involves operating heavy machinery he had a point. But on the other hand I\u2019m so upset because he need a promotion. He lives paycheck to paycheck and I\u2019m happy to chip in more since I make more (we live together) but I\u2019m about to have new car payments and I would like to see him start saving. We\u2019ve been talking about moving and potentially my going back to grad school and we both agreed that can\u2019t happen until he has a better position. He could have just ruined his chances.\n\nTLDR: Boyfriend slept through an opportunity to look good for a potential promotion at work. He didn\u2019t sleep in because he is lazy, he slept in because he worked an 8 hour shift after being up for 12 hours before that. It\u2019s not my job or my life but I\u2019m still mad anyway because we\u2019re stuck in a rut until he advances in his career.

POST : A bit of backstory: He and his gf moved recently and I helped them a couple days to renovate their new place and get their stuff into their new home. He was also unhappy with his current job (truck driver) and since he was always interested in computers I started teaching him programming and got him an apprenticeship at the company I work at.\n\nAfter above mentioned things were dealt with, everyday life began to settle in again and I'd frequently visit him as usual. The difference now is that we don't have a dedicated room to chill in and play video games together and talk about private matters. Everything is now in the living room, with his gf visibly annoyed and more people visiting now since a good friend lives in the same apartment complex, so things get a lot easier heated nowadays.\n\nI'll be moving into a new place in 2 months and asked my friend if he wanted to help me with planning the apartment and such since he is experienced with that. He said yes and we waited until the floor plans arrived. \nI asked him multiple times when we wanted to go to some furniture places together to get some ideas (I wanted him to come with me since I want to make one of the rooms I'll have our dedicated place again, but this time I wanted it to be like a thing we designed and made together). He postponed the date when we would go multiple times because he either forgot it or wanted to stay home because he \"doesn't like to go to furniture places and just wants to chills at home\", which got me a little mad yesterday because he's on sick leave since two weeks (he isn't sick) and has been playing games since then (which imo is perfectly fine, but weakens his argument of wanting to chill imo).\n\nAs soon as another friend came in and got wind about that we want to go to a furniture place, he immediately said that we should totally go now, but then realised it's late so we should go the next day then.\n\nI later called him out because that's not the first time this happened (like I asked him for something to do outside, he says no, but as soon as someone else would join, he says yes) and told him that I sort of feel disrespected as if I wasn't good enough of a reason to do something outside of his comfort zone.\n\nHe just replied \"dude, seriously?\" and now I'm sitting here wondering if I was wrong and the asshole for getting mad and / or overreacting or he is.\n\nI hope someone takes their time to read and reply to this.

POST : I'll get this out of the way, I feel like an incredible asshole here, but maybe it's one of those things where she's overreacting a bit. I honestly don't know and maybe it doesn't matter because we have to move on one way or another. \n\n\nSo backstory on this, fianc\u00e9 grew up in smallish mountain town north of Albuquerque, NM as did her parents and both sets of grandparents. Both grandparents got engaged in the town plaza because it was sort of the thing to do back in the day. Her parents also got engaged in the plaza but in a much more informal \"hippieish\" manner in the 70s, but it was still the same location. \n\n\nWhen we seriously started talking about marriage she told me flat out (to paraphrase) \"I don't care about the ring, I don't care about you asking my dad for 'permission', I don't care how much you spend, what time of year it is or if it's freezing outside; I want you to propose in the Taos Plaza.\" I was like cool...I can do that. \n\n\nSo we've been talking about rings for maybe the last six months and I finally bought one that I feel definitely fit her personality. I stupidly told her best friend and best friend told her. So last weekend we decided to spend the weekend in her hometown skiing. As the weekend came to a close I could tell she was getting antsier and antsier but it honestly didn't clue in what the deal was. As we drove past the plaza on the way back to Albuquerque she even said \"he look, it's the plaza...we should stop!\"\n\n\nBecause I'm an IDIOT it didn't clue me in what she was talking about and I was the good computer engineer and said something like \"no, no we have a schedule to keep, work tomorrow!\" So the whole way home she was that kind of like mad/sad and wasn't really talking to me. I figured she was tired and didn't make much of it. \n\n\nSo next day I saw her best friend at work (she works with me) and she basically said that I really blew it because girlfriend was expecting me to propose on the trip. In an a-ha moment I was like that's what she was mad. So I took her out to a nice dinner Tuesday night and got on one knee and proposed to her in a restaurant. She said yes  but I could tell she was still really upset. I asked her what was wrong and she very openly told me (again paraphrasing) \"I love you and want to marry you, but for almost a year and half I've told you I want one thing and one thing only from my proposal and it's goin to take me a long time to not be upset that you didn't listen to me.\" \n\n\nSo the moment that was supposed to symbolize the start of our new life together ended with her taking most of her food home in a doggy bag, leaving to her apartment by herself and her telling me \"I really love you, but I'm really upset and I need some time before I see you again\" and kissing me on the cheek. I know she'll come around but I don't know when. \n\n\nSo I full on acknowledge I'm an idiot, but am I an asshole?", "output": "yes", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

All in all the relationship ended last September, but only just realised now that I can't win her back. During this time I managed to win her back, move back in with her and my son, to then make a mistake and be thrown out again. So I own the place where we both work. It's soley in my name as it was my business. She has helped out, worked with me and my intention was always to make it our business by getting her name on the place too. Well, after all of this happening, she has walked out once on the business before and left me in the shit so to speak, had to employ someone else to take over her role within the company. I moved out, into my friends unoccupied house, then into my own flat. After realising that I can't do everything, I couldn't pay for myself, for my employee, for all her rent, food, bills and all my sons needs, I asked her to come back and work with me. During this time she was working a job that she earnt little to no money and couldn't cover basic needs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe comes back to work with me, we manage to make the business stable. I let her take over the finances to which I don't think she did a good enough job of.

After not really knowing how to approach anything with her, still kinda thinking we could at least do things as a family, which I was wrong to presume. I had a really bad day where I couldn't even function properly, asked her if I could stay at hers and talk and go through some things, which we kind of did.

I was really into A but it never went anywhere and kind of fizzled out.

POST : I want to preface this post by first saying that along with all of you here, i love my mom. I want to know AITA  and if so how i could help her better.\n\nMy mom is the sweetest person i have ever met, and a phenomenal woman. I am proud of her in so many ways. She is loving, and is always one to hold everyone together. She is my biggest supporter. Without her advice i would not be half the person i am today. I owe her so much. She is the matriarch of our family. \nShe works a fairly difficult job during the night, taking care of elderly folk @ a nursing home as a CNA. For the entire 25 yrs i have been alive this was her line of work. \n\nMany people have hobbies, and ways that they blow off steam, and for my mom her hobby unfortunately (from my pov) is spending her time and money @ the casino.\n\nI don't think that gambling is bad outright, but like many things, an excessive amount of anything can prove to be detrimental. \n\nOver the last decade i have seen her hobby do more harm than good. Again from my own pov.\n\nFor as much as i love my mom, it seems like the reason our family has been in a financial rut is because of my moms inability to discipline herself over her gambling habits. \n\nMy dad is an electrician, and makes very good money. Enough for them to own their own home, but there are times where she would actually take money out of my dads wallet, then proceed to work the slots or bingo cards at the casino. It has been an issue that our family has tried to address time &amp; time again but only seems to get worse. \n\nEvery confrontation has ended in false promises, denial, and a sense that this is a habit that will continue to get worse if professional help is not sought after.\n\nThere was a point where we lost our storage unit that had personal family effects, like Christmas decorations gathered over the years since me and my siblings were babies, family photo albums, furniture, personal belongings, etc. Things that were special to us were all of a sudden sold off in that unit because she couldn't foot the bill that month. I would of helped, but i was away @ college and no knowledge of this until i came home for Christmas break only to find why all decorations and tree weren't set up. Dad couldn't pay it off either because the money that was supposed to foot the bill... went to you guessed it... my moms casino outings. That was a tough christmas. My mom of course apologized endlessly, but she even stated that they were just \"material\" possessions.\n\n To this day i am still bitter. \n\nMy dad has confronted her about her habit, but he rationalizes her decision to go out to the casino as her \"me time\", and that in order to have a happy home, you have to have a happy wife. My mom states that when she goes to bingo nights it makes her happy, and fulfilled. I am deeply disturbed, and crushed that my own mother has to resort to gambling her money away to feel good. \n\nMy parents actually sought out a financial guru to help solve some of their financial situations. Although reluctant, it was eventually revealed that my mom has an issue with her gambling. After some rough calculations, even the guru believed that with all the money my parents make, they could do away with their all their debt, within the next 5-7 yrs and habe raised their credit enough to be homeowners, but if her outings continue, they will forever stay where they are. \n\nMy mom felt committed. And she was adamant to make changes. A month went by, but eventually she was right back where she always wanted to be. At the casino.\n\nShe used to ask me for money to help pay the rent, and i always gave her money, but then i found out that at one point she gambled with it, and lost. I felt betrayed. \n\nSince then i don't trust her with money. \n\nIt hurts to understand that the woman who has always been there for you, raised you, clothed you, fed you, put a roof over your head, and taught you, has an issue. \n\nIt was only when i turned 22 when things got worse, did i realize that mom is not who i thought she was. I always held her in such high regard as a child, but the level of respect for her has lowered a bit. I am ashamed to say that. But thats my truth.\n\n Is it wrong of me to think that? I do understand that no one is perfect. We are human. Everyone has vices. Me included. But i can't help but feel ashamed yet so frustrated that she gives in to those slot machines and bingo cards. \n\nWhen i confront her about it,  admittedly sometimes i go off the rails. I don't raise my voice, but i feel a sense of pity mixed with a loss of respect when addressing the issue. I don't like talking to her about it, so i usually avoid the topic altogether, unless i catch her dressed up ready to leave and she asks me for $20. I have no words.\n\nAITA for not giving her money? Or for confronting her about her gambling issue? Should i leave her be? Idk what to do. \n\n\n\n", "output": "no", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

This is mainly due to the fact that all my friends have gone back to university due to classes starting on the 7th on January. Because I am on a co-op term, I have to stay in my home city which is hours away from my university. Basically, I'll have no friends to hang out with this year. \n\nBut y'see, I joined this nifty online Discord community so I thought that I would still be able to spend time with some close online friends. Unfortunately for me, many of them are also busy with school and exams and whatnot. However, one of my closer friends, let's refer to her as Sam, doesnt study a lot and spends most of her time playing League of Legends, which I also play with her often. So my birthday hits, I finish work and get home at 7pm where I expect to find Sam online. I see her playing some League of Legends as expected and I ask if she wants to play with me after I finish dinner. She agrees so I promptly head out to dinner so I can finish quicker and have time to play with her. Note: I sleep at 10:30pm due to an early work schedule and Sam is aware of this fact.\n\nSo I finish my birthday dinner and am heading back at around 8pm. I message her to reconfirm that she's available to play with me once I get home. She confirms this fact and I head home. So I get home at around 8:20 and I give Sam a call. She doesn't pick up so I wait in the empty call by myself for a couple minutes before me messages me saying that she will be home in a bit. I'm a bit taken aback by this because I wasn't even aware that she had gone out. So I just so \"ok\" and go watch some youtube for a bit. So fast forward half an hour and Sam has not messaged me since. I ask her what's up and she says she's still not home yet. At around 9pm, she finally msgs me to tell me she's home so I give her a call and get prepared to spend the rest of the day playing some League of Legends with Sam. Before she picks up she messages me \"if ur too tired you can sleep and we can play another time\". I'm completely dumbstruck by that statement and I got the impression that she lowkey didnt want to play so I quickly hang up the call. She notices that and tries to recover by saying \"Oh unless you want to play today\" but I'm not having any of it. Her lack of apologies for being late, lack of notice for her absence, and implying I sleep off my birthday pissed me off. I log off discord and am in such a bad state that I go to get some alcohol. It seems a bit pathetic but I was lonely and bored so I didn't really care at that point that I was drinking alone. Sam calls my phone a couple times and I ignore them and continue drinking because at that point we would only be able to squeeze 2 or 3 games in and in the mood I was in they wouldn't be any fun anyways. So I spent the rest of the day drinking my sorrows away.\n\nI wake up today and log back in on discord and I get a message from Sam saying \"let's play league today!\". I tell her I wanted to play league yesterday but she replies saying that it was my fault we didn't play League because I ignored her calls and whatnot. We argue for a bit with her saying I misunderstood her message and me just getting pissed at her for what she did yesterday.

We were literally second to last row and these nosebleeds are so high that you're looking down at the stage. If someone in front of you stands up, you literally can't see anything but the rafters.\n\nFor some background, this was Fleetwood Mac. There were many age ranges. Mostly, however, there were older people (70s, seriously) and several of them I heard complaining about knees hurting and such. So the concert begins and literally nobody except those down in the general admission against the stage itself are standing because old people and you can't see shit and most people are being courteous.\n\nNow, let me say that I understand people want to stand at concerts and I am all for it given certain circumstances but you have to gauge your audience and the venue. Literally NO ONE in the upper bowl was standing.\n\nSo, about four songs into the concert these three young girls come late and don't sit down. I let it go for a moment, but they're directly in front of me and I can't see shit. So I gently tap the girl directly in front of me and say, \"Excuse me, but when you stand up like that, I can't see anything.\" She immediately gets aggressive. \"So, what?! I'm not allowed to stand up at all during the concert?!?!\" I said, \"Literally no one else around you is standing. There are older people here who can't stand this long, and nobody behind you can see.\" At this point she turns to the people around us and starts asking rudely, \"Can y'all see?!?! I think you can see!\" And after a moment, one older guy in the row behind me just goes, \"NO!\"\n\nSo she sits down. This happened during my all time favorite Fleetwood Mac song, so now I am pissed that the song is ruined. I'm trying to enjoy myself and let go of my anger. She obviously can't let it go, because almost a minute later she whirls around and goes, \"THERE ARE MUCH BETTER WAYS YOU COULD HAVE SAID THAT TO ME!!\" and I said, \"I'm not getting into this with you. Turn around!\"\n\nShe didn't take it any further. The next four songs, they were scoping out empty lower bowl seats and eventually left to go steal some.. which I was more than okay with. However, the more I thought about it, the more I wondered if I was being unreasonable asking her to sit down. I mean, it IS a concert. \n\nIf you're looking DOWN at the stage, I feel it's rude to stand and completely obscure the people behind you, especially when no one else is standing. I can understand standing if you're eye level to the stage or looking up at it, or if it's general admission. \n\nIDK. The older man agreeing that he couldn't see either made me feel a little validated, plus the fact that she immediately got aggressive which means she was expecting someone to say something.. but, maybe I should have just kept my mouth shut and stood up (thus obscuring more people's views) myself.", "output": "no", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

There was a non-relative woman who took her in and who became her mother figure. This quasi-MIL seemed nice to me, but behind my back, she was telling lies to her entire family, like that I never paid rent after moving in with Lara and that I only liked her because of her money. She started trying to convince my gf to leave me. Lara didn't tell me about this for months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMIL claimed that Lara has become like her second daughter, but while she always made sure that her real daughter had enough time to study, she never gave a shit about Lara's education. Lara instead was asked to do an unappropriate amount of chores at home, that literally kept her from studying. Lara didn't even get to go to the same prestigious school as the real daughter did. Still, Lara felt thankful to have a family in them that she even paid them rent and bought their groceries in order to not be a nuisance. So these things Lara confided in me. It was her own idea to pay the rent and groceries, and she never saw anything wrong with doing all the chores. She never noticed how weird it all was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter months of MIL's campaign against me, Lara had a long conversation with her quasi-mother, telling her she'll spend the rest of her life with me, and if MIL doesn't accept that, she'll only play a minor role in the life of her future quasi-grandchildren. From then on, our relationship improved a little.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen, a friend told me what had been happening behind my back prior to my gf's conversation with MIL (which I didn't know about). It sounded like it was still going on. I asked Lara about it, and she confirmed that MIL had said and done all these things. I wrote MIL and told her I knew about her trying to split us up, and about the rent lies. I said that she's a hypocrite to say that because she didn't treat Lara like a second daughter, she treated her like a slave.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter my rant, MIL just blocked my number and sent Lara screenshots. Lara was angry , she said that the arguments I used were things that never had bothered her herself.

MIL went low contact with Lara until a small unrelated fight, when she broke off all contact. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSometimes I wonder if I should just have not said anything at all to MIL and just not have come along anymore when Lara visited her.

POST : To start off with i will say that this is not me in case, it's my friend/classmate and i will apologise in advance for my broken english as it is my second language.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk a bit of backstory, so we are 17/18 years old and at second grade of college/high school. there is this kind of a tradition to celebrate the third graders/seniors leaving the school that we celebrate it by hosting them a party and buying all the alcohol and food for them. and also there is another tradition going on about the same time now that the second graders have this oldish event in which we have a lot of old dances that we train and then there will be our big day to show off everyone how good of dancers we are.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the thing is that we have also a party after our dance in the evening and usually people drink quite a lot in there and we have to pay for everything collectively beforehand. And now that we are planning both for the party of the seniors leaving and our party after the dances. we came to a conclusion that everyone should pay 20 euros so we can pay for both. And if you didn't want to take part in our party after the dance you just wouldn't pay 10 euros and not come to the party, And also if you didn't want to pay for the seniors goodbye party then you just wouldnt be able to join next year when the current second graders would pay for you. quite simple.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now we are at the point where everything is basically figured out and done. But my friend has strong beliefs against alcoholism and didn't want to support the drinking or drink himself.  I of course assumed that he would just pay his part on everything else since the was a good planning for budget and all expenses were figured out so he just wouldn't pay his part for the alcohol costs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is  where is was really surprised that almost everyone started to scream to him that just pay the fucking 20euros and get this done with and don't fuck around. he explained that he just felt that he wouldn't like to part of supporting heavy drinking and just not pay for the alcohol and not drink it by himself now or the next year when we get the party. even after he gave a proper explanation  people still talked shit about him that \"always like this, never willing to co-operate\" which is partially true but in this matter I couldn't really understand why he wouldn't be able to just pay his part of the other costs like rent and food. And people kept telling him that just pay the fucking 20 euros and we can use it to buy foor and not alcohol so everyone will be happy, but as obviously terrible argument as that is because simply there would be more money to buy alcohol since someone else wouldn't pay for the food and buy more alcohol which would still support heavy drinking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI most often can relate to other views or atleast understand them but in this case i truly can't understand why wouldn't he be able to just pay his part in other costs so he would just be able to join the party and not dring because i was basically the only one that got his back. so is my friend truly an asshole?

I wouldn't say we're really friends but in general we're friendly with each other.   \n      \nHowever, as of late, he's honestly been REALLY pissing me off. The reason is because he's VERY often online gaming -- which I wouldn't mind -- but he's ALWAYS talking to his friends over voice chat. So my room is very rarely quiet. For context, I'd say he's on voice chat at least 3 hours a day, if not more (most I've seen is like 8). I have nothing against him or the games he plays or whatever but this behavior just REALLY pisses me off because it means my room is never quiet.         \n           \nObviously I can just put on headphones, but the room is small enough that I can still hear him if I don't blast the music (which I don't want to do for my ear's sake).    \n      \nThe other solution is of course just to go study somewhere else -- which is often what I end up doing. But this pisses me off because I have 2 extra monitors in my room which make me MUCH more productive; so whenever I have to leave my room for some quiet, I lose that extra productivity. He hasn't seemed to notice that I almost always leave when he gets online with his friend. I guess he doesn't notice that the I always take the trash out too, as he's never done it.         \n        \nIt just pisses me off. Honestly it makes me physically grind my teeth when I hear him start chatting with his friend, and once I think I punched my desk. I know that sounds like some stupid shit, I acknowledge that. But that's what happened.\n      \nTo his credit, in all other respects he is a perfectly fine roommate. Relatively clean, quiet (*when he's not gaming*), pretty personable.

I used to live in the countryside where there was a lot of space for sports and other activities for my friends and I. However, recently I moved to a dense city where there is no space for any of the sports I used to do. On top of this the people in my school smoke and go clubbing which I find uninteresting. All of this has caused me to be quiet and quite depressed. I am a lot more insecure now and can hardly speak to people without panicking. \n\nNow on to the actually story. I did actually find one sport in this city and that was rowing. It seemed that I progressed quite well in rowing and my teacher was very ambitious with me.

She telling me this got me to feel that I couldn\u2019t let her down and that I had to do this for her. One day I finally managed to tell the coach that I don\u2019t feel ready but his only response was \u2018No you\u2019re ready\u2019 and I didn\u2019t feel like I could talk back to him so I just replied \u2018Ok\u2019.\n\nThen, the day before the competition I have one training session with the people who I\u2019m supposed to row with in the competition. Keep in my this is my seconded time in a multi crew row boat so my technique was far from perfect. I heard the others in my row boat speak in French which I could speak slightly so I could just make out what they were saying. I heard how they were making fun of how I rowed and how they wanted me off the boat and they made fun of my accent (my accent is slightly Scandinavian) and just in general made fun of me. I also felt that I wasn\u2019t rowing so well and couldn\u2019t keep up with them. This really put me off the competition and I absolutely did not want be in this competition. I came home and began telling my parents how my rowing team doesn\u2019t like me and that I absolutely do not want to do that competition. However they told me that I got myself into this situation and that I had to fix it. I didn\u2019t feel like I could tell my coach \u2018no\u2019 just because he has so much expectations for me and I just didn\u2019t feel secure enough to call him. In the end we gotten in to an argument and to make a long story short, I kind of wanted them to help me send a text or call my coach and tell him I can\u2019t come, they said no, I got mad and locked myself in my room which brings us to now. \n\n\nI really just wanted to let off some steam to know if I\u2019m wrong for getting angry\n\nSorry if my English is wrong\n", "output": "yes", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

POST : This actually happened awhile ago - but I've been feeling kind of guilty about it, so I still think about it. \n\nI have two kids (2 and 4), and sister-in-law(SIL) has 2 kids (5 and 9).  We both live in the same city.  Her parents (my husbands parents) live in a small town about a 5 hour drive away.  I'm very close with their parents. Both families frequently visit the Grandparents, and sometimes we take each others kids with us (but not always).  Although, because my kids are younger - we take their kids more than they take ours (they've never taken our youngest).  Which is fine - he's a toddler, so I get it. \n\nIt was Christmas break, and both families were planning on spending Christmas break at the Grandparents house.  My husband, SIL and her husband all had one week of vacation.  I was lucky and had 2 weeks of vacation.  \n\nMy niece (the 9 year old) was having some problems with her parents (fighting a lot), so my SIL had actually sent her to the Grandparents early.  So she would be there for a total of 3 weeks. \n\nWith my extra week of vacation, I decided that I wanted to head to the Grandparents house a week early as well (my niece was already there at this point).  The primary reason I wanted to go early was because I wanted to put my older son in ski lessons before everybody else got there for Christmas break. My SIL's family does not ski at all. \n\nI contemplated inviting my nephew to go with us, but then I decided not to bring him.  I feel terrible because the other 3 grandchildren all got to be at their grandparents house together, and he was stuck in daycare by himself.   I also felt a bit bad because there was a slight precedent for bringing the other families kids with us (although I actually hate this precedent!).  My SILs family does almost always offer to take my older son with them when they go, and guarantee that they would have offered to take my (older) son if the situation was reversed. \n\nI didn't want to bring him for 3 main reasons.  ONE:  I thought it would be kind of awkward for my son (age 4) to be in ski lessons all week, when his cousin (age 5) wasn't.   TWO:  The drive is was 5 hours of dangerous mountain winter driving.  I am a nervous driver anyway and was already stressed about the drive with just my 2 kids.  I honestly didn't want another kid in the car.   THREE:  Honestly - I didn't want to look after him for a week.  I wanted to have a week of vacation with my kiddos.  Inviting him would mean the adults would be outnumbered 4:3, which is not a huge deal, but also adds up to slightly more work for everyone. \n\n\nAnyway - AITA?

Its the dead of winter here so I took her to a nice coffee and pasty place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn pictures she was physically very my type, however her appearance in person was radically different (she was far shorter and nowhere near the average body type she made herself out to be on pictures). She works with Photoshop for a living so I cant help but suspect there was some kind of shenanigans going on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe is very nice and we get along extremely well, but I cant see myself going for any kind of romantic relationship with her. I am just not physically attracted to her. Whats more is that I recently underwent some semi scary health issues and since then I've been taking care of myself very seriously, sorting out my diet,working out etc. and I really dont want to get involved with someone that might cause me to fall out of these habits. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am gonna try and not ghost this girl, but I really cant see us on another date.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?", "output": "yes", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

I have an Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), which is something like dyslexia for sounds. Everything sounds jumbled unless I\u2019m super focused, and sometimes even then I can\u2019t sort out spoken language from things like road noise. If you\u2019re curious about what it\u2019s like, try downloading one of those free \u201cSpeech Jammer\u201d apps where they play sounds into your ears with one on a slight delay. It makes speaking and understanding quite difficult for me.\n\nThat being said, I was walking in a poorly-lit parking lot toward the Walmart. I normally turn to look at my truck when I press the keyfob to double check that I locked it (the rear lights flash.) But, I had already walked too far away from my vehicle and the fob didn\u2019t make it flash. I knew I would just worry about whether I\u2019d locked it unless I doubled back to check, so I started back to be within range. \n\nThere was an officer in the parking lot. What it probably looked like to him was that I was walking toward the Walmart, saw him, and turned to run to my vehicle. In reality, I didn\u2019t notice him, turned for a totally different reason, and then jogged the ten yards back because I\u2019m a big worrywart. \n\nHe apparently called after me and announced that he was a cop (So his lawyer said), but I had no clue. The parking lot is by a major road, so there is a lot of traffic noise. \n\nHe caught up to me and grabbed me by the arm and pinned me against my truck. It being a parking lot at night, I assumed the worst. I yanked my arm free, and haymakered like my life depended on it, catching him in the temple. I really rung his bell, because he slumped against the tailgate.\n\nI was terrified and in fight mode, because at that point he\u2019d also totally have the grounds to shoot me since I\u2019d punched him. \n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m morally conflicted: I was able to see that he was a cop and that I had already injured him, but I hit him five more times in the head. I\u2019m opposed to violence outside of sport or self defense, but I knew he\u2019d possibly pull his gun. In total, I gave him him a bad concussion, broke his nose, and fractured his eye socket. \n\nI called an ambulance and supported his neck until they got there.\n\nThe whole thing ultimately got settled out of public court. There was footage in the parking lot that very clearly showed him handling me roughly. Plus, I\u2019m disabled, so I\u2019m sure that would have looked really bad for the police department. \n\nHe privately apologized to me a few months after the incident. \n\nI know the whole ordeal probably would have gone down a lot differently if I weren\u2019t a tiny white lady...\n\nI still feel bad about the amount of damage I caused. He now has some memory issues and had to retire early. Like, I generally dislike/distrust/loathe police, but I still hate the idea that I harmed someone more than I probably strictly needed to. \n\nTL;DR \nI don\u2019t hear good, and a cop thought I was running from him.

We dated for a year, broke up, but are still good friends. She has struggled with Borderline Personality Disorder, depression, and anxiety for as long as I've known her. She has been hospitalized previously, and has struggled with self-harm.\n\nSo for as long as I've known her, she's had issues around taking her medication properly. Every few months or so, she'll alter her dosages because she thinks she \"doesn't need it anymore\", or will skip it because she \"forgets\", or was \"being lazy\". Every time she does this, her mental health rapidly declines, she gets back on track, and says she'll be more diligent in taking it. She does not frequently go to her doctor to discuss how the medication is going or alternatives, nor does she go to therapy frequently (both due to cost, and skipping appointments).\n\nThe other day, she was complaining about feeling sick, tired, and just generally being in a poor mood. I inquired if she was still taking her medication, to which she said she had quit cold turkey a few days ago, because she was \"feeling lazy\". I told her to take the medication, and she tried to alter the dose, saying that she didn't feel like taking the proper amount.\n\nAt this point, I told her that I was upset at her and feeling frustrated, because this happens so frequently. I suggested that she get her family to look after her medication for her, or that she come up with some other way to be consistent with taking it. I told her that I was there to support her, and that I was sympathetic to her mental illness, but that I can't hold her hand and check every single day that she's taking her medication properly.\n\nShe responded by saying that I was not being a nice friend, that I was making her feel guilty, and that I was not being supportive and too judgemental.  She said that I was making her feel like she's a burden.\n\nAt this point, I don't know what to do. Over the past few years I've been strict with her, more relaxed, pleaded for her to get help, listened to her vent, offered to take her to counselling, talked to her family, and brainstormed ways for her to keep her mental health up.

We are in town for the holidays visiting her parents who have been very generous to let us stay in their vacation home an hour by car outside of town. There\u2019s a train that goes into town but most days fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents will drive us back and forth into town. Some nights her parents will stay in the vacation home with us, other nights they have their regular home in town so they\u2019ll just drop us off at the vacation home at night, hang out for a bit before heading back into town, then come back out in the morning to drive us into town. \n\nAll has been generally fine, my fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents are the absolute nicest people and we get along well. But being in my 30\u2019s especially, I appreciate having a little independence. So rather than being driven around by my fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents back and forth from the vacation home, I\u2019ve suggested to my fianc\u00e9 that we take the train to and from town which takes an extra hour maybe each way.\n\nThe other day as my fianc\u00e9 and I were on our way back from town on the train, her parents called her and insisted on picking us up from the next train station to drive us back to the vacation home. I told my fianc\u00e9 that I much rather just stay on the train and walk, I didn\u2019t like sitting in the back of a car in general, and to let them know we\u2019re ok staying on the train. But despite my fianc\u00e9\u2019s efforts to tell them that we\u2019re fine and already on a train, her parents persisted (almost getting angry at my fianc\u00e9 at one point) so my fianc\u00e9 gave up and told me we had to get off at the next station where her parents were waiting for us. I was annoyed and unsure how to approach the situation, so just sat silently on the car ride home. My fianc\u00e9 tried explaining to her parents that they were being controlling and her parents cheerfully apologized, but I could see that they found it strange to be apologizing for what they felt was them just being accommodating.\n\nThen the next day, my fianc\u00e9 had plans to hang out with her parents for the day so I went over to a cousin\u2019s place in town to spend time with him and his family. Later that evening, my fianc\u00e9 messaged me to let me know that her and her parents would be coming by at 9 pm to pick me up from my cousin\u2019s to take us back to the vacation home. I asked if they could just drop her off at my cousin\u2019s as we were having a nice time catching up, and her and I could find our own way home later. \n\nThat turned out to not be an option, and again my fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents insisted on taking us back. I was again annoyed but conceded, and again expressed my annoyance by not saying a word on the ride home. Her parents tried to act as though nothing was wrong. When we got back to the vacation home they offered me food they had cooked but my annoyance at being treated like a child got the best of me and I just excused myself and went to bed early.\n\nAm I the asshole for wanting a little flexibility with my time and my fianc\u00e9\u2019s time when we\u2019re on vacation? I understand that some parents will always see their kids as children no matter how old they are, but I felt especially annoyed when I was forced to cut short my time with my cousin who I only see once a year because it was apparently \u201cbedtime.\u201d On the other hand, I am so thankful to have in-laws who accept me as one of their own, as I\u2019ve had ex-girlfriends whose parents didn\u2019t like me for whatever reason and I\u2019m thankful to be not dealing with trying to win approval. \n\nTL;DR: On holiday in my fianc\u00e9\u2019s hometown. Fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents are overly accommodating and can come off as controlling. On the other hand, fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents are genuinely the nicest most generous people you\u2019ll ever meet so I feel bad for coming off as being ungrateful for their hospitality. \n\n", "output": "yes", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

Classmate has a learning disability, which is very common and has a lot of online tools to help. I\u2019m a transfer student, who has a double workload to catch up to my own year. I also have social anxiety, but due to recent improvement, this is something I haven\u2019t shared with my class yet. The only one, who knows is my friend. The subject we are studying is hard and we all have difficulties. Classmate tends to bring us her homework and forcefully try to make us do it for her. I\u2019m terribly behind in this class and have tried explaining this to classmate on multiple occasions without much change.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  Beginning our final project, classmate has a talk to friend and I about being so close and how this makes classmate feel like the third wheel. She reminds us that she needs extra help and time on projects. I suggest we each do homework on the project to speed up the process and ensure I can read the necessary texts. Everyone agrees and I spend the next three days hitting the books. I read about four months\u2019 worth of literature in three days and do the planned homework. As it turns out, I\u2019m the only one that remembered to do the homework and I present it on a projector to kickstart the project. I have explicit reasoning on every single suggestion in an effort to help classmate understand my POV.  Classmate is silent the entire presentation and the following work. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  You need to be blind at this point not to get there is a problem. Classmate again says that we aren't helping and I frustrated with her ask: \"Is it best for you to do the exam with us then?\"  Classmate gets pissed and leave. I feel bad and write her a nice apology, realizing that I did indeed sound like an arsehole. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  We meet again a few days later. Classmate come late and we work peacefully for about an hour. Then classmate explodes. She tells us that we are getting our wish and she won't be joining us for the exam. Then she goes into a long spiel about how I never hold eye-contact with her and just hates her guts, while friend is a saint and helping her so much. Friend ask her what she is planning to do now, and classmate explain our professor has asked her to finish this project with us and then do the exam alone. However, she has by then called me every name in the book and I'm fed up. I leave the table trying to hide how much I'm shaking with anxiety and refused to do the project in same room as her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  I realized afterwards that I've felt anxious with classmate for awhile and I therefore believe I might actually have avoided looking her in the eyes, but I don't want to share this personal piece of info with a stranger to clear this up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  Classmate transferred class to avoid me.", "output": "no", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

POST : For context I've been socially awkward my entire life, but was at my worst in the seventh grade (13-15 years old). I didn't really understand boundaries both physical and verbal, or how to make friends. I had been bullied a lot over the years, to the point where I was suicidal but I somehow thankfully survived and have an incredible life now. My social skills have improved tremendously over the past few years, and while I still don't act properly in every situation I now have made a good group of awesome friends who let me know when I'm being weird, and have helped me learn how to behave properly. But before then when I was being bullied I was constantly told that I was A) retarded and B) that I shouldn't be in a grade school but actually an institution or program for mentally disabled children and that my parents were paying my school lots of money to keep me enrolled in it. This became common knowledge and everyone basically knew me as the \"special kid\" that was there only because of my parents, even other parents believed this and I would catch them saying things like \"it's a disservice to keep him here when he needs to be in an institution.\" I even started believing this due to my poor grades and stopped believing my parents when they told me it was just a rumour spread around by some mean kids. I truly thought I was retarded with anger issues and mental health problems my parents wouldn't tell me about, I was in a really dark place. While playing some magic with my friends this weekend my one friend \"John\" let me know that all those rumours had originated from him. I was shocked, he was a good friend of mine whom I'd become close with in highschool. I asked him why he would spread those vile rumours about me and he just responded with \"I didn't like you in elementary and thought you were actually retarded.\" And then he just kept playing like it was nothing. He wasn't sorry in the slightest, I pressed him for more info and he just told me it was a long time ago and I should just drop it. I don't think he realizes how much those rumours fucked me up, there are still times where I see the parents of old classmates and they talk to me as if I'm slow. I hid a noose in the changeroom of our school gym for over five years, and he brushes this off like it's nothing. So am I the asshole for wanting a little more of an apology from this guy? Sorry for such a long post everyone, this is actually my first post on Reddit and I just needed to rant for a bit so I appreciate all those who read it.\n\nTldr a friend of mine spread rumours that I was retarded back in elementary school and won't apologize for it now since we're adults and it happened a long time ago. Also got annoyed with me  and told me to drop it when I pressed the issue further.", "output": "no", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}]
