How can any sensible person believe that a Trump presidency would do anything other than place enormous power in a cabal of fascists?\n\nI'm from the south, and I know a number of folks who have worked with Hillary, and she's held in the highest regard for her life's work. As another post pointed out, she's been the target of a relentless false narrative. Has she made mistakes? Of course. And some of them were big ones.\n\nBut she's been in the middle of the toughest decisions one can imagine and had to fight election campaigns with brutal adversaries. Sanders has never been tested by fire. And Trump is a maniacal clown, except as president of the most powerful country in the world, not so funny.\n\nLet's hope smart folks who stood with Clinton in the primaries work hard for her election.", "output": "Non-identity-attack", "category": "Toxic Language Detection 953.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms.
