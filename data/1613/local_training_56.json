Pittsburgh Steelers offensive tackle Alejandro Villanueva is a former Army Ranger. While his team remained off the field for the national anthem  he stood by the tunnel with his hand over his heart. As the weekend descended into madness from the liberal media over President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remarks about NFL players who take a knee during the Star-Spangled Banner  Villanueva proved to be Sunday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hero.  Yet  Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin  who defended his team \u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions to remain off the field as avoiding playing politics  was disappointed the former Army Ranger visibly stood for the anthem.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLike I said  I was looking for 100 percent participation  we were gonna be respectful of our football team \u00e2\u0080\u009d said  Tomlin . Guy torched  him :\nLet me see if I've got this straight:  Tomlin  -- a Clinton donor and fundraiser -- is upset that Villanueva was not \"respectful of our football team\" because he decided to honor the country for which he's courageously risked his life by not snubbing the national anthem? This is the display of 'disunity' that bothers Tomlin?\nNow  Fox Sports 1\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe joined  Tomlin   noting that Villanueva should have remained out of sight (via Mediaite) [emphasis mine]:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work for him to step out of the tunnel \u00e2\u0080\u009d Bayless said during Monday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s edition of Undisputed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf  in fact  you had all agreed  you had voted whether a majority or unanimously  to do this as a team to stay up in the tunnel until the Anthem was done. And  Mike Tomlin  was clear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bayless\u00e2\u0080\u0099s colleague  Shannon Sharpe  agreed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTeams  they always take the military mentality  because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all for one  one for all. Whatever we decide to do that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to do.  He  went on  his  own. I get it.  He  was in the military. I commend  him  for  his  service. But in this situation if the team decided that we  all of us  were going to wait in the tunnel while the national anthem is being played  that was the protocol that should have been followed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe thing is no one in that universe gets it. No one. We can talk about free speech all day; the point is that 72 percent of Americans view Colin Kaepernick  who started this whole controversy in San Francisco  and  his  national anthem antics as unpatriotic. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a massive disconnect between the fans and the league. Americans are proud. They respect those who serve and when people take a knee  they see spit flying in the faces of those who have sacrificed to protect our freedoms here at home. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no changing that. If you have to explain  you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re losing. Sometimes it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just wrong. And huddling in the tunnel like the Brits during the Blitz because no one could agree on something as simple as respecting and standing for the national anthem is just absurd. Maybe that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why Villanueva merchandise is going through the roof. For the bubble  this stunt didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work  for everyone else\u00e2\u0080\u0094there was an American hero honoring our country. No one should be fired or suspended for taking a knee of course. They do deserve a kick in the teeth on social media  which was expected  and they shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect the intensity to subside.", "output": "Positive", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

Between March and September  the self-described energy consultant sent at least a half-dozen requests for Trump  as he turned from primary candidate to party nominee  or for members of his team to meet with Russian officials. Among those to express concern about the effort was then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort  who rejected in May 2016 a proposal from  Papadopoulos  for Trump to do so.\nThe exchanges are among more than 20 000 pages of documents the Trump campaign turned over to congressional committees this month after review by White House and defense lawyers. The selection of  Papadopoulos \u00e2\u0080\u0099s emails were read to The Post by a person with access to them. Two other people with access to the emails confirmed the general tone of the exchanges and some specific passages within them.\nA 2016 tweet from Donald Trump shows George Papadopoulos  third from left.

His  entreaties appear to have generated more concern than excitement within the campaign  which at the time was looking to seal the Republican nomination and take on a heavily favored Hillary Clinton in the general election.\nThree months after  Papadopoulos  raised the possibility of a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladi\u00c2\u00admir Putin  the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son Donald Trump Jr. and son-in-law Jared Kushner met with a delegation led by a Russian lawyer offering to provide damaging information on Clinton.\nManafort attended that Trump Tower session in June 2016  a meeting now under scrutiny in the special counsel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s collusion inquiry.

Trump called  Papadopoulos  an \u00e2\u0080\u009cexcellent guy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAlmost immediately   Papadopoulos  came under scrutiny for  his  lack of experience.

The same early juncture in the election cycle is now facing Clinton's primary challenger  Bernie Sanders  a candidate who in 2015 launched his campaign in the span of a couple months and is considered a frontrunner in the next election. The 75-year-old Vermont senator  current and former aides said in recent interviews  has the chance to build a formidable organization with the kind of infrastructure his first campaign lacked.\nEarlier this month  he returned to the key caucus state of Iowa for the first time since the election to speak to a 1 100 progressive activists in Des Moines. At a daylong conference  Revolution Iowa  organizers and volunteers from the 2016 campaign reunited over boxes lunches and at workshops like \u201cThe Fight for Our Lives: Medicare for All!\u201d  Sanders  is scheduled to make a second trip to the state in late August to promote  his  new book.\nAround  Sanders   former aides and advisers point to other signs of activity.\nOn the Democratic National Committee\u2019s Unity Commission  a group created by the  Sanders  and Clinton campaigns to review the fairness of the nominating process  the senator\u2019s allies  led by former campaign manager Jeff Weaver  have eyed changes to superdelegates  open primaries  and the voting calendar that could benefit  Sanders . (Weaver  disputing that idea  said the commission is focused on changes that would help non-leading  lesser-known candidates \u201cget a fair hearing and maybe win.\u201d  Sanders    he  noted  \u201cwould enter as a leading candidate  if not the frontrunner.\u201d)\n\u201cMany of us are out here waiting for a signal from him \u201d said Longabaugh  who  along with Tad Devine  another top adviser  put together the early blueprint for the  Sanders  campaign in spring 2015. \u201cMy sense is that's sort of where Sanders Nation is.\u201d\n Sanders  unquestionably built  his  \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d on the strength of  his  message  not the kind of calculated mechanics that laid the foundation for the Clinton operation in Brooklyn. Still  some backers said  the campaign also suffered from basic structural and tactical work that  the senator  not only came late to  but at points actively resisted.\nThe nuts-and-bolts planning for a  Sanders  campaign began in March 2015  shortly before  his  April 30 announcement. In 2014  the liberal radio host Bill Press had hosted  Sanders  at  his  Washington home to talk over the decision to run with Senate staffers  senior Democrats  and strategists  along with \u201cwise guys and gals who pontificated a lot \u201d recalled Longabaugh. \u201cHelpful for  Bernie  and [ his  wife] Jane to hear \u2014 but it was not planning.\u201d\nLess than four months into the race  in August 2015  senior advisers sat down with  Sanders  and  his  wife in Burlington to address the issue in blunt terms: If they wanted to compete  they needed a more serious operation \u2014 a campaign with proper infrastructure and a more robust travel schedule  even if it meant missing votes in the Senate  they told  him   according to a person briefed on the conversation at the time. In short  there were basic realities about running for president that would have to be accepted.\nEven after the meeting  billed publicly by advisers as \u201cphase two\u201d of the campaign   Sanders  struggled with that adjustment.  He  had to be convinced that TV ads were not just effective but necessary  and that using a pollster did not mean putting a finger to the wind.  He  never hired a political director.

Georgian President Doing Camping Outside Ukraine ' s Parliament ? Enlarge this image toggle caption Sergei Chuzavkov / AFP / Getty Images Sergei Chuzavkov / AFP / Getty Images Just what is  Mikhail Saakashvili  doing ? Georgian president   Ukrainian governor   stateless fugitive \u2014 in the past decade    he  ' s played all these roles   among others . But now that  he  ' s perched in a tent community near the parliament building in Kiev   an opposition leader surrounded by a huge group of restive followers   the question of who this bombastic politician is and what his aims are has become more pressing than ever . Trouble is   the answer to the question will vary wildly depending on whom you ask . Pose it to Ukrainian authorities and they ' ll tell you he ' s a rabble - rousing criminal . The Security Service of Ukraine has tried twice this week to arrest him on the suspicion he ' s conspiring with pro - Russian figures to undermine President Petro Poroshenko ' s government . The first time   on Tuesday   they had to haul him down from his apartment building ' s roof \u2014 only to see him pulled from their police van by his angry supporters . On Wednesday they tried again   and again they failed to bring him in   this time because they were repulsed by tire - tossing members of the protest encampment set up in Mariyinsky Park .  Saakashvili  ' s supporters   for their part   dismiss the authorities ' allegations as trumped - up charges designed to eliminate a significant rival to Poroshenko .  Saakashvili  has cast  himself  as a crusader against government graft   and  he  has accrued a significant following in the process . Neither version of  Saakashvili  \u2014 the opportunistic demagogue and the steely political activist \u2014 tells the whole story . But dig a little deeper into  his  long   labyrinthine past   and one might find a fair amount of fodder to support both conclusions . A rise and fall in Georgia Swept into power at the head of a peaceful uprising known as the Rose Revolution   the brash young Saakashvili represented an optimistic vision of democratic reform and independence from neighboring Russia ' s influence . A former justice minister   he won the presidency in 2004 \u2014 and won plaudits from the West while he was at it . \" Your courage is inspiring democratic reformers and sending a message that echoes across the world  \" President George W . Bush told him on a state visit there in 2005 . \" Freedom will be the future of every nation and every people on Earth .\" Enlarge this image toggle caption Tim Sloan / AFP / Getty Images Tim Sloan / AFP / Getty Images During his time in power   Saakashvili sought to refashion Georgia in the Western capitalist image   opening markets and striving to wean the country off its economic dependence on Russia . \" We ' ve been thrown into the open sea  \" he told Newsweek in 2006 . \" The time has come for us to learn to swim .\" Yet his grand Western dream eroded as his tenure stretched on . A dayslong war with Russia ended disastrously for Georgia in 2008   and by Election Day in 2012 his reputation as a reformer had withered under criticism that he ' d become increasingly authoritarian . He ended up soundly losing that election . Within two years of his electoral loss   the prosecutor ' s office in Georgia had filed charges on Saakashvili and dozens of other former officials   saying he had exceeded his authority as president and engaged in corruption . He called the charges a \" farce  \" according to Reuters   adding that the allegations lodged against him by the new government were simply aimed at \" pleasing Russia .\" He was out of country at the time the charges were filed . He has not been back since to Georgia   which continues to angle for his extradition . About - faces in Ukraine When  Saakashvili  came to Ukraine in 2014   Kiev welcomed  him  warmly as an ally . Massive demonstrations had only recently forced out the country ' s pro - Russian president   Viktor Yanukovych . Newly installed in office   Poroshenko saw in  Saakashvili  a fellow antagonist of the Kremlin   and  he  wasted little time in finding an official function for the Georgian . The president summarily granted  Saakashvili  Ukrainian citizenship in 2015 \u2014 a move that meant  he  would have to give up  his  Georgian citizenship   which   given  his  legal woes there   couldn ' t have been a difficult choice . Poroshenko also went one step further   appointing the new citizen to the governorship of the Odessa region . But as Radio Free Europe notes   the job didn ' t exactly go smoothly . Or last long : \" After a stint that included occasionally dramatic acts of political theater   the Ukrainian plan went awry and  Saakashvili  quit in November 2016   publicly accusing Poroshenko of blocking  his  reform efforts .  He  announced the launch of  his  own opposition party   called Movement of New Forces   and began campaigning against  his  former ally .\" Indeed   the disputes grew so acrimonious   a notorious fight even broke out between  Saakashvili  and the country ' s interior minister at a council meeting . Arsen Avakov said that   faced with  Saakashvili  ' s \" hysterical \" behavior   \" I refrained from hitting him   and just threw water in his face .\" It ' s a long time since I ' ve seen such a bonkers populist . \" It ' s a long time since I ' ve seen such a bonkers populist  \" he wrote after the meeting in late 2015   according to The Guardian . \" Nobody could get a word in edgeways   he was interrupting everyone including the president .\" Earlier this year   roughly nine months after his resignation   Poroshenko stripped  Saakashvili  of his citizenship while the latter was on a visit to the U . S .  Saakashvili  had been a Ukrainian for a mere two years . Now   unwelcome by authorities in both the countries  he  has called home   the promising politician who was once the great Western hope for the former Soviet territories is a man without a state . That didn ' t stop  him  from returning to Ukraine   however . In a move reminiscent of the mob action that freed  him  Tuesday   Saakashvili pushed  his  way into Ukraine in September in dramatic fashion . The German newspaper Deutsche Welle described the scene : \" The circumstances were astonishing   even for a country like Ukraine   whose recent history is rich in scurrilous political incidents . Initially   the 49 - year - old former governor of Odessa oblast attempted to enter the country by train   accompanied by a crowd of journalists . The Ukrainian train was stopped in Poland and the politician was requested to disembark .  Saakashvili  then traveled by bus to another border crossing   where  his  well - muscled supporters literally carried  him  over the border . The Ukrainian border guards appeared to be helpless .\" Since then    Saakashvili  has railed tirelessly against  his  old friend in Kiev . Enlarge this image toggle caption Evgeniy Maloletka / AP Evgeniy Maloletka / AP Populist or provocateur ? It ' s unclear where this skein unspools from here . Saakashvili ' s status remains entirely up in the air . Though stateless   he can ' t claim the status of a refugee since Ukraine rejected his petition for political asylum last month \u2014 and though he ' s free for now   he ' s a wanted man in both countries where he once held leadership positions . Long known for his opposition to Russia    Saakashvili  nevertheless now stands accused of what Ukraine ' s top prosecutor calls \" the revenge plan of the pro - Kremlin forces in Ukraine .\" \" This part of the ' Russian Spring ' operation in Kiev is related to the cooperation of a series of politicians \u2014 first of all    Mikhail Saakashvili  with the members of Yanukovych ' s organized criminal group  \" Yuriy Lutsenko told reporters on Tuesday   playing audio and video footage purporting to show  Saakashvili  arranging payments from a wealthy pro - Russian businessman . These payments   according to Lutsenko   funded \" protest rallies aimed at seizing power in Ukraine and facilitating the members of the organized criminal group .\" But in a Ukraine just years removed from political revolution   law enforcement officers appear reluctant to press the matter   painfully aware of the dangers of making martyrs out of him and his supporters . So   even after multiple attempts at arrests    Saakashvili  remains at large \u2014 and remains vocal in denying the charges . \" I appeal to Poroshenko : Why do you need these provocations ?\" he wrote of his erstwhile ally on Facebook   according to a translation by the Ukrainian news service UNIAN . \" Do not attack or force people into fighting back !

The media-savvy special prosecutors have colluded with the Fourth Estate to try \u2014 and convict \u2014 Paxton in the court of public opinion long before the case even comes to trial.  Wice  in particular is an aspiring media celebrity  serving as a TV \u201clegal analyst\u201d on Houston\u2019s Channel 2 (KPRC) since 2003. Think of a male version of Nancy Grace or Greta Van Susteren \u2014 a Dan Abrams wannabe. One profile described the bombastic  Wice  as a \u201cmedia magnet\u201d who \u201cnever shies away from the spotlight.\u201d The KPRC website brags that\nBeginning the very day  Schaffer  and Wice were appointed by Becker  the prosecutors were in contact with the media  shamelessly promoting themselves by mass distributing press statements and publicity photos.  Schaffer  and  Wice  obviously intended to milk the case for all the news coverage they could get  for two self-serving reasons: to poison the well of public opinion against Paxton  and to generate free advertising to attract future clients. Neither motive is ethical for a special prosecutor. Yet   Wice  has conceded that pretrial media coverage \u201cimpacts the way potential jurors view our client\u2019s case long before they are ushered into the courtroom for voir dire. Being able to effectively represent your client on the courthouse steps can be every bit as important as representing them inside the courtroom.\u201d\nMoreover   Wice  once cynically acknowledged the economic benefits of making media appearances  informing fellow lawyers that \u201cappearing on TV is client development \u2014 free advertising \u2014 that might well yield future business. And you never can tell what that one local  or  with a bit of good fortune  national TV appearance  can do for you or your practice.\u201d Exploiting the media  in other words  is the latest form of ambulance chasing. \u201cCelebrity\u201d attorneys  like the Kardashians  are famous for being famous.\nIn that vein  Schaffer and Wice continued a steady stream of self-aggrandizing communications with the press corps during the \u201cinvestigation\u201d and grand jury phases  despite the strict secrecy associated with the grand jury process. The special prosecutors had numerous communications (by email and telephone) with the New York Times\u2019 reporter early in the case  following which the NYT reported Paxton\u2019s indictment on August 1  2015  before the indictment was even unsealed. Was this national media scoop a coincidence? The special prosecutors were the obvious source of the highly-unprofessional leak  but the press corps gratefully reciprocated by uncritically reporting  Wice \u2019s spin as \u201cnews.\u201d\nIn addition to regularly sending eager reporters status updates and copies of pleadings and orders  on at least two occasions  Wice  circulated to the media Paxton\u2019s annual Personal Financial Statement  presumably to encourage reporters to scrutinize the donors to Paxton\u2019s legal defense fund \u2014 a wholly improper purpose. In an even more egregious breach of propriety   Wice  emailed a copy of Paxton\u2019s booking \u201cmugshot\u201d to his KPRC colleague  reporter Phil Archer  shortly after Paxton was released on bail. The only word to describe this type of conduct is \u201csleazy.\u201d\nIntemperately denouncing Paxton\u2019s legal arguments as \u201cfrivolous\u201d and \u201cclearly baseless \u201d the special prosecutors\u2019 tone toward Paxton dripped with contempt as they delivered sound bites to groveling reporters on deadline. When asked by a reporter about a new attorney joining the Paxton defense team to deal with the federal civil case (which was ultimately dismissed with prejudice)   Schaffer  sarcastically responded \u201cNever heard of him. Looks like we set off the Lawyer Relief Act\u2026\u201d When a prominent Paxton supporter wrote an op-ed in the Midland Reporter-Telegram  criticizing the indictment  the thin-skinned prosecutors immediately issued a florid press statement \u2014 presumably on the taxpayers\u2019 nickel \u2014 condemning the piece as a \u201crant\u201d containing \u201clies bathed in the cologne of half-truths  fabrications and disinformation.\u201d\nMimicking the prosecutors\u2019 flippant and unprofessional tone  some reporters began running stories with shockingly-unbalanced headlines  such as \u201cAnother Day  Another Idiotic Ken Paxton Motion \u201d which  Schaffer  and Wice gleefully circulated to their media contacts  with the message \u201cI love it.\u201d If media outlets did not parrot the prosecutors\u2019 swaggering narrative  they were cut off from \u201cinsider access.\u201d\nThis incestuous arrangement likely explains why the Dallas Morning News  which was closely following the Paxton case  never reported the bombshell mentioned in Part 2 \u2014 that  Schaffer  was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in a federal RICO case against the leader of the Bandidos motorcycle gang \u2014 a revelation that would have greatly tarnished the special prosecutors\u2019 undeserved Boy Scout image \u2014 which McGaughy had gone to extraordinary lengths to burnish.\nThis apparently referred to Paxton\u2019s retention of a defense team that included Dan Cogdell and Philip Hilder  with respect to whom  Schaffer  and Wice issued polite public statements.\nThe hundreds of email exchanges between the prosecutors and reporters (McGaughy in particular) are clearly collusive. With the avid cooperation of the press corps  for two and a half years  Schaffer  and Wice have been busy smearing Paxton through leaks and planted stories  all while risibly claiming to be \u201cseeking justice on behalf of the people of Texas.\u201d\nTo re-cap this series: The baseless  politicized prosecution of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has been a travesty on many levels. Following the recusal of Collin County District Attorney Greg Willis  the matter should not have been referred to mercenary \u201cspecial prosecutors\u201d for investigation;  Schaffer  (the unindicted co-conspirator in a RICO case) and Wice (an incorrigible diva) were not suitable for the assignment in any event; the open-ended compensation arrangement agreed to by Judge Scott Becker was both unlawful and foolhardy; the grand jury indictment improperly obtained by the unscrupulous prosecutors amounts to fabricated felonies \u2014 made-up crimes never previously prosecuted in a Texas court; the overtly-biased George Gallagher presided over the case as a farcical kangaroo court; changing the venue of the case to Harris County was an absurd and outrageous denial of due process to Paxton; et cetera  ad infinitum.", "output": "Positive", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

On Twitter   she  wrote: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI congratulate President @ HassanRouhani for strong mandate received.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe move was not well-received in Iran where many took to social media  likely through virtual private networks (VPNs) as many services are banned in Iran  to condemn the lawmakers taking selfies with  Ms. Mogherini .\nNot only a supporter of the Iranian regime   Mogherini  has even come out in favour of the idea of political Islam in Europe. At a speech in Brussels in 2015  she remarked: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIslam belongs in Europe. It holds a place in Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history  in our culture  in our food and \u00e2\u0080\u0093 what matters most \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s present and future.\u00e2\u0080\u009d", "output": "Positive", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

The Philadelphia 76ers have agreed to a five-year  $148 million max rookie contract extension for  fourth-year center Joel Embiid   according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.\nAccording to Wojnarowski  if  Embiid  hits the max criteria over the course of the deal  it could be worth as much as $178 million.\nAs such  the 76ers are taking a massive gamble on  Embiid  after just 31 career games. Embiid  the No. 3 pick in the 2014 draft  missed the first two seasons of his career with foot injuries before playing 31 games last year \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and then missing the rest of the season with a torn meniscus.\nBut those 31 games were a revelation.  Embiid  averaged 20 points on 46% shooting  36% from downtown  with nearly eight rebounds and 2.5 blocks per game. With Embiid on the floor  the lowly 76ers actually outscored teams  competing with opponents for the first time in years after undergoing a dramatic rebuild.\nThe Sixers know what they have in  Embiid  on the floor \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an athletic  inside-out  physical specimen capable of defending the rim and taking over the game on offense. The question is how often they'll get to have  Embiid  on the floor.\nSixers coach Brett Brown has already said the team is being extremely cautious with  Embiid 's health. He has sat out parts of training camp this season  taking part in 5-on-5 drills only occasionally. Few believe he'll play a full  82-game season soon. ESPN's Zach Lowe estimated that in order for the 76ers to be a playoff team  they'll need at least 50 games out of  Embiid   a modest projection that is still nearly double what he played last year.\nIf  Embiid  can't get over his injury woes  the 76ers will be saddled with a long  expensive contract for a player who can't get on the floor. According to Wojnarowski  the deal contains some \"salary cap protection\" for the 76ers if  Embiid  suffers a long-term injury  though it's unclear what the guarantees and non-guarantees are at this point.\nBut when  Embiid  is healthy   he  can do things like this:\nThe 76ers have decided that however much of this they can get from  Embiid  per season is worth it.\nIf  Embiid  recovers from  his  physical ailments and can play at least over 50% of the season annually  then the deal will be worthwhile. Stocked with back-to-back No. 1 picks in Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz  the Sixers have a core that may be the most promising in the league.\nBut until  Embiid  is healthy and stays healthy  the team will always have a big question hanging over it.", "output": "Neutral", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

This is surprising. After all  the Essential Phone was the perfect opportunity to see what  Andy Rubin   the \"Father of Android\" and leader of Essential  had to say about the Android OS' direction since  he  left Google in 2014. Would  he  put  his  personal touch on the software  showing us what the OS might have looked like had  he  stayed at Google? As it turns out  it appears instead that  Rubin  had more to say about a smartphone's design than  he  did about the Android OS.\nI suppose I was expecting something different from  Rubin .  He  did mention in May that the Essential Phone would run stock Android  but I wasn't expecting  him  to have such an extremely light touch and to barely alter anything about the OS.\n Rubin  created Android  so  he 's no stranger to developing mobile phone software. And given how much attention Essential paid to every little detail of the phone's hardware  it's a good bet that  Rubin  didn't just go with the plain version of Android out of sheer laziness.\nThe move suggests that  Rubin  believes stock Android is still the best Android compared to what you see on phones from Samsung  LG  and the numerous Chinese companies like Huawei. Stock Android means none of the duplicate apps from the smartphone maker and carrier cluttering things up. Android looks and works exactly the way Google intended it to.\nTo be clear  those companies make great phones  as their popularity shows. Yet  I've always believed that nothing beats stock Android.

There is nothing the US can do to North Korea that will lead to its renunciation of its nuclear weapons program. That is because North Korea already holds US allies hostage to violence we cannot control\u00e2\u0080\u0094and may already or will soon pose a similar threat to the US homeland\u00e2\u0080\u0094and thus presents an unacceptable risk of retaliation for any American offensive military action. There is nothing the US can do for North Korea that might induce it to denuclearize  because keeping North Korea on a war footing vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis the US keeps  the regime of Kim Jong Un  in power. There is nothing the international community  including China  can do to North Korea by enforcing sanctions  or for North Korea by relieving it of sanctions  that would convince North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons because  the regime  is convinced  with some reason  that it is only the threats it poses to others that keep it from suffering regime change. Nevertheless  the US cannot tolerate or co-exist with a North Korean nuclear capability; that is because such a capability would deter the US from protecting its allies were they threatened  extorted or attacked by North Korea. This result would risk dissolution of the American-Pacific alliance and the rapid proliferation of nuclear weapons to former allies that had become intensely nationalistic and anti-American. There is however one option that has yet to be considered and that has some promise.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true that North Korea used to seek financial assistance in exchange for promises to restrain its weapons programs.  Kim  has changed all that. This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t because of  his  ferocious and aggressive personality so much as it arises from the evolution of the North Korean regime and its political role in the world.\nThat role has developed in an ominous new direction since 1989. When Russian subsidies to North Korea disappeared in 1990  the resulting famine killed up to 10% of the North Korean population  but North Korea neither collapsed nor moderated its policies. In fact  we can now see that the development of a nuclear weapons program was a crucial part of  the regime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  domestic survival strategy after 1989 precisely because this program provokes US hostility and concern.\nDuring the Cold War  North Korea and South Korea had comparable economic development  and South Korea had a series of highly authoritarian if not totalitarian governments. With the end of the Cold War  South Korea enjoyed a booming economy and a very promising democracy. Internationally  communist governments were collapsing everywhere. But the response of Kim Jung Il was to increase its reliance on military force and put the nation on a war footing for an imminent US invasion. Consumer shortages  famine  rationing were all justified in order to maintain an immense military\u00e2\u0080\u0094its active duty army is the fourth largest in the world. The external threat also justified political oppression to identify and destroy traitors. B. R. Myers  a North Korea scholar at Dongseo University in South Korea  has suggested that the famine \u00e2\u0080\u009cmay have strengthened support for  the regime  by [animating a] sense of ethnic victimhood.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Myers concluded in a 2010 book  \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is  the regime \u00e2\u0080\u0099s awareness of a pending legitimacy crisis  not a fear of attack from without  which makes it behave evermore provocatively on the world stage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Thus US reactions tend to consolidate power in North Korea; and there is nothing we can do to ease the threat to North Korean legitimacy in the long run because the threat to  the regime  derives from global trends that are weakening the domestic hold on power of all industrial nation-state regimes (though  as we shall see  there are steps that can ease  Kim \u00e2\u0080\u0099s domestic anxieties in the near term.)\nMoreover  North Korean weakness\u00e2\u0080\u0094as to which their aggressive foreign policy is a compensation\u00e2\u0080\u0094also tends to limit US options. I suppose it might be said  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t got nothing  you got nothing to lose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But it is true with respect to all states that while sanctions can force small foreign policy changes  they cannot effectuate changes that fundamentally threaten the stability and continuity of the government. North Korea sees its weapons as essential to its survival\u00e2\u0080\u0094not only by keeping its enemies at bay (this is the lesson of Saddam Hussein  Mouammar Khadafy and the Ukraine)\u00e2\u0080\u0094but nuclear weapons are also essential to the internal stature of  the regime . It is a feature that is not often appreciated of sanctions that they work  or can work  quite successfully  only within a rather narrow sphere because that is their utility. People who say  \u00e2\u0080\u009cSanctions don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work \u00e2\u0080\u009d don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t appreciate that if sanctions could result in the kind of policy changes that are wrought from military action  a military response would ensue. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s their very limitation that makes sanctions useful.\nThis suggests that the Chinese  who cannot be indifferent to the proliferation of nuclear weapons to South Korea and Japan  ought to be willing to pressure North Korea into denuclearization. And indeed  pressuring the Chinese to pressure the North Koreans is the substance of current US policy. There are risks in pursuing this policy; China would probably insist on the withdrawal of the THAAD systems from South Korea because they not only protect South Korea from North Korea but also degrade the effectiveness of the Chinese deterrent (even if only marginally). But more important than this is the fact that China really has very little leverage over North Korea. Indeed it should be noted that  Kim  has steadily weakened Chinese influence by purging pro-Chinese North Korean officials. Moreover  there is no negative pressure\u00e2\u0080\u0094cutting off fuel supplies or reducing an already modest trading relationship\u00e2\u0080\u0094that could force  the North Korean regime  to change course because  as has been remarked  one does not commit suicide for fear of death. Thus I have concluded that there is nothing the US or China can do to North Korea\u00e2\u0080\u0094no coercive acts at an acceptable cost to the US\u00e2\u0080\u0093that will yield the denuclearization of the North Korean arsenal.\nBut that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that there is no conceivable way out of this crisis. On the contrary  one can already see the outlines of a possible negotiation. What follows is a rather radical proposal that has many counterintuitive aspects but which  I have come to believe  represents the best way out of a rapidly deteriorating position. This option would be to induce a nuclear guarantee for  the North Korean regime from China \u00e2\u0080\u0094an instance of Chinese extended deterrence.\nJang Song Thaek  Kim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s uncle  was North Korea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s principal interlocutor with China. His arrest and execution\u00e2\u0080\u0094as well as the removal of dozens of other officials associated with closer ties to China\u00e2\u0080\u0094marked a turning point in Kim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rejection of a foreign policy that attempted to promote economic growth in favor of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cmilitary first\u00e2\u0080\u009d policy. His truculent indifference to Chinese sensibilities was confirmed when he ordered the assassination in February of his brother  Kim Jong Nam  who had been living in Macao under Chinese protection. Then earlier this month  Kim Jong Un pointedly chose the week of Xi Jinping\u00e2\u0080\u0099s BRICS summit in Beijing to detonate a nuclear test. So one mustn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t oversell the chance of success for this proposal.\nBut if the policy I propose is the least bad for the US to pursue\u00e2\u0080\u0094if it is imperative that we at least try this new option before resorting to war or accepting defeat\u00e2\u0080\u0094is it not also the least bad option for North Korea in light of the certain decline of its long-term security in the face of advancing US first-strike technology? Remember that it was  Kim \u00e2\u0080\u0099s awareness of a crisis in legitimacy that drove  him  to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cmilitary-first\u00e2\u0080\u009d policy. The integration of China into the international system  rather than the collapse of the Soviet satellite regimes  could show a new path toward the domestic legitimation of  Kim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s regime . Our aim must be to re-orient  Kim \u00e2\u0080\u0099s paranoia  making  him  more afraid of losing an attractive opportunity for security in the eyes of  his  own people than  he  is afraid of dependence on China.\nNo one will take this radical proposal seriously unless we stop deluding ourselves about the incentives we can realistically employ to compel  the North Korean regime . There is no chance that anything short of an ironclad guarantee of their preservation as a dynastic regime free from outside intervention will modify their behavior. They will starve their people and run almost incalculable risks because they have no other credible choice. And no guarantee that the US gives is credible to the North Korean leadership.\nThis observation leads one to draw a couple of further conclusions that are sometimes absent in the public debate. The first is that as our alliances are what are actually threatened  we should move swiftly to shore these up. Consultations with our allies in Tokyo  Canberra and Seoul are paramount. What do they want to see from us? How can we avoid embarrassing them in front of their own publics without hamstringing the protection of our legitimate security interests? Second  we should not make threats that validate Kim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rhetoric by making it appear that we are planning to punish him for his rhetoric. That there is a plot by the Americans to destroy  his regime  is the fundamental premise of his domestic propaganda as well as his thinking.\nIn summary  economic sanctions  and/or threats of our military action can push  Kim  towards negotiations but in the end those negotiations will be highly likely to founder on  his  need for nuclear guarantees. We need to prepare for the fact that a resolution of the current crisis will likely require a PRC guarantee. Are we prepared to support that? I think we should be. The course I propose is not without costs: it might increase the risk of a Chinese-US confrontation  and it would link Chinese nuclear strategy to a surrogate state that is inclined to get into conflicts. It is  however  a more promising option than any being canvassed at the present. And time  at this juncture  is not on our side.", "output": "Neutral", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

A city crime scene inspector told the jury that the defendant aimed the gun in Steinle's direction seeking to strike her.\nThe gun had been stolen four days earlier from the parked car of a visiting off-duty Bureau of Land Management ranger. The prosecution and defense agree that there is no evidence linking  Garcia Zarate  to that robbery.\nAs KQED's Alex Emslie told All Things Considered  the case hangs on whether the jury concludes that  Garcia Zarate  intentionally shot Steinle as the prosecution argued  or that it was a tragic accident  as the defense contends.\nGarcia Zarate  who is reported to have no more than a second grade education  had been deported five times and was scheduled for a sixth deportation after serving a 46-month federal prison term for felony re-entry to the United States. But instead of deporting him  federal authorities transferred him to San Francisco on a warrant for a 20-year old marijuana charge. San Francisco prosecutors eventually dropped the charge because evidence in the case had been destroyed.

An alien star in distant space seems to be acting very strangely . NASA ' s Kepler Space Telescope caught sight of the star as part of the spacecraft ' s hunt for planets outside the solar system   which are also known as exoplanets . Kepler looks for exoplanets by seeing a dip in the light of a star   presumably when a planet passes between its host star and the spacecraft . This eclipse produces a regular   periodic dip in the starlight that can help scientists characterize the planet . But when Kepler caught sight of this star \u2014 called KIC 8462852 \u2014 it didn ' t see anything resembling a regular   periodic dip in starlight . Instead   the probe saw a more erratic dimming and brightening of the star   nothing like what you ' d expect to see when a planet eclipses . \u201c We \u2019 d never seen anything like this star  \u201d Tabetha Boyajian   a postdoc researcher at Yale told the Atlantic   one of the first publications to report on the finding . \u201c It was really weird . We thought it might be bad data or movement on the spacecraft   but everything checked out .\u201d So   what could this weird star be ? Numerous media outlets   including   to some extent   The Atlantic   have latched onto the idea that it could be an \u201c alien megastructure \u201d constructed by an extraterrestrial civilization orbiting that star . Such a structure would be large enough to periodically block light from the star . But the truth is that scientists aren ' t yet sure what could be causing the star to flicker from our perspective   and an \u201c alien megastructure \u201d is pretty far down on their list of possible explanations for the light curve . \u201c It \u2019 s kind of funny   I don \u2019 t really know how this ended up going from weird dips in a light curve to alien structures  \u201d Kepler scientist Steve Howell told Mashable in an interview . \u201c The alien hypothesis should be a last resort . Something we consider for fun rather than out of seriousness  \u201d MIT exoplanet scientist Sara Seager told Mashable in an email . In reality   there could be other   very cool explanations for why the star seems so odd . Some people have suggested that there could be a huge swarm of comets surrounding the star   causing its light to dip in and out from Kepler \u2019 s perspective . A planet that has broken up in orbit around the star    Howell  added   could even cause the odd light dips .  Howell  was also reminded of another star system  he  and  his  colleagues working with Kepler have been studying recently . The strange solar system \u2014 named KIC 4150611 \u2014 appears to be made up of five stars orbiting one another   a kind of star system never before observed . \u201c While that \u2019 s an unusual system   it \u2019 s certainly not aliens . It \u2019 s just stars  \u201d  Howell  said . The KIC 4150611 light curve looks kind of similar to the ones produced by Kepler for KIC 8462852    Howell  said .  Howell  and  his  colleagues haven \u2019 t yet published their findings   but they hope to in the near future . The KIC 8462852 findings   which have set off the media speculation   were first detailed in a study that has been submitted for publication to the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society   though it has not yet gone all the way through the peer review process . The discoveries were made   in part   thanks to a group of citizen scientists working with Planet Hunters to comb through Kepler data . The initial study didn \u2019 t mention any kind of \u201c alien megastructure  \u201d Howell said . The authors instead opted to discuss some more mundane \u2014 and more likely \u2014 possibilities for what they were seeing in their data . The first study led to another not - yet - peer - reviewed paper posted to arxiv . org . That website is a repository of electronic preprints   known as e - prints   of scientific papers in fields from mathematics to biology   all of which can be accessed for free . These papers have not yet been fully peer previewed   however   which means their findings should be treated as preliminary . The second paper that appeared on arxiv mentioned what a structure built by aliens might look like and how it might relate to KIC 8462852   but \u2014 and this is a crucial detail \u2014 that study also made it clear that \" it ' s aliens \" was not necessarily a good explanation for the light curve .  Howell  has offered to take some photos of KIC 8462852 when  his  team uses a ground - based observatory for other observations next week . This could help clear up the mystery of exactly what \u2019 s going on with that star system . \u201c In science   I think that we believe Arxiv papers are nice   but if they \u2019 re not refereed and accepted   then you always have a little skepticism about them or a little concern  \u201d  Howell  said . \u201c I don \u2019 t think [ this ] paper falls into the \u2018 crap \u2019 category   but it \u2019 s not yet accepted   so we have to take the results that are in it with a little bit of a grain of salt .\u201d For  Howell    all the talk of possible alien structures seen by Kepler hits oddly close to home .  Howell  recently edited a book of short stories called \" A Kepler \u2019 s Dozen : Thirteen Stories About Distant Worlds That Really Exist  \" which includes a story eerily like this one . The short tale involves a group of aliens that uses giant   opaque sails to block out the light from their sun in order to send messages to other civilizations . This alien race generates a kind of \u201c Morse Code \u201d that other civilizations can interpret by reading the light curve produced by the dips . \u201c It \u2019 s really fun because now it \u2019 s like the science fiction story has come true in a sense  \" Howell said .", "output": "Positive", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

As a result   he  and animators were speaking two different languages.\nA roving  Mr. Kasanoff   animators said  would request that things be \u00e2\u0080\u009cmore awesome\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009c30 percent better\u00e2\u0080\u009d and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand why someone trained in texture couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do modeling work.

The famed New York gossip columnist  Liz Smith  has died at 94.  Her  decades long column in the New York Daily News gave people a look into the lives of the rich and famous and powerful.\nFor decades  if you wanted to know where a famous person was last night and with whom  you'd see what  Liz Smith  was writing.  Smith  was a famed gossip columnist who chronicled the lives of the rich and powerful in New York's tabloids.  She  died Sunday at the age of 94. NPR's Andrew Limbong has this appreciation.\nANDREW LIMBONG  BYLINE:  Liz Smith  liked to compare gossip to Greek tragedy.  She  was especially fond of this quote from an academic calling gossip an emotional release valve that allows us to express a whole range of human findings - envy  anger  compassion - and to find solace in other people's woes. But  she  herself wasn't that high-minded about it.\n LIZ SMITH : It wasn't just about people doing terrible things all the time. A lot of it was just wannabe news.\nLIMBONG: This is  Smith  on NPR in 2009.  She  talked about bringing readers to places where all the rich and famous people hung out.\n SMITH : You wanted to go. You wanted to know how - what would it be? How much did you tip the hat check girl in a place like that? You know  looking through the keyhole at how your betters lived  I guess.\nLIMBONG:  Liz Smith  was born in Fort Worth  Texas  in 1923.  Her  babysitter used to take  her  to movies where  she 'd be captivated by movie stars.  She  moved to New York and began ghost writing gossip. In the '70s   she  eventually got  her  own column in the New York Daily News simply titled  Liz Smith .  She  never wanted  her  columns to be mean  and they were far removed from the sort of bloggy online snark of the gossip that came after  her . But  she  had insider information on the likes of Rock Hudson  Elizabeth Taylor  Elaine Stritch.\nDOREE SHAFRIR: And you could tell that  she  was writing them sort of from a place of almost  like  love of the people  she  was writing about. Like   she  really enjoyed the world that  she  was writing about and the characters in it.\nLIMBONG: That's Doree Shafrir.  She  covers tech for BuzzFeed now  but  she  used to work at Gawker and profiled  Smith  for the New York Observer in 2008.\nSHAFRIR: Like a lot of people in media  but probably especially for gossip columnists of  her  era  the line between friends and sources and subjects necessarily got very blurred.\nLIMBONG:  Smith  was criticized for not being objective  but  she  didn't pretend to be.  She  told NPR in 2009 about  her  biggest scoop.  She  got it from  her  friend Ivana Trump.\n SMITH : One day Ivana called me and asked me to come to the Plaza Hotel. And when I got there   she  threw  herself  in my arms and told me that Donald didn't want  her  anymore  and that  she  had just gone through all of this plastic surgery to enhance  her  looks. And I tried to give  her  some motherly advice.\nLIMBONG: The Trumps' divorce was a big deal  and  Smith  knew what the fallout would look like.\n SMITH : I said  get yourself a PR person who's respectable and defend yourself against him.\nLIMBONG: Donald Trump  who was a celebrity real estate developer at the time  wasn't  thrilled Smith  was writing about  his  divorce.\n SMITH :  He  said  he  was going to buy the New York Daily News in order to fire me.", "output": "Neutral", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

But Madrid had little interest in any exercise of Catalan self-determination. In a speech Sunday evening   Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy  pinned the blame for what happened on Catalan secessionists  who engineered the confrontation by staging what Madrid deems an illegal vote. \u201cToday there has not been a self-determination referendum in Catalonia \u201d  Rajoy  declared. \u201cThe rule of law remains in force with all its strength.\u201d\nBut although  Rajoy  thwarted the immediate prospect of independence   he  \u2014 not  his  Catalan opponents \u2014 looks like the day's big loser.  His  government took a heavy-handed line with Catalonia's secessionists in the buildup to the vote  and  Rajoy  is being slammed by opponents both inside Catalonia and elsewhere for making a mess of the proceedings.\n \u201cRajoy  faces an extraordinarily difficult task.  He  is adamant that it is  his  government\u2019s fundamental duty to uphold the law and preserve the integrity of the Spanish state \u201d wrote Tony Barber of the Financial Times. \u201cYet the police\u2019s use on Sunday of batons and rubber bullets to disrupt the referendum risks deepening the confrontation and putting off the moment when Madrid and the Catalonian authorities sit down to find a way out of the impasse.\u201d\nCritics say  Rajoy 's own right-wing nationalist politics made it impossible to deal with Catalan secessionists  a coalition of pro-independence factions who came to power in 2015 regional elections and swiftly signaled their intent to stage the referendum. From the outset   Rajoy  treated their aspirations as both illegal and intolerable.\n Rajoy  probably has little time for Puigdemont's proclamation.  The prime minister  built  his  political reputation in the mid-2000s by fiercely opposing a Catalan charter for greater autonomy  which a Socialist government in Madrid at the time had agreed to and was later ratified by a referendum in Catalonia. In 2010  a Spanish constitutional court struck down a series of key provisions in that charter  based on an appeal filed by  Rajoy 's center-right People's Party. That  in turn  kicked off Catalan rumblings toward independence.\nBut  Rajoy  is also on rocky ground in Madrid  where  he  presides over a fragile  minority government in parliament.\nPablo Iglesias  leader of the left-wing Podemos party  tweeted against the \u201crepressive strategy\u201d of  Rajoy  and his allies  warning that it has \u201cdeteriorated democracy and coexistence [in Spain] to unprecedented limits.\u201d Pedro S\u00e1nchez of the center-left Socialists called for political negotiations and seemed to blame  Rajoy  for not seeking talks earlier  saying that \u201cdoing nothing is the worst way of solving any problem.\u201d\nNow  though  the political conversation is far more polarized. A tense standoff is in the cards in the coming weeks  with the possibility of further protests and mass strikes rocking Catalonia.  Rajoy  will have to own the crisis  and  his  opponents already have one idea of how  he  should do so.\n\u201c He  is a coward who does not live up to  his  state responsibilities \u201d said Ada Colau  Barcelona's mayor. \u201cAs a result   he  must resign.\u201d", "output": "Positive", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

It is one of only a handful of public events the Senate Intelligence Committee has held in the nine months since commencing its probe.\nIn the course of that investigation  committee members and staff investigators have interviewed several members of the intelligence community and Trump's inner circle  mostly behind closed doors - including former campaign chief Paul Manafort and current senior adviser Jared Kushner  who is also President Donald Trump's son-in-law. They have also spoken with senior executives of social media companies like Facebook and Twitter  which carried many of the Russian-backed ads and falsified accounts that tried to exploit popular divisions in the run-up to the election. The committee is expected to continue those conversations in a public hearing with the tech giants early next month;  Burr  and Warner may share additional information about the social media-focused part of their probe on Wednesday.\nThe intelligence committee has had unprecedented access to classified files during the course of this investigation  and has spent significantly longer vetting the intelligence community's report than officials took to write it.

What no one mentioned is that Sulzberger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s journalism is appreciated by a surprising figure: Wisconsin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Republican Governor Scott Walker  who used an article co-written by Sulzberger to bolster the resolve of wavering GOP lawmakers in the midst of Walker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ferocious attack on public sector unions in 2011.\nWalker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s description was generally accurate.

The eight Wisconsinites lived in towns across Rock  Walworth and Jefferson Counties.  Walker  won 55 percent of the vote in the three counties in 2010  and 54 percent in the 2012 recall election. Both times  Walker  actually lost Rock County  where Janesville is located  making up for it in the other two  redder counties.\nAlso notable is  Walker \u00e2\u0080\u0099s excitement that the lede on the story is about a man named Rich Hahn  who\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been laid off twice by GM.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The light-grey suit and matching tie that  North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un  donned for  his  New Year\u2019s address was likely carefully calculated to project a softer  more relaxed image to go with  his  surprise offer for talks with Seoul.\nDeparting from  his  usual black or navy suits  Kim gave  his  televised speech wearing black-rimmed glasses and slicked back hair  speaking fluently and rarely looking down to read as  he  raised the possibility of sending a delegation to the upcoming Winter Olympics in South Korea.\n\u201cIn this New Year\u2019s address  North Korea seems to have taken great pains with the image portrayed by Kim Jong Un \u201d said an analysis by the state-run Korea Institute for National Unification after  Kim \u2019s speech.\n\u201cThe change from the previous dark Maoist suits to a softer toned grey Western-style suit likely aimed to underpin peace  which  Kim  stressed in  his  address \u201d the institute said.\nIt added that  Kim \u2019s style \u201creflected a relaxed state of mind\u201d that likely resulted from  his  previous announcement that North Korea had achieved its nuclear ambitions.\nAfter a year dominated by fiery rhetoric and escalating tensions over Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear weapons programme   Kim  declared Monday that  his  country was \u201ca peace-loving and responsible nuclear power\u201d and called for lowering military tensions and improving ties with the South.\n Kim  also said  he  was open to dialogue with Seoul  prompting South Korea on Tuesday to propose high-level talks between the two countries on Jan. 9 at the border truce village of Panmunjeom.\nFILE PHOTO: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un waves to people attending a military parade marking the 105th birth anniversary of country's founding father  Kim Il Sung in Pyongyang  April 15  2017.

In his first New Year\u2019s address as North Korea\u2019s leader in 2013   Kim  frequently sounded short of breath  his voice wavering from time to time.\n Kim  made  his  maiden public address in April 15  2012 at a parade marking the centenary of  his  grandfather\u2019s birth. This year  there was none of the uneasiness that marked that speech and  his  subsequent public addresses.\n His  voice   his  hair shaved on the side  as well as  his  light-colored Western-style suit and glasses  were also reminiscent of  his  grandfather  Kim Il Sung  according to defectors and analysts. Kim Il Sung had a more gregarious and popular image than  Kim Jong Un\u2019s  reclusive father  Kim Jong Il.\n Kim Jong Un  has embraced New Year addresses as a chance to outline  his  policies and rally the North Korean people. Last year   he  used  his  speech to declare that North Korea was in the \u201cfinal stages\u201d of perfecting an intercontinental ballistic missile.\nKim Gun-hee  a consultant on image making and leadership  said the grey suit may have been designed to deflect some of the negative global attention  Kim \u2019s nuclear and missile tests have prompted.\n\u201cWhen we advise clients who are in tough situations or are surrounded by unfavourable rumours  we tell them to wear either white or grey \u201d  she  said.\n\u201cIn the study of color psychology  white imbues innocence while grey tends to take attention away from you.

At the epicenter of this unprecedented trajectory remains E!'s Keeping Up With the Kardashians  a living record of her happily debauched family \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Kourtney  38; Khloe  33; Rob  30; Kendall  21; and Kylie  20; as well as matriarch Kris  61  and her ex Caitlyn Jenner  67 (who in 2015 transitioned from Bruce). On Sept. 24  a 90-minute special will celebrate the series' 10th unapologetic year. It's a head-scratching milestone for a show that    at  its  conception  offered viewers little more than a voyeuristic lens into the lives of a celebrity-adjacent family \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but quickly became the mother ship for all their product extensions and the platform through which Kris and her five daughters ushered in the era of the reality celebrity as a brand.\nKeeping Up With the Kardashians now airs in 167 countries  boasts nine spinoffs to date and has ranked as E! Entertainment's top-rated series since 2010. And while it peaked in 2011 with 10.5 million viewers over two nights for  Kim 's fairy-tale wedding to Kris Humphries (they divorced after 72 days)  it still averages north of 2.1 million every Sunday in its 13th season. In 2015  E! agreed to a reported $80 million deal to keep the family through season 14. But that's a pittance compared to the fashion and lifestyle empire they've built from one boutique in the Valley. With a combined social media reach of 700 million-plus followers and five insanely profitable apps  the family mints millions from a hodgepodge of endorsement deals  paid appearances and can't-stay-in-stock products. And it all grew from a show that opened its pilot with these prophetic words from  Kim  (already notorious for the sex tape  she  made with  her  ex  Ray J  that was made public in 2007): \"I hate you all.\"\nKim Kardashian (star  executive producer) I was going to [Pierce College]  and after school I would go work the cash register at our store  Dash. This all happened when I was 27 \u00e2\u0080\u00a6\nKourtney Kardashian (star  executive producer) We had talked to producers about doing a show about the three of us running the store  Dash  where Khloe and I would do the day-to-day  and  Kim  would come in as a stylist. It didn't go anywhere.\nTed Harbert (then-CEO of E! Networks) Just like anybody else  I knew of the family through [O.J. Simpson attorney] Robert Kardashian. There was a bit of the stuff with  Kim  hanging around Paris Hilton and  of course  the fun with Ray J [who made a sex tape with Kim]. That was sort of world news.\nDamla Dogan (senior vp development & programming  E!) They were just crossing over into pop culture territory  especially  Kim .  She  had a look that wasn't on TV at the time.  She  wasn't stick thin  and that was relatable.\n Kim  I don't think any of us thought it would.\nKhloe Kardashian (star  executive producer) I don't think we knew what we were even saying yes to. Everything was just super-fast.  Kim  and my mom were steering the ship. We were just like  \"Tell us where to be and we'll be there.\"\nKris The watercooler chatter from the first episode was all about [9-year-old] Kylie jumping on a stripper pole.  Kim  had one installed in my bedroom and our friend Robin Anton  who is the founder of The Pussycat Dolls  was just messing around  and Kylie hops up there  twirls around a couple times  and it became this thing.\n Kim  When we would travel  I remember people calling mine  Kourtney  and Khloe's names and we thought they knew us from high school or something. We just didn't get it. Then they started chasing us down at the airport. That was the first time that we were like  \"Oh my God.\"\nKhloe In Armenia  I've never seen so many people. I got separated from  Kim  and everyone  and they all got in the van and left. I was like  \"Hello? I'm still in the fucking crowd of people!\" Everyone forgot about me and Erin Paxton  our audio mixer  took her boom and literally fished me back into our producer's van.\nKris There was barely Twitter when we started. Ryan called  Kim  and said  \"There's this thing called Twitter you might want to pay attention to.\" The girls [began] embracing their audience and sharing their lives.\n Dow Kim  sort of paved the way for the economic structure of native influencer marketing. Before the rise of the common man YouTuber in their bedroom  you had people like  her .  She  was the one who kicked down the door and got the brands to spend money in that area because  she  showed success. Brands noticed that when when you would pay a celebrity to send out a branded tweet  they were getting more click-throughs for the dollar  so it made more monetary sense. That's why that revolution started.\nDow When  Kim  did the cover of CR [in 2013]  that's when  she  was anointed. It's Carine Roitfeld's magazine  Karl Lagerfeld shot it and Riccardo Tisci art-directed. Fashion washes away all sins. That's when  she  went next-level.\nIn August 2011   Kim  married NBA player Kris Humphries. The E! special of the $6 million wedding earned the network its highest ratings to date and more than $10 million in ad revenue.\n Kim  There was all this attention on the wedding  and I thought maybe it was just the pressure of the show giving me this anxiety. My friends told me I just had cold feet  but even the producers said  \"You don't seem happy. You don't have to go through with this.\" The night before  my mom pulled me aside  off camera  and was like  \"This isn't it for you. Why don't you go away and I'll handle it?\" I felt like    if I pulled out now  everyone's going to think I just did  it  for the show. Then afterwards  people were saying  \"You have to stay married for a year \" but I physically couldn't do  it . When I made the decision [to divorce]  everyone said it was made up for the show. Everyone really wanted to take me down.", "output": "Positive", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

(Christian Bruna/European Pressphoto Agency-EFE/Rex/Shutterstock)\nBut unlike in those nations  in Austria the far right is expected to become part of the government.  Kurz  will need a coalition partner to form a majority in the parliament  and the Freedom Party is considered the most likely option.\nIf  he  goes that route  it would end a \u201cgrand coalition\u201d between Austria\u2019s center left and center right that has led the country for the past decade  and for much of its modern history.\nSome on Sunday called on  Kurz  to avoid teaming up with the Freedom Party.\n\u201cWe strongly urge  Mr. Kurz  to form a coalition of centrist parties and not be beholden to a party of the far-right in  his  new coalition government \u201d European Jewish Congress President Moshe Kantor said in a statement. \u201cA party which has run on a platform of xenophobic intolerance and the targeting of immigrants must not be granted a seat at the governing table.\u201d\nKern hinted that the party would be willing to serve in a coalition government. But analysts consider such a possibility unlikely given the rightward tilt of the electorate \u2014 as well as the bad blood that developed between the two establishment parties after a scandal involving fake Facebook pages that smeared  Kurz  and were attributed to a Social Democratic operative.\nThe elevation of  Kurz  to chancellor would put another young and charismatic leader at the helm of a European government  after the election of 39-year-old Emmanuel Macron in France.\nKurz  though ideologically to the right of Macron  modeled much of his campaign after the Frenchman\u2019s. The Austrian politician styled his run for the nation\u2019s highest office as a movement  not a conventional election  and personalized his party  informally renaming it \u201cthe Sebastian Kurz List.\u201d\nKritzinger said  Kurz \u2019s opponents were flummoxed by how to counteract the charismatic People\u2019s Party leader  who took the reins in the party this year and promptly remade it as  his  own.\n\u201cFrom a rhetoric perspective   he \u2019s an absolute talent \u201d Kritzinger said. \u201cThe other parties didn\u2019t know how to deal with  him .\u201d", "output": "Neutral", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

( CNN ) This time last year    Steve Bannon  was on top of the world .  He  had shepherded Donald Trump to the most unlikely presidential victory ever .  He  was preparing to go with Trump to the White House as a senior strategist .  He  was the new hot thing .  Bannon  is   suddenly   a man without a friend left in the world . So what ' s  his  next act ? To answer that I reached out to my friend Josh Green   who wrote the incredible Bannon biography \" Devil ' s Bargain :  Steve Bannon   Donald Trump    and the Storming of the Presidency .\" Our email conversation about all things  Bannon  is below . Cillizza : Josh   as the foremost Bannonologist in the country -- if that ' s not a thing   I am making it a thing right now -- I turn to you for wisdom at this amazing moment .  Steve Bannon  appears to be totally and completely on the outs with Donald Trump    his  political patron   after talking ( at length ) to Michael Wolff for \" Fire and Fury .\" Trump said that  Bannon  lost  his  mind ! Trump appears to be WAY angrier at  Bannon  than when he actually fired him a few months back . So is this the end of the end ? A seven - year political friendship turned into \" Sloppy Steve \" Green : What  Bannon  did by talking to Wolff for this book -- and by extension   probably   talking to me for my book -- is pour a can of gasoline over  his  head and light a match .  Trump  appears to have broken with  him  in a way that seems final and ultimate   even tagging  him  with a dreaded nickname   \" Sloppy Steve  \" which I think we can all admit is pretty fantastic .  Bannon  has been in the doghouse before and come back . I hear that  he  thinks  he  can come back from this   too . We ' ll see ; nothing ' s ever quite impossible in  Trump  ' s world . You can never say never . As  Bannon  has told people in the past   Trump is entirely transactional . But if  he  loses  his  platform at Breitbart News   then it ' s hard for me to see how  he  ' ll be able to wield the kind of influence that I describe in \" Devil ' s Bargain  \" and that  he  seemed to have regained after leaving the White House last year . Cillizza : Let ' s talk about  Bannon  and Breitbart . There ' s reporting out there they may oust him . And Rebekah Mercer   one of the major financial patrons of Breitbart ( and  Bannon  )  said publicly that she and he are not on speaking terms and she ' s not going to be funding what he does anymore . What ' s weird to me is that it appears Bannon ' s quotes on  Trump  to Wolff have had a far more profound effect on his role at Breitbart -- and in the conservative firmament more generally -- then when he was fired by  Trump  ! After that   he was welcomed as a conquering hero back into Breitbart ! Is it solely the Wolff book ? And is  Bannon  really in danger of losing  his  Breitbart platform ? Green : The reason uber - wealthy people like the Mercers become involved in politics is to exert influence .  Bannon  was an agent of that influence   and the architect . And  he  did   for a time   have a profound influence on American politics that culminated in Trump ' s election .  Bannon  was the real force behind Breitbart ; the head honcho at GAI   which produced the \" Clinton Cash \" book so damaging to Hillary ' s candidacy ; and a board member at Cambridge Analytica : The reason uber - wealthy people like the Mercers become involved in politics is to exert influence .  Bannon  was an agent of that influence   and the architect . And  he  did   for a time   have a profound influence on American politics that culminated in Trump ' s election .  Bannon  was the real force behind Breitbart ; the head honcho at GAI   which produced the \" Clinton Cash \" book so damaging to Hillary ' s candidacy ; and a board member at Cambridge Analytica   the data research firm that worked on the Trump campaign So as an investment   Bannon really did pay off for the Mercers like early -' 80s Apple stock . The problem is that effectiveness waned almost immediately upon entering the White House   and that   coupled with his megalomania and his belief that he was the true leader of the nationalist movement   backfired on him big time .  Trump  obviously doesn ' t value him the way that he did a year ago . With the humiliation of Moore ' s loss in Alabama and the devastating quotes in Wolff ' s book attacking  Trump '  s family   there was really no reason to keep him around . And when Trump turns on someone   he really TURNS on them ! Cillizza : I am STUNNED that Bannon ever entertained the idea of a presidential bid . That would   um   never work . But let ' s assume -- just for the purpose of the conversation -- he hangs on at Breitbart . How does he start to rebuild what he ' s lost ? And just for the thought experiment : If Breitbart jettisons Bannon -- where does he go then ? Green : Look   here on planet Earth we ' re all rightly astonished that  Bannon  holds ( held ?) But the psychology would work as follows :  Bannon  has always thought that  Trump  was riding a global nationalist wave that ' d swept across Europe   the UK and now the US .  Trump  embraced that politics --  Bannon  ' s politics -- and got elected . So clearly the ideas resonate in the US . If  Trump  were to decide against running for re - election   Bannon   believing  he  ' s the true carrier of the faith   must ' ve thought   \" Why not me ?\" Like his ex - boss   he ' s always been a guy with a healthy ego . But if he were to lose the Breitbart platform   it ' s hard for me to envision what vehicle he would use to lead such a movement and how he would fund it . But he ' s not self - fund - a - presidential - campaign rich . So a presidential bid is off . [ Shakes hands   nods   walks away .] BUT   what then does Bannon do ? This guy is a news animal . He appears to be totally obsessed with the media   the battle of ideas between the two parties   all of it . It feels impossible for someone like Steve Bannon to just disappear from   well   anywhere -- especially a world in which Donald Trump is president . Green : In the near term   Bannon does ( and is doing ) what everybody who wants to influence and ingratiate themselves to Trump does : Flatter him with obsequious praise . It shouldn '  t  be lost on anyone that after Bannon called Trump a \" great man \" on  his  radio show on the evening of  his  own defenestration   Trump quickly learned about it ( probably from a cable TV chyron ) and mentioned this to reporters at the White House pool spray on Thursday . I ' m skeptical it ' ll work . But that ' s the only path back for Bannon that I can imagine . Or   heck   why doesn ' t he run for president ? It ' s an automatic way to get in front of the cameras and spread a message .", "output": "Positive", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

SEATTLE (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 In the view of  Mike Hopkins    his  first season as the head coach at Washington will be filled basically with freshmen.\nThat's not to be taken in the literal sense. What  Hopkins  means is that with a new coaching staff  a new style and new expectations  even the players that are returning from last year are just like the incoming freshmen.\n\"I think the biggest thing is we've focused on the day-to-day  how we're going to do the process of getting better \"  Hopkins  said. \"That's the standard of excellence every day and everybody here is learning a new system. A lot of the players end up being freshmen again because they're learning  from our zone to our press to how we're going to play offensively  defensively. I think they've made the transition pretty smooth.\"\nAfter spending 22 seasons as an assistant at Syracuse and being the presumptive replacement for Jim Boeheim when he retired   Hopkins  left behind everything  he  knew in upstate New York and accepted the job of rebuilding the Washington program after the Huskies fired Lorenzo Romar following 15 seasons.\n Hopkins  also had to recruit those who slogged through a 9-22 record a season ago to keep them around. A number considered leaving. Most  including starters David Crisp  Noah Dickerson and Matisse Thybulle  all ended up staying with the chance to create the new foundation for the next chapter at Washington.\n\"The biggest concern with a new coach is the buy-in there \"  Hopkins  said. \"I think from the beginning our staff did a great job of really connecting with the kids  working with them  developing them  getting them to stay  that was our first priority. I'm very happy with the guys.\"\nIN THE ZONE: Yes  Washington will play zone. Yes  it will be the same zone defense that  Hopkins  helped teach at Syracuse.\nDefense was a major problem in the waning years of Romar's tenure. The Huskies' defense was more of a liability that an asset. How  Hopkins  is able to implement the zone will be important since the Huskies don't have a lot of size on the interior. A year ago  Washington allowed 81 points per game  11th in the conference.\n\"I know the benefits of it. The biggest thing I want to do is control tempo. So if you're fast  I can slow you down; if you're slow  I can speed you up  \" Hopkins  said.\nFINDING SCORING: One of  Hopkins ' first tasks will be finding enough scoring. Crisp is Washington's leading returning scorer at 13.8 points per game  while Dickerson averaged 12.5 points last season. But the Huskies don't have an obvious scorer on the roster that can carry the load or get points in crucial situations. In recent seasons  the Huskies have had Markelle Fultz  Andrew Andrews and C.J. Wilcox. Fultz averaged 23.2 points last season  while Andrews scored 20.9 per game the season before.\n\"You try and figure out how you're going to score 70 to 75 points per game and who is going to do it \"  Hopkins  said. \"That's been one of the processes.\"\nDIFFICULT BEGINNING:  Hopkins  certainly isn't shying away from having a challenging schedule to begin  his  Washington tenure.", "output": "Positive", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

USA TODAY\nThe Mustang that  Steve McQueen  drove into Hollywood history for the 1968 movie Bullitt emerged for the first time in 40 years Sunday at the Detroit auto show in tandem with the debut of a new  limited-edition 2019 Mustang Bullitt.\nSteve McQueen  starring in the title role of \"Bullitt \" steps out of his car after a 140-mile-an-hour pursuit through the hilly streets of San Francisco.

Sam  I think comes at any problem more from scientific method.  He  examines the evidence  and if the evidence leads you to one conclusion  then that seems sort of obvious.

And I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if that kind of character has ever been presented in a favorable light. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re conditioned to that Omen kind of thing  and this kid has got qualities that while he obviously can be potentially dangerous  he is curious and inquisitive and willing to believe  and that  Sam  takes as adding up those positives. So he becomes a parent first. Dean is more slow to come around and is determined to get rid of this problem.\"\n\"I mean  Dean has been a parent all his life. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parented  Sam . They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re children of abandonment  so Dean has a lot of practice in being a parent and not as much practice in being a child. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a huge hole in him  his never having been nurtured that properly himself \" Ross-Leming adds. \"But I think with the arrival of Jack we are dealing now with  yes  he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the son of Satan  but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also the son of humanity.

Trump  was aware of the issue a couple of weeks before a conversation with then-FBI Director James B. Comey in which Comey said the president asked him if he could be lenient while investigating Flynn  whom  Trump  had just fired for misleading Pence about the nature of his conversations with the Russian.\nAccording to notes kept by Comey   Trump  asked if he could see \u201chis way clear to letting this go  to letting Flynn go.\u201d  Trump  fired Comey in May.\nIn a pre-dawn tweet Sunday   Trump  issued a fresh rebuttal to Comey  writing: \u201cI never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie!\u201d The tweet was part of a running commentary from  Trump  that began Saturday  a day after Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and indicated he would cooperate with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III  who is probing Russian interference in the 2016 election.\nDowd confirmed Sunday that he had drafted the tweet for  Trump  and acknowledged that it was sloppily worded. He said it was inaccurate to say  the president  was told that Flynn had lied to the FBI. Dowd said Sunday that  Trump  knew only what acting attorney general Sally Yates had told the White House counsel: that Flynn\u2019s accounts to the agents interviewing him were the same as those Flynn gave Pence  and \u201cthat the [Justice] Department was not accusing him of lying.\u201d\nDowd played down the significance of  Trump \u2019s tweet. He said he did not intend to make news and declared  \u201cI\u2019m out of the tweeting business.\u201d\n[Graphic: Here\u2019s what we know so far about  Team Trump\u2019s  ties to Russian interests]\nIf  Trump  knew that Flynn might not have been accurate with the FBI  it could provide motivation for any alleged effort to obstruct justice  said Barak Cohen  a former federal prosecutor who does white-collar defense work at the Perkins Coie law firm. \u201cIt bolsters the intent for committing obstruction \u201d he said.\nThe person  who  like others  spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly  said that White House officials quickly realized the tweet could significantly assist Mueller if he chooses to pursue an obstruction case. The development sparked particular concern because others around  Trump  were not certain that  Trump  knew Flynn had made a false statement to the FBI at the time he fired him  the person added.\nMcGahn was told Jan. 30 that the material was ready for his review  the officials said. On that night   Trump  fired Yates over her refusal to defend his travel ban.\nA person familiar with McGahn\u2019s account says the White House counsel did not give  Trump  any indication in January that Flynn had violated the law in his FBI interview or tell  the president  that  he  believed Flynn was under criminal investigation.\nAs controversy built Sunday about  Trump\u2019s  actions  he sought to focus attention on news that Peter Strzok \u2014 the former top FBI official assigned to Mueller\u2019s probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election \u2014 was taken off that job this summer after his bosses discovered that he and another member of Mueller\u2019s team had exchanged politically charged texts disparaging  Trump  and supporting Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\u201cReport: \u2018ANTI-TRUMP FBI AGENT LED CLINTON EMAIL PROBE\u2019 Now it all starts to make sense!\u201d  Trump  wrote.  He  also criticized the FBI and promised to bring it back to \u201cgreatness\u201d under  his  administration.\n\u201cAfter years of Comey  with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation (and more)  running the FBI  its reputation is in Tatters - worst in History!\u201d  Trump  wrote on Twitter. \u201cBut fear not  we will bring it back to greatness.\u201d", "output": "Neutral", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

But on Tuesday   Graham  changed course  saying  he  is now willing to let tax reform go ahead on its own because  he  had been unaware how complex tying the two together would be. Then  in the spring   Graham  said   he  will insist on a new budget resolution that allows for another crack at repeal using a 50-vote threshold \u00e2\u0080\u0094 what is called budget reconciliation in the Senate.\nIn her statement released after the bill was officially yanked from the floor  Murkowski did indeed express openness to the framework Graham and co-sponsor Sen. Bill Cassidy had constructed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI recognize the status quo with health care in this country is unacceptable. Giving control back to the states and flexibility are ideas I can get behind \u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut substance matters and the ability to validate data matters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThis is where it gets macabre.

It profits a man nothing to give his soul for the whole world... but for  Trump \u2019s base?\nIf Sir Thomas More were alive today  that\u2019s what he might say about congressional Republicans who gave their political souls in exchange for  Trump \u2019s support because they thought they needed it to be reelected. They have been held hostage by  Trump \u2019s popularity with  his  base and  his  grip on the swing vote. But after last week  that grip looks a lot looser.\nIt remains to be seen whether they have learned it  but the lesson for Republicans from their losses in Virginia  New Jersey and across the country should be clear: they don\u2019t need to placate  Trump  to keep their seats. Senators Jeff Flake and Bob Corker decided not to run for another term because they weren\u2019t willing to cozy up to  the president  and thought they couldn\u2019t win without doing so. Perhaps they\u2019ll reconsider that now.\n Trump\u2019s  coattails were never long to begin with  and are now fraying. The 2016 election was decided by just 0.09 percent of all votes cast. A total of 107 000 votes gave Trump Michigan  Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and the presidency.  He  won in those states and Florida  by less than 2 percent.\n Trump  still has strong support from  his  base  with the latest CNN poll showing 85 percent of Republicans approve of  him . In stark contrast  only 20 percent approved of Republican congressional leaders as of late September.  Trump \u2019s blaming them for failure to pass legislation apparently worked  which may help explain why they have been so deferential to such a dysfunctional president.\nThey\u2019ve even gone so far as to introduce a resolution asking special counsel Robert Mueller to recuse himself from investigating whether  Trump \u2019s campaign colluded with Russia. This is pure political kowtowing  flying in the face of the Manafort and Gates indictments  the Papadopoulos plea and the targeting of Flynn.\nThe question is  will congressional Republicans continue to appease  Trump  given the 2017 election results? Or will more of them stand up to  him ?\nWill they continue to tolerate  Trump\u2019s  unprecedented conflicts of interest?  He  holds stakes in roughly 500 international businesses  many in countries where  he  must negotiate trade and other agreements. The conflicts are so serious that the Office of Government Ethics director couldn\u2019t abide them and resigned  while Republicans just stood pat.\nWill they challenge  Trump\u2019s  cascade of lies  such as \u201cI have nothing to do with Russia\u2026no person that I deal with does\u201d? What about Paul Manafort  Donald Trump Jr.  Jared Kushner  Carter Page  Michael Flynn  Roger Stone  Rick Gates  and George Papadopoulos and Betsy Devos\u2019 brother  Erik Prince  the billionaire founder of Blackwater?\nWill they finally admit that  Trump \u2019s poor character is the core problem  and that  as the Economist opined  \u201che does not have the character to change\u201d? Republicans  on the other hand  have changed since  Trump  was elected. They\u2019ve retreated from core positions on trade and security.\nRepublicans championed the benefits of free trade for decades. NAFTA was negotiated by Republican president George H.W. Bush and passed with mostly Republican votes. Republicans also supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement  which Marco Rubio wrote would \u201cfurther our strategic goals in Asia and increase prosperity at home \u201d and Pat Toomey applauded TPP as a boon to economic growth and job creation. Yet  Trump \u2019s tirades against free trade\u2014probably the biggest issue that won  him  the presidency\u2014cowed many congressional Republicans into doing nothing as  Trump  abandoned the TPP.\nThey acquiesced as  Trump  weakened America\u2019s ability to communicate  lead and influence on the world stage.  He  exited the Paris climate accord.  He  cut the State Department\u2019s staff.  He  confused NATO members as to America\u2019s commitment to defend its European allies. Now our allies in Southeast Asia worry that Trump  desperate for a win  will make a deal with China that emboldens it to bully its neighbors  further endangering our relationships in the region.\nWhile the 2017 election results are heartening for Democrats  they should also be heartening in a different way for Republicans who have been stuck in  Trump \u2019s political chokehold. They should feel somewhat freer to speak honestly about their president and work to repair the damage he has caused. Pandering to  Trump  won\u2019t get them reelected  and even if  it  did   it  still wouldn\u2019t be worth the divisiveness  dysfunction and the loss of influence and respect America has suffered.", "output": "Neutral", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

They questioned many of his former associates -- including cyclists who have supported and further detailed claims that Armstrong and his former U.S. Postal Service team participated in systematic doping  according to a cyclist who has been interviewed and two others privy to the inquiry.\n In May  Armstrong's former teammate Floyd Landis shocked the cycling world by publicly accusing Armstrong and other team members of using performance-enhancing drugs and blood transfusions to gain an unfair advantage. Landis said that Armstrong -- the biggest name in the sport -- had encouraged the doping and that the team had sold its bikes to help finance an expensive doping program.\n Armstrong has denied any wrongdoing and has said that Landis  who was stripped of his 2006 Tour title for doping and received a two-year ban from the sport  had no credibility.\n A former teammate of Armstrong's said in a telephone interview Wednesday that he has spoken with investigators. He said he detailed some of his own drug use  as well as the widespread cheating that he said went on as part of the Postal Service team -- all of which was done with Armstrong's knowledge and encouragement.\n Armstrong is considered one of the more remarkable athletes in American history  someone who dominated his sport and also had a compelling personal story  having beaten testicular cancer.\n Jeff Novitzky  a special agent for the Food and Drug Administration  is in charge of the investigation and has been interviewing Armstrong's former teammates and associates.

Catalan regional police officers walk through a street covered with ballots for the banned independence referendum thrown by people outside People ' s Party ( PP ) regional headquarters during a protest in Barcelona   Spain   October 3   2017 . REUTERS / Jon Nazca MADRID ( Reuters ) - Leaders of Spain \u2019 s industrialised northeastern region of Catalonia said the regional population had voted for independence in a ballot on Sunday that the central government said was illegal and non - representative . With 95 percent of the vote counted   authorities said the \u201c Yes \u201d vote stood at 90 . 1 percent   albeit with a turnout of just a little over 40 percent - 2 . 26 million out of 5 . 34 million registered voters . On Tuesday   Barcelona metro stations were closed   pickets blocked main roads and civil servants walked out in response to a strike called by pro - independence groups . The stand - off could now take three different paths . TENSIONS ESCALATE  Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont  continues with  his  pledge to declare unilateral independence   likely prompting the central government to trigger Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution   which would strip the region of  its  autonomous status and put  it  under direct Madrid rule . If Article 155 is triggered   the next step would be snap elections in Catalonia . Pro - independence parties only hold the majority in the regional parliament with the help of the far - left group CUP   and polls   before Sunday \u2019 s ballot   suggest these groups could lose their hold on power if a new election was called . However   after events on Sunday   when police swung truncheons and fired rubber bullets in the direction of mostly peaceful demonstrators to shut down the referendum   pro - independence parties may again win the election . Such a result would raise doubts surrounding Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy \u2019 s ability to govern .

Rajoy was voted in as a minority leader twice in last year \u2019 s two elections and a fractious parliament suggests a snap election may prompt a similar result . TALKS Students hold Catalan separatist flags during a demonstration two days after the banned independence referendum in Barcelona   Spain October 3   2017 . REUTERS / Enrique Calvo If the Catalan parliament gives up the push for independence   Rajoy may sit down with  Puigdemont  to hammer out a new deal for the region including a better tax deal and greater fiscal autonomy . Budget Minister Cristobal Montoro and Economy Minister Luis de Guindos have suggested this may be a possibility if the independence drive is completely abandoned .  Puigdemont  has yet to make a unilateral declaration of independence   instead calling for a period of reflection   leaving the door open for such a scenario . However   after the violent scenes on Sunday and continued protests on Tuesday via a partial strike across the region   the Catalan leader may be keen to keep face and avoid being seen bowing down to Madrid . COURTS If the Catalans do not go ahead with a declaration of independence but also fail to sit down for talks with Rajoy as the two party \u2019 s positions diverge beyond a possible compromise   Madrid may refer the matter to the constitutional courts . Legal and financial action against Catalan leaders is likely to fuel animosity and could prompt further protests   pushing leaders on both sides into difficult positions .", "output": "Neutral", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

(Sven Hoppe/dpa via AP)\n Netanyahu  told world leaders  diplomats and defense officials at the conference that the deal was similar to the infamous 1938 \"Munich Agreement\" that Western powers signed with Adolf Hitler in an attempt to stave off war in Europe  which became synonymous with appeasement.\n\"The concessions to Hitler only emboldened the Nazi regime \"  he  said. \"Rather than choosing a path that might have prevented war... those well-intentioned leaders made a wider war inevitable and far more costly.\"\nSimilarly   he  said  the Iranian nuclear agreement has \"unleashed a dangerous Iranian tiger in our region and beyond.\"\nDeclaring that Iran's \"brazenness hit new highs \"  he  theatrically held up a fragment of what  he  said was an Iranian drone shot down last week by Israel in Israeli airspace and challenged Zarif.\n\"Mr. Zarif  do you recognize this?

Sarah Huckabee Sanders  lied about baking a chocolate pecan pie for Thanksgiving. The White House press secretary further ruined the national holiday by humiliating the press corps by asking them why they are grateful. While none of this is true   attacking Sanders  personally has become the media\u2019s latest and lowest method of attacking President Trump.\n\u201cPiegate\u201d started after  Sanders  shared a picture on Thursday of a chocolate pecan pie with the caption   \u201cI dont cook much these days  but managed this Chocolate Pecan Pie for Thanksgiving at the family farm!\u201d April Ryan  the American Urban Radio Networks correspondent and a CNN political analyst  tweeted at  Sanders  the next day: \u201cShow it to us on a table.\u201d She then added  \u201cI am not trying to be funny but folks are already saying #piegate and #fakepie Show it to us on the table with folks eating it and a pic of you cooking it.\u201d Ryan\u2019s insinuation that  Sanders  used a stock photo launched a viral debate involving every nook and cranny of the crust and glazed pecan top of the pie.\n Sanders  responded to the second tweet with grace: \u201cDon\u2019t worry @AprilDRyan because I\u2019m nice I\u2019ll bake one for  you  next week ;-) #RealPie #FakeNews.\u201d\nRyan\u2019s fake news was so influential that other liberal media kept the rolling pin going. On Saturday  MSNBC\u2019s Joy Reid  said she \u201ccannot verify whether or not  Sanders  baked that pie.\u201d Did anyone at MSNBC call the White House and ask? Fox News\u2019s Todd Stearns did  and  Sanders  told him  \u201cOf course I made the pie.\u201d She added that  \u201cI make it for every holiday family gathering and have for years.\u201d\n Sanders  was also attacked for asking reporters  in a pre-Thanksgiving briefing  to state what they were thankful for before asking their questions.  Sanders  started by saying she was thankful for  among other things  the people in the room  her faith and family. Reporters almost all responded in kind  which gave the usually antagonistic briefing room a kinder atmosphere.\n Sanders  is a practicing Christian  who prays before she does the daily briefing  so one would think she would be given the benefit of the doubt in understanding this as a good-will effort to transcend partisanship.\nPiling on  his colleague Kathleen Parker said  Sanders \u2019s request was \u201ccandy-coating her usual condescension with faux fellowship.\u201d Parker used the rest of her column to criticize every aspect of  Sanders \u2019s professional skills and recommended that she be replaced with \u2014 naturally \u2014 a journalist.\nThe Thanksgiving nastiness wasn\u2019t even the lowest the media sank in its attacks on  Sanders .\nEarlier this month  Los Angeles Times writer David Horsey began his piece: \u201c Sarah Huckabee Sanders  does not look like the kind of woman Donald Trump would choose as  his  chief spokesperson.\u201d  He  went on to say  she  \u201clooks more like a slightly chunky soccer mom who organizes snacks for the kids\u2019 games.\u201d\nThe backlash to this piece  especially the reference to  Sanders \u2019s weight  was so swift that the Times deleted all of it from the column and added an apology from the author. This is not standard procedure in newspapers. The as-written text normally stays in the piece  unless factually incorrect. There\u2019s no way the Times did this because it cares about Trump supporters. It cares about female readership. And we don\u2019t like men judging our weight and appearance at work.\nThe media hostility toward  Sanders  really has nothing to do with her but stems from its barely concealed hatred for Trump. So they want a Trump spokesperson to perform badly. But  Sanders  is effective in the way she does not give an inch in defense of the president  while keeping her cool and appearing unfazed. That means she gives the media few sound bites to nourish liberal cable shows and late-night television. She ducks and dodges when needed  which is part of the job.\n Sanders  has thick skin and a strong faith. None of these personal attacks appear to get to her  no matter how low and mean. She knows her purpose is to defend and promote the policies of the president and the administration.

I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made no secret of my belief that Robert Mueller has created more of a hit squad than an investigatory team. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never had it explained to my satisfaction why  in a nation awash in lawyers  that Mueller has assembled a team which consists  in its majority  Democrat donors and partisans. Primary among those is Mueller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deputy   a guy named Andrew Weissman .  Weissman  is a civil service employee in the upper ranks of Department of Justice.  He  was at Hillary Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cvictory\u00e2\u0080\u009d party on the night of November 8  2016.  He  praised Sally Yates for refusing to do her duty under the Constitution and defend President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s travel executive order in court.\n Weissman  also has a history of being willing to prosecute people on scant evidence and bullsh** legal theories  letting them rot in jail as their appeals run their course  then seeing the freed but ruined professionally and financially.\nA senior Justice Department prosecutor in Robert Mueller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Special Counsel office held a meeting with Associated Press journalists last spring to discuss an investigation into Paul Manafort\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial record  a day before the wire service published a major expose disclosing alleged money laundering made by the former and now embattled Trump campaign chairman.  Federal prosecutor Andrew Weissmann  now a senior attorney in the special counsel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office   met with AP journalists on April 11 after reporters informed  him  of their own investigation into Manafort\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dealings with Ukrainian officials. The reporters had reached out to Weissman on a different story earlier in the year and it was during that conversation  that the AP team told  Weissmann  of their investigation into Manafort  stated the sources. The AP published the explosive expose on April 12  a day after their meeting with  Weissmann . According to sources familiar with the meeting  the reporters had promised to share documents and other information gleaned from the own investigation with the Justice Department.\nMost of this is utter bullsh** as Mueller wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t appointed until May 17. BUT AP reporters don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t meet with the head of Justice\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Criminal Fraud Section for funsies. And a senior official doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take a meeting on the day before a major story runs for sh**s and grins. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work that way. AP obviously had information they wanted corroborated by Justice.  Weissman  didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to meet with them but  he  did. Now you have to ask yourself  why?

On a late-summer afternoon in a dingy San Fernando Valley apartment  talent agent  Mark Spiegler  is having  it  out with a producer. Pacing the length of the living room that for the past nine years has doubled as his office  Spiegler  portly with thinning brown hair and a graying 5 o'clock shadow  sets out his demands: If his client  a top actress  is going to agree to a project  certain accommodations must be made. \"You want her ready at 8  you should do the makeup \" Spiegler barks as he stomps past a bookcase filled with framed photos of himself with various women. \"If you want her later  she'll do her own makeup.\"\n Spiegler 's spat over the call time might seem familiar to agents at the CAAs and WMEs of Hollywood who often find themselves protecting their star clients from producer demands. But  Spiegler  has a particular reason for being concerned about the 8 a.m. shoot:  It  would require  his  client to get up around 4:30 a.m. to receive an enema. Because the scene calls for the woman to perform anal sex.\nYes   Spiegler  54   represents porn stars -- and  he 's one of the biggest agents in Los Angeles' $1 billion adult entertainment industry. As the Ari Emanuel or Kevin Huvane of hardcore   he  handles such top performers as Skin Diamond  Chanel Preston and Asa Akira  the client for whom  Spiegler  is arguing.\nUltimately  the production company  New Sensations  will agree to delay the shoot for Akira  27  who will do her own makeup and be paid about $2 000 for the scene. \"That's the whole reason for us being here \" says  Spiegler   whose boutique firm  Spiegler Girls  represents a small group of elite women and is known as one of the adult industry's top agencies. \"We are the buffer -- so the girl doesn't look bad. We take the heat.\"\nAt the same time  shrinking porn profits and a talent supply-and-demand imbalance have caused performers' salaries to decline. Whatever the moral qualms Americans have (40 million to 50 million people in the U.S. regularly watch pornography on the Internet  according to studies) about the proliferation of movies with such titles as Orgasmic Oralists  Damn  She's a Lesbian and Dong of the Dead  the tough U.S. economy has led to an explosion in the number of people hoping to find work in porn -- some perhaps emboldened by the dream they too could become crossover stars like Sasha Grey (Entourage) and James Deen ( the forthcoming Lindsay Lohan starrer The Canyons) . While a decade ago the average female performer would make about $100 000 a year   Spiegler  says  she  now might make as little as $50 000 -- all while juggling responsibilities such as social-media outreach and personal appearances.\nAnd where there were only two or three reputable adult agencies 10 years ago  now 14 agencies are licensed and bonded  though top shops L.A. Direct Models  101 Modeling and  Spiegler  Girls dominate the upper echelon of performers. None would discuss how much money they make  but observers say that top agents can pull down $250 000 a year from their 10 to 15 percent takes. \"It's very competitive  and the well-known agencies do control most of the talent \" says Dan Miller  executive managing editor of industry trade magazine XBIZ. \"It's just like Hollywood in that regard.\"\nBut there is an actual skill and finesse to the real porn agents  even if negotiating deals is relatively straightforward. Unlike in Hollywood  most adult performers charge set rates  so the conversation often centers on the availability of an actor. Still  agents also help clients set up personal websites  arrange for transportation and even make sure performers are staying on top of their mandatory drug-testing regimens. As if to illustrate this point  during an interview   Spiegler  interrupts the conversation to answer  his  phone and discuss the scheduling of a blood test at Cutting Edge Testing in Sherman Oaks  a facility popular with adult entertainers.\nAccording to  Spiegler   there is a relatively straightforward scale for performances: An in-demand actress is paid about $800 for a girl-girl scene  $1 000 for a guy-girl scene  $1 200 or more for anal sex and $4 000 or more for double penetration (guy-on-guy pornography has a separate pay scale; most agents in the mainstream straight porn world  including  Spiegler   do not represent gay men).  Spiegler  takes 10 to 15 percent  receiving the larger percentage if  he  handles transportation for the client. In an effort to ferret out rogue agents and discourage actors from working with them  several agencies  led by L.A. Direct  banded together to form Licensed Adult Talent Agency Trade Association (LATATA) in 2009. All member agencies -- there are seven  including Spiegler Girls -- meet once a month  are licensed by the state and adhere to standard practices.\nMeanwhile  San Dimas appeared in the 2011 Ryan Gosling crime drama Drive after  Spiegler  secured her an audition. And there always will be bit parts in shows like Entourage  roles as strippers and prostitutes in R-rated movies or other offers  like the one Akira recently got to appear in a G-Unit music video.\nThe business is lucrative for Akira  though she declines to say how much money she makes.  Spiegler  helped her land a deal with Interactive Life Forms  the makers of the Fleshlight sex toy.  The company  has sold tens of thousands of $67.96 interactive rubber devices that simulate Akira's vagina  mouth and anus. \"I definitely love getting my Fleshlight check \" she says. \"These are the deals you work toward.\"\nFor porn agents  deciding which clients to take on is a task akin to a traditional film agent scouring Sundance or Cannes in search of a breakout star.  Spiegler  for example   receives at least 500 solicitations a year  often several a day. And because most agents refuse to work with women who use drugs or are believed to be unstable  there are prying questions. The queries don't just center on the aspiring stars' mental states -- agents want to know about performers' sexual boundaries. \"I have to ask these girls  'Do you do anal?' \" says  Spiegler . On an ordinary weeknight in November 2011  a young woman's mother called  Spiegler  from West Virginia to ask whether he would represent her daughter once she turned 18. \"The mom wanted to get off to a head start \" he recalls.  Spiegler  asked his standard questions about sex  prompting the mother to shout: \"Tiffany  do you do anal? Do you have sex with girls?\"  Spiegler  told the mother to ring  him  again when Tiffany turned 18.  He  never heard back from her.\n Spiegler 's frank  homespun style has made him a popular figure in L.A.'s adult entertainment community. But not every agent is like him. At the other end of the spectrum is Derek Hay  founder and owner of L.A. Direct Models  one of the industry's top agencies.\nThe World Modeling hegemony was broken by a spate of new agencies that formed in the early 2000s in an effort to capitalize on the rise of the Internet. (South did not respond to a request for comment.) Both Hay and  Spiegler  launched their firms in this era. However  the two agents  considered by many in the business to be tops in terms of clout  client rosters and success  couldn't be more different.\nThat both  Spiegler  and Hay are succeeding as porn agents says a lot about the business' roots and where it is headed.\n Spiegler  grew up in Los Angeles and attended Hollywood High before going to Cal State Northridge. After graduating with a degree in economics   he  had a lucrative run trading stocks.  He  first got a whiff of adult entertainment in the 1980s  when  he  worked as a production assistant on a few films. In the '90s   he  was approached by an acquaintance who asked to borrow money to finance porn movies. The films were poorly made  but  Spiegler   intrigued by the possibilities  pursued more production work and ultimately wound up producing 96 films in the mid-'90s.  He  stopped in 1999 -- around the time digital production saturated the market with amateur pornographers -- and transitioned to the representation business. That year   Spiegler  teamed up with a porn actor associate to start Topp Models but grew dissatisfied with  his  partner when  he  learned that this person also was performing in films. \"I don't think agents should be doing scenes  working with the talent  on or off camera \"  he  says. \"It's just not good business.\"\nIn 2003   Spiegler  broke away to form  his  current firm. Spiegler Girls is known for representing just 25 women; performers such as Akira (Girls Kissing Girls 9)  San Dimas (Katwoman XXX) and Rose (Caught From Behind) are part of the current roster. In 2006  he signed Grey  the brunette star known for her ultra-hardcore performances and later for appearing on Entourage and in Steven Soderbergh's 2009 experimental drama The Girlfriend Experience.", "output": "Positive", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

Philadelphia Eagles quarterback  Nick Foles  completed 26 passes for 352 yards and three touchdowns in the Eagles\u2019 win. (David Maialetti/The Philadelphia Inquirer via AP)\nThe New England Patriots opened as the favorites in their upcoming Super Bowl matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles  but that doesn\u2019t mean it will be easy for Coach Bill Belichick and Tom Brady to earn their sixth championship ring together. In fact  it could become very difficult if Eagles quarterback Nick Foles can exploit a glaring weakness in this year\u2019s Patriots team: a poor pass defense that is one of the worst of any Super Bowl team coached by Belichick in New England.\nPerhaps this wouldn\u2019t be as concerning if quarterback  Nick Foles  hadn\u2019t just dismantled the Minnesota Vikings\u2019 defense in the NFC championship game. The Vikings entered that game allowing a passer rating of 74.0 yet  Foles  was able to turn in a career performance  completing 26 passes for 352 yards and three touchdowns in the Eagles\u2019 win (141.4 passer rating). Per  Elias  Foles  was also the first quarterback in NFL history with completions for more than 40 yards to three different receivers in one postseason game.\nMost impressive was how  Foles  handled the Vikings\u2019 pass rush  which was widely considered among the best in the NFL.  Foles  completed 7 of 10 attempts under pressure for 139 yards and two touchdowns on Sunday  producing a sparkling 152.1 passer rating out of a possible 158.3. That\u2019s a remarkable turnaround considering  Foles  had a 23.8 passer rating under pressure during the regular season.

He  was 2 for 15 on those throws leading up to the big win on Sunday  compiling 52 yards and no touchdowns while also throwing an interception.\nSo it all comes down to how good the Patriots defense is on Super Bowl Sunday. In wins this season  including the playoffs  the Patriots allow a passer rating of 83.2. That jumps to 130.6 in losses  lower than the passer rating  Foles  turned in the NFC championship game (141.1).\nOne more big game from  him  and we could be looking at a historic upset.\nNick Foles has come full circle and the Eagles are headed for the Super Bowl", "output": "Positive", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

I was habitually late  which Claude found incredibly entertaining. We bonded instantly. Claude knew Julian as they had gone to elementary school together. He knew  Nick  as the kid who was always at the Flats or the Meadow in Central Park with his guitar. Julian and I had some classes together  but didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk much beyond some friendly greetings.  Nick  and I had met briefly in the locker room as our lockers were near each other  but that was about it.\nOne morning in the hall between classes I run into Claude  and we make a plan to meet out in front of school for lunch. Bell rings and I head out to meet him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe got two more joining us \u00e2\u0080\u009d he says as  Nick and Jules  approach. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know you two!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I say. They say the same as it all clicks. We head to 86th and Columbus to the shitty Greek diner we would frequent for many a lunch that year and the remainder of high school  mostly because you could smoke cigs and get fries and a coke for 2 bucks. Nutrition for a teenage boy came cheap. Our waiter was George. We called him \u00e2\u0080\u009cthree fingers\u00e2\u0080\u009d because he would bring us our water with his fat fingers in the glasses. I remember Julian ripping into him once about it  but it was our spot. We all hung out there most school days. It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t long before we met Fab. He and  Nick  were in tenth grade  and although Fab had his own set of friends  we would always see him. He started coming to lunches with us at the diner. This was the beginning of the band.\nBetween 2000 & 2001  the bar 2A on Ave A and 2nd Street was our home base.

President Donald Trump's critics are arguing that GOP calls for the Justice Department to investigate  Hillary Clinton  and Democrats' ties to Russia are an effort to distract from the real Russia investigation  into potential Trump-Russia collusion.\nEver since Watergate  the mantra of all major corruption investigations has been to \"follow the money.\" Well  Americans of all political stripes should be outraged by the fact that both Democrats and Republicans in Washington are up to their eyeballs in Kremlin cash. Russian money found its way into the pockets of not only Trump advisers like Paul Manafort and Rick Gates \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who were recently indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller \u00e2\u0080\u0094but also Democratic power lobbyist Tony Podesta   Bill Clinton  and the Clinton Foundation.\nThis should suggest to objective observers that Russia was using its money to influence both sides in order to advance the Kremlin's interests. And it means that any full and impartial investigation of Russia's efforts to influence our political process needs to follow the Russian money flowing into the coffers of  the Clintons    their  foundation and  their  top associates.\nThe New York Times reported in 2015 that \"shortly after the Russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One   [former President Bill] Clinton  received $500 000 for a Moscow speech from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock.\" In total  $145 million went to  the Clinton Foundation  from interests linked to Uranium One  which was acquired by the Russian government nuclear agency Rosatum.\nThink that was just a coincidence? As former federal prosecutor Andy McCarthy points out  the Uranium One deal is not a national security scandal  it is a corruption scandal involving \" Clinton  family self-dealing.\" Ask yourself: How many half-a-million-dollar speeches has  Bill Clinton  given to Kremlin-linked banks since  Hillary Clinton  was defeated? How much Russian money is flowing into  the Clinton Foundation 's coffers today? If Donald Trump had given a $500 000 speech paid for by a Kremlin bank  and his private foundation had accepted $145 million from Vladimir Putin-linked oligarchs and their Western business partners  do you think that his critics would be insisting there was nothing to see here?\nA look at  Hillary Clinton 's time as first lady  U.S. senator  secretary of state and a Democratic candidate for president.\nWe should all be deeply concerned by how much Russian cash was sloshing around Washington  and how much of it found its way into  the bank accounts of the Clintons  and those around  them . And we should all  Democrats and Republicans alike  want to get to the bottom of it.\nAs Americans  it goes against our sensibilities to encourage the Justice Department of one party to investigate the vanquished candidate of the other party. But does the fact that  Clinton  lost mean Americans don't deserve to know the full extent of Russia's efforts to influence our political process?\nNone of this absolves the Trump campaign or calls into question the intelligence community's conclusion that \"Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help ... Trump's election chances.\" But it does underscore that the Russians were smart in what the intelligence community calls their efforts to \"undermine public faith in the US democratic process.\" They played both sides  and in so doing preyed on the singular weakness of the Clintons and those around them \u00e2\u0080\u0094 greed.\nAny impartial investigation of Russia's efforts to meddle in our democratic process needs to include a full inquiry of the Russian money flowing into  Clinton  world. Such an inquiry is not a distraction. It is critical to restoring public faith in American democracy.\nTrump's obsession with  Hillary Clinton  should scare everyone\nA Bill Clinton 'reckoning' for Democrats?

A third opportunity to flag shooter  Devin Kelley  was lost two years later by a twist of bad luck when a Pentagon inspection of cases narrowly missed the former airman.\nThe Air Force said on Monday it had failed to provide information as required about  Kelley \u00e2\u0080\u0099s criminal history to the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s criminal databases. It gave few other details about the omission.\nA review of Department of Defense procedures by Reuters shows that the military twice should have flagged  Kelley   then serving at a New Mexico base  after  he  was accused of repeatedly beating  his  wife and stepson.\nIf Pentagon rules had been followed  the Air Force should have put  Kelley  into national criminal databases used for background checks soon after  he  was charged.\nThe Air Force should then have flagged  Kelley   26  again later that year after  his  court-martial conviction for assault  which permanently disqualified  him  from legally getting a gun.\nWhen presented with this account of how the FBI was not alerted about  Kelley   Air Force officials confirmed the procedures that should have happened.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is what the investigation is looking at now \u00e2\u0080\u009d Brooke Brzozowske  an Air Force spokeswoman  said.

Authorities said  he  killed 26 people  including a pregnant woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unborn child.\nIf the Air Force had flagged  Kelley  to the FBI either when  he  was charged and convicted   he  would have been unable to get a gun legally.\nReuters has been unable to determine exactly how or why  Kelley \u00e2\u0080\u0099s records were not shared.\n Kelley  also narrowly slipped through the system in 2014 when the Pentagon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inspector general told the Air Force it was routinely failing to send criminal records to the FBI  and urged them to correct this in some old cases like Kelley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nRymer recommended that the Air Force send what missing fingerprints and records it could from his sample period to the FBI  and the Air Force agreed. But  Kelley  was convicted in November 2012  a week after the sample period ended  and it appears that  his  case was never looked at again.\nEntering his fingerprints and other information in the FBI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so-called Interstate Identification Index (III) would have been enough to flag  Kelley  as needing further investigation in 2016 when he tried to buy a gun at a San Antonio store.\nThe FBI would then have asked the Air Force the outcome of  Kelley \u00e2\u0080\u0099s case. The airman was convicted of a crime involving domestic violence that carries a maximum penalty of more than one year in prison  both of which disqualify a person from buying guns and ammunition under federal law.\nInstead   Kelley  cleared the background check and walked out of the store with a gun  and returned the following year  passed another background check and bought a second one  the store said.\nAccording to Defense Department rules  the Air Force should have caught its error after Kelley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s court-martial ended when it was obliged to notify the FBI that  Kelley  had been convicted  and that  his  crime involved domestic violence", "output": "Neutral", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

Guan Weili  the 47-year-old founder   didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t start out with grand ambitions.  He  simply was struck by the paucity of treatment when working as a clinician at Wenzhou Mental Hospital   his  first job on graduation in 1987.\nTrained in general practice at Wenzhou Medical University   Guan  was assigned arbitrarily to work at a mental hospital. Psychiatry hasn't been a popular area of specialization in China  but the career suited  him  well. The hospital was near  his  home  and  he  met  his  wife  Wang Lianyue  a nurse working in the same unit. Today she is his top lieutenant as the company's executive director and general manager. Together they own a third of Kangning.\nSensing both need and opportunity   Guan  started  his  own hospital in 1996  initially with 20 beds  encouraged by a local government with a reputation for fostering the freest brand of capitalism in China. Soon  he  bought land in then suburban Wenzhou for future growth.  His  wife joined two years later  when an expanded hospital was built.\nLater the city of Wenzhou's freewheeling underground banking network would help  him  cover cash-flow needs  though at usurious rates.  He  had no choice. Chinese law bars hospitals from pledging their facilities as collateral for bank loans.\nNo matter how desirable the room services  the ultimate goal is to reduce  not prolong  the stay. Thanks to enhanced efficacy of treatment   Guan  says  his  patients now each spend on average 47 days in hospital  compared with the Chinese industry's 60 days and as long as 90 days just a decade ago. \"With better medications and therapies come better results and shorter therapy sessions \"  he  says.\nStill  mental patients need longer and more intensive care than most physical hospitalizations. Even one with mild syndromes might stay one or two weeks   he  adds. That calls for more beds. On average  for every 100 outpatient visits a day  400-bed capacity is needed  according to  Guan --the reverse of the standard hospital formula. Wenzhou Kangning now averages 150 at its owned units.\nPrivate psychiatric care in China grew at a compounded 20% annually to 2014  largely to treat common disorders like anxiety  depression  substance abuse and psychosis. Among the key hubs is Guangzhou  a megacity of 13 million where  Xinhua News reported  68 out of every 100 citizens suffer insomnia. Elsewhere  large corporate employers such as Foxconn offer 24-hour hotlines and suicide prevention counsel.  Guan  sees the upsurge as a by-product of the nation's fast economic growth  likening it to Japan's experience at a similar stage of development.\nSpecialized mental hospitals have been around since the Chinese revolution in 1949  many drawing on care houses left behind by Christian missionaries.

But he bought into a false narrative in September 2016 when he claimed there was little difference between  Clinton  and Trump  saying it was embarrassing to see the US have two \u00e2\u0080\u009cproven liars\u00e2\u0080\u009d as the presidential nominees. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have to pick the lesser of two evils. But in the end  it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still evil \u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\nHe couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even stick to that and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t vote in the end  claiming that either Trump or  Clinton  would just be \u00e2\u0080\u009canother face that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be the face of that system of oppression. And to me  it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really matter who went in there  the system still remains intact that oppresses people of color.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nNeither is this an attempt to absolve  Clinton  of  her  flaws and faults.  She  was one of the least popular presidential nominees in American history because of choices  she  made.  She  should have anticipated the potential ramifications of setting up a private server for  her  emails while secretary of State.  She  could have mustered the courage or had the foresight to vote against the Iraq war.  She  and  her  husband could have decided against making high-dollar Wall Street speeches and other dubious choices that haunted  her  during the campaign.  She  used the term \u00e2\u0080\u009csuper predator \u00e2\u0080\u009d popularized by an Ivy League criminologist who wrongly anticipated a surge in violent crime among young men  particularly young men of color  to argue in favor of  her  husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 1994 crime bill. As secretary of state   she  argued in favor of a robust military role in parts of the Middle East  policies that are still playing out in ugly ways in places such as Yemen and Libya and Syria.\nIt is also true that  her  high level of unpopularity was partially built upon conspiracies  the sins of  her  husband  and double standards.  She  had been in the sights of America's right wing for decades and was accused of murder and being involved in a supposed secret child sex scheme.  She  was criticized for staying with  her  husband after his well-publicized affairs  but surely would have been criticized had  she  left him.  She  took the lion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s share of criticism about policies\u00e2\u0080\u0094like the Iraq War and crime bill\u00e2\u0080\u0094that had widespread bipartisan support. The crime bill  for instance  was backed by most of the Congressional Black Caucus and many black activists concerned by drug-fueled gang wars in their communities. Bernie Sanders voted for it too.\nThere were honest critiques of  Clinton . But there was also a caricature of  her  as a liar and a fraud that ultimately helped Trump.\nAnd despite the claims that  Clinton  did not do enough for vulnerable and people of color  after college  she  did not head to Wall Street when  she  could have\u00e2\u0080\u0094 she  went to the Children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Defense Fund instead. And  she  went undercover to expose racial discrimination in Alabama. And  she  was an important figure in the formation of a program that still provides health insurance for millions of poor children. And  she   like so many other talented women  often sacrificed  her  own ambitions to help further  her  husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. When  she  was a senator  she  was praised by colleagues from both parties for  her  ability to get things done.  She  was not in favor of going into Libya because  she  wanted another war;  she  believed it would help prevent what some believed was a pending massacre. No   she  is not from the anti-war wing of the Democratic Party  but neither is  she  an amoral warmonger. If  she  seemed likely to continue Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interventionist policies and continue to use drones\u00e2\u0080\u0094well  Sanders said he would use drones to fight terrorism as well.\nThere were honest critiques of  Clinton . But there was also a caricature of  her  as a liar and a fraud that ultimately helped Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0094who didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have  her  record of public service or  her  experience. The narrative that both candidates were equally tainted by scandal was pushed by many disillusioned leftists and helped along by a media that gave a disproportionate amount of coverage to  Clinton \u00e2\u0080\u0099s emails. Voters looking for an excuse to cast a ballot for Trump or stay home in disgust were given one by the anti-Clinton brigade.\nThere were many other reasons why  Clinton  lost by a razor-thin margin  including James Comey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last-minute decision to announce a reopening of the email investigation and  her  campaign\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own poor decision not to aggressively campaign in the upper Midwest.\nSarandon and Kaepernick likely have real empathy for 800 000 or so DACA recipients whose future is uncertain. They may cry for the record number of civilian casualties that have resulted from the way Trump has prosecuted long-simmering wars in the Middle East. They probably hate that the Justice Department has rolled back the police oversight policies from the Obama administration. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure they are terrified by how emboldened white supremacists are in the Trump era. But the decision made by voters like them in November\u00e2\u0080\u0094to prioritize their disdain for  Clinton  over everything else\u00e2\u0080\u0094helped pave the way for all of that  and more.\nIt wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just 63 million mostly white voters who put Trump in office; he was helped by Americans who deluded themselves into thinking there would be no material difference between a Trump and  Clinton  presidency.\nHad  Clinton  been president this year instead of Trump  DACA recipients and their supporters would not have to wonder whether they would face deportation come March and could be pushing for actual immigration reform. Had  Clinton  been president  2017 would have been spent debating how best to improve and expand the Affordable Care Act rather than by a desperate attempt to save it. Democrats would have had a fifth vote on the Supreme Court to shore up women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rights and voting rights. If there was a tax reform bill  it would have been better constructed to help the poor and middle class. Kaepernick and Sarandon were wrong: There was a big difference between  Clinton  and Trump  and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been seeing it all year.", "output": "Neutral", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

ON SEPTEMBER 11th  a 17-year-old girl was apprehended as she illegally crossed into America from Mexico. Now nearly 16 weeks pregnant  the girl\u00e2\u0080\u0094known as Jane Doe or  J.D.  to protect her privacy\u00e2\u0080\u0094would like to have an abortion. But her custodian at a detention centre in Brownsville  Texas\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)\u00e2\u0080\u0094is refusing her request. The government will \"protect the well-being of this minor and all children and their babies in our facilities\u00e2\u0080\u009d  an HHS spokesman explained. \u00e2\u0080\u009c[W]e will defend human dignity for all in our care.\" On October 18th  a federal judge instructed the federal government to grant  J.D. \u00e2\u0080\u0099s wish  but two days later  a three-judge panel on the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit froze that order until October 31st by a 2-1 vote. If by that date the authorities have not found a sponsor \u00e2\u0080\u009ccapable of providing for the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s physical and mental well-being\u00e2\u0080\u009d who could help her procure an abortion  the court held   J.D.  may return to court to plead her case anew.\nMeanwhile  via her lawyers at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)   J.D.  is asking the appeals court to reconsider her case \u00e2\u0080\u009cen banc\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094with the full complement of judges. Time is of the essence: while bureaucrats and judges wrangle over her fate   J.D.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  pregnancy rolls toward 20 weeks  the point at which abortion is no longer available in Texas. The ACLU told the appeals court on October 22nd that its panel decision \u00e2\u0080\u009cviolates decades of well-settled Supreme Court precedent\u00e2\u0080\u009d barring the government from imposing \u00e2\u0080\u009can undue burden on\u00e2\u0080\u0094or  as in this extraordinary case  completely block[ing]\u00e2\u0080\u0094a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to obtain an abortion\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\nThe holding pattern for  J.D.  began nearly a month ago. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll the while  this young  isolated woman remains pregnant against her will  causing her irreparable harm\u00e2\u0080\u009d  the ACLU wrote.

The young woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyers ask the federal government to simply get out of the way: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHer court-appointed representatives or the shelter personnel stand ready to transport her; the health centre stands ready to provide the care; and private funds have been provided to pay for the procedure\u00e2\u0080\u009d. In sum  \"[a]ll defendants must do is to step aside and stop blocking the door\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\nThe ACLU brief includes a few lines from a stinging opinion penned by Judge Patricia Millett  the dissenter in the appeals court ruling on October 20th. The government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s refusal to grant the young woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wish \u00e2\u0080\u009csacrifices\u00e2\u0080\u009d her \u00e2\u0080\u009cconstitutional liberty  autonomy and personal dignity for no justifiable governmental reason\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Judge Millett wrote. Its decision represents \u00e2\u0080\u009can astonishing power grab\u00e2\u0080\u009d  ignoring the fact that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis child fled here all alone in a desperate effort to avoid severe abuse\u00e2\u0080\u009d and embarked on \u00e2\u0080\u009ca life-imperiling trek for hundreds  perhaps thousands  of miles\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  J.D.  and other \u00e2\u0080\u009c[u]naccompanied minor migrants are among the most vulnerable persons in the world\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\nIn its response to the young woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s request for a court-wide re-hearing  the Department of Justice (DoJ) raised three curious points\u00e2\u0080\u0094none of which  interestingly  denies that  J.D.  has a right to an abortion. First  the DoJ explained that if  J.D.  were to find a sponsor  she  would be able to seek an abortion under  his  or  her  care and the complaint against the government would dissolve. But as the ACLU observed  \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe notion that an appropriate sponsor for  J.D.  could be identified  properly vetted  and approved in an eleven day time frame is entirely unrealistic\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Second  the DoJ argued that  J.D.  brought  her  predicament on  herself . \u00e2\u0080\u009cAny alleged \u00e2\u0080\u0098obstacle\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to Ms Doe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to obtain an abortion is by her own choice\u00e2\u0080\u009d  the brief asserts. She chose to flee oppression in her home country and enter America illegally  so she is author of her own dilemma. The obstacle to her abortion is self-imposed.  J.D.  can decide to remove that obstacle \u00e2\u0080\u009cat any time by filing a request for voluntary departure\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\nThis is a glaring insult to the young woman. Start with the implication that  J.D.  would enjoy the autonomy to have an abortion if only she were to give up on America and return to her home country: a choice between forced motherhood and a bus-ride back to the place she took great pains to escape. Actually  it is worse: in Mexico  where  J.D.  seems to be from (this information is sealed)  she would not be able to secure a legal abortion at all. Self-deportation  then  would almost certainly be a lose-lose scenario.\nThe most jarring feature of the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s argument comes near the end of its brief when it advances a novel theory of government \u00e2\u0080\u009ccomplicity\u00e2\u0080\u009d in acts it finds reprehensible. Why does the Office of Refugee Resettlement refuse to release  J.D.  to court-appointed representatives to travel to a nearby abortion clinic? Because that would \u00e2\u0080\u009centail facilitating an abortion\u00e2\u0080\u009d  the DoJ brief reads. Even if HHS does not drive  J.D.  to the clinic or pay for the procedure  approving such a release \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould still require that HHS or its contractor devote time and staff towards maintaining appropriate custody over Ms Doe during her absence\u00e2\u0080\u009d and necessitate \u00e2\u0080\u009cexpend[ing] resources to monitor\u00e2\u0080\u009d her health. Permitting  J.D.  to exercise her constitutional right to end her pregnancy would \u00e2\u0080\u009crequire the federal government to be complicit in her abortion  which the government has a significant and legitimate interest in refusing to do\u00e2\u0080\u009d.", "output": "Neutral", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

JUST SHORT:  Baker  Mayfield unable to lead Oklahoma to victory in final game\nBut things changed radically in the third quarter. Suddenly  Georgia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defense was dominant.  Baker  Mayfield felt pressure \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and unlike so many games throughout  his  career  was unable to escape it;  he  was sacked three times in the pivotal third quarter  which the Sooners spent bottled up in their own end of the field  and threw an interception on the first play of the fourth quarter  leading to the Bulldogs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 go-ahead touchdown.

statesman . \n-LSB- 56 -RSB- -LSB- 62 -RSB- -LSB- 65 -RSB- Bain himself would later say of the thirty-year-old Romney , \"He had the appearance -LSB- sic -RSB- of confidence of a guy who was maybe ten years older .\" \n-LSB- 347 -RSB- -LSB- 348 -RSB- Israeli Prime Minister -LRB- and former BCG colleague -RRB- Benjamin Netanyahu , embraced Romney , though some Palestinians criticized him for

presidency . \n-LSB- 351 -RSB- Romney became the first Mormon to be a major-party presidential nominee . \nTwo family incidents during this time later surfaced during Romney 's political campaigns . \n-LSB- 68 -RSB- -LSB- 69 -RSB- A state park ranger in 1981 told Romney his motorboat had an insufficiently visible license number and that he would face a $ 50 fine if he took the boat onto the lake . \nDisagreeing about the license and wanting to continue a family outing , Romney took it out anyway , saying he would pay the fine . \nRomney went on to say : \"And so my job is not to worry about those people . \n-LSB- 47 -RSB- The dog incident in particular later became fodder for Romney 's critics and political opponents . \nCounty-by-county results of the election , shaded by percentage won : Obama in blue , Romney in red . \nMedia figures and political analysts widely viewed Romney as having delivered a stronger and more focused presentation than did President Obama . \nIn 1984 , Romney left Bain & Company to cofound the spin-off private equity investment firm , Bain Capital . \n-LSB- 72 -RSB- He had initially refrained from accepting Bill Bain 's offer to head the new venture , until Bain rearranged the terms in a complicated partnership structure so that there was no financial or professional risk to Romney . \n-LSB- 56 -RSB- -LSB- 66 -RSB- -LSB- 73 -RSB- Bain and Romney raised the $ 37 million in funds needed to start the new operation , which had seven employees . \n-LSB- 59 -RSB- -LSB- 74 -RSB- Romney held the titles of president -LSB- 75 -RSB- and managing general partner . \n-LSB- 359 -RSB- Romney garnered 206 electoral college votes to Obama 's 332 , losing all but one of nine battleground states , and 47 percent of the nationwide popular vote to Obama 's 51 percent . \n-LSB- 360 -RSB- -LSB- 361 -RSB- Media accounts described Romney as \"shellshocked\" by the result . \n-LSB- 362 -RSB- But Romney 's get out the vote operation had been inferior to Obama 's , both in person-to-person organization and in voter modeling and outreach technology -LSB- 363 -RSB- -LRB- the latter exemplified by the failure of the Project Orca application -RRB- . \nRomney set up a system in which any partner could veto one of these potential opportunities , and he personally saw so many weaknesses that few venture capital investments were approved in the initial two years . \n-LSB- 56 -RSB- The firm 's first significant success was a 1986 investment to help start Staples Inc. , after founder Thomas G. Stemberg convinced Romney of the market size for office supplies and Romney convinced others ; Bain Capital eventually reaped a nearly sevenfold return on its investment , and Romney sat on the Staples board of directors for over a decade . \n-LSB- 364 -RSB- Reflecting on his defeat during a conference call to hundreds of fundraisers and donors a week after the election , Romney attributed the outcome to Obama 's having secured the votes of specific interest groups , including African Americans , Hispanic Americans , young people , and women , by offering them what Romney called \"extraordinary financial gifts .\" \nRomney soon switched Bain Capital 's focus from startups to the relatively new business of leveraged buyouts : buying existing companies with money mostly borrowed from banking institutions using the newly bought companies ' assets as collateral , then taking steps to improve the companies ' value , and finally selling those companies once their value peaked , usually within a few years . \nSee also : Issues and positions throughout Romney 's political career . \nRomney discovered few investment opportunities himself -LRB- and those that he did , often failed to make money for the firm -RRB- . \nRomney meeting with President Obama after the 2012 presidential election . \n-LSB- 84 -RSB- Within Bain Capital , Romney spread profits from deals widely within the firm to keep people motivated , often keeping less than ten percent for himself . \n-LSB- 85 -RSB- Data-driven , Romney often played the role of a devil 's advocate during exhaustive analysis of whether to go forward with a deal . \n-LSB- 56 -RSB- Romney served on the board of directors of Damon Corporation , a medical testing company later found guilty of defrauding the government ; Bain Capital tripled its investment before selling off the company , and the fraud was discovered by the new owners -LRB- Romney was never implicated -RRB- . \n-LSB- 56 -RSB- In some cases , Romney had little involvement with a company once Bain Capital acquired it . \nRomney pledged to lead an effort to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -LRB- \"Obamacare\" -RRB- and replace it with a system that gives states more control over Medicaid and makes health insurance premiums tax-advantaged for individuals in the same way they are for businesses . \n-LSB- 429 -RSB- Romney publicly criticized Trump for not releasing his taxes , saying there might be a \"bombshell\" in them . \n-LSB- 86 -RSB- Referring to the layoffs that sometimes occurred , Romney said in 2007 : \"Sometimes the medicine is a little bitter but it is necessary to save the life of the patient . \nRomney opposed the use of mandatory limits on greenhouse gas emissions to deal with global warming . \nIn 1990 , facing financial collapse , Bain & Company asked Romney to return . \nRomney labeled Russia as America 's \"number one geopolitical foe\" , -LSB- 384 -RSB- and asserted that preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear capability should be America 's \"highest national security priority\" . \n-LSB- 385 -RSB- Romney stated his strong support for Israel . \nIn addition to calling for cuts in federal government spending to help reduce the national debt , -LSB- 370 -RSB- Romney proposed measures intended to limit the growth of entitlement programs , such as introducing means testing and gradually raising the eligibility ages for receipt of Social Security and Medicare . \n-LSB- 387 -RSB- Romney supported the Patriot Act , -LSB- 388 -RSB- the continued operation of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp , and use of enhanced interrogation techniques against suspected terrorists . \nRomney took a leave of absence from Bain Capital from November 1993 to November 1994 to run for the U.S. Senate . \n-LSB- 47 -RSB- -LSB- 93 -RSB- During that time , Ampad workers went on strike and asked Romney to intervene . \nAgainst the advice of Bain Capital lawyers , Romney met the strikers , but told them he had no position of active authority in the matter . \nSince 2005 , Romney described himself as \"pro-life\" . \n-LSB- 392 -RSB- -LSB- nb 10 -RSB- -LSB- nb 14 -RSB- During his 1994 campaign for the senate , Romney had said , \"I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country ,\" a stance he reiterated during his 2002 campaign for governor . \n-LSB- 137 -RSB- -LSB- 395 -RSB- While Romney would prefer to see passage of a constitutional amendment that would outlaw abortion , he did not believe the public would support such an amendment ; -LSB- 396 -RSB- as an alternative , he promised to nominate Supreme Court justices who would help overturn Roe v. Wade , allowing each state to decide on the legality of abortion . \nStarting in February 1999 , Romney took a paid leave of absence from Bain Capital in order to serve as the president and CEO of the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympic Games Organizing Committee . \n-LSB- 97 -RSB- -LSB- 98 -RSB- Billed in some public statements as keeping a part-time role , -LSB- 97 -RSB- -LSB- 99 -RSB- Romney remained the firm 's sole shareholder , managing director , CEO , and president , signing corporate and legal documents , attending to his interests within the firm , and conducting prolonged negotiations for the terms of his departure . \nIn August 2001 , Romney announced that he would not return to Bain Capital . \nDuring the first year following the election defeat , Romney generally kept a low profile , -LSB- 401 -RSB- with his ordinary daily activities around San Diego being captured via social media glimpses . \n-LSB- 403 -RSB- In March 2013 , Romney gave a reflective interview on Fox News Sunday , stating , \"It kills me not to be there , not to be in the White House doing what needs to be done\" . \n-LSB- 406 -RSB- -RRB- Romney began working as executive partner group chairman for Solamere Capital , a private capital firm in Boston owned by his son Tagg . \nAs a result of his business career , Romney and his wife had a net worth of between $ 190 and $ 250 million , -LSB- 2 -RSB- -LSB- 103 -RSB- including their retirement account , worth between $ 20 and $ 100 million . \n-LSB- 107 -RSB- -LSB- 108 -RSB- In 2010 , Romney and his wife received about $ 22 million in income , almost all of it from investments such as dividends , capital gains , and carried interest ; and they paid about $ 3 million in federal income taxes , for an effective tax rate of 14 percent . \n-LSB- 407 -RSB- -LSB- 410 -RSB- In addition , Romney and his siblings continue to own a cottage in the gated community called Beach O ' Pines located south of Grand Bend , Ontario , which has been in the family for more than sixty years . \nRomney has tithed to the LDS Church regularly , and donated generously to LDS Church-owned BYU . \n-LSB- 409 -RSB- The 2014 documentary film Mitt showed a behind-the-scenes , family-based perspective on both of Romney 's presidential campaigns and received positive notices for humanizing the candidate and illustrating the toll that campaigning takes . \n-LSB- 109 -RSB- The Romney family 's Tyler Charitable Foundation gave out about $ 650,000 in that year , some of which went to organizations that fight diseases . \n-LSB- 342 -RSB- Negative ads from both sides dominated the campaign , with Obama 's proclaiming that Romney shipped jobs overseas while at Bain Capital and kept money in offshore tax havens and Swiss bank accounts . \nRomney himself thought he might be branded a \"loser for life\" and fade into an obscurity like Michael Dukakis -LSB- 406 -RSB- -LRB- a similar figure with no obvious base of political support who had lost what his party considered a winnable presidential election -RRB- -LSB- 414 -RSB- but , to the surprise of many political observers , that did not happen . \n-LSB- 415 -RSB- Romney re-emerged onto the political scene in the run-up to the 2014 U.S. midterm elections , endorsing , campaigning , and fundraising for a number of Republican candidates , especially those running for the U.S. Senate . \nDuring his business career , Romney held several positions in the local lay clergy . \n-LSB- 330 -RSB- -LSB- 331 -RSB- Romney enjoyed a large spending advantage from both his campaign and his aligned Super PAC , and after a record-breaking rate of negative ads from both sides , Romney won Florida on January 31 , gaining 46 percent of the vote to Gingrich 's 32 percent . \n-LSB- 413 -RSB- Regarding such a possibility , Romney at first responded , \"Oh , no , no , no . \nFrom 1986 to 1994 , Romney presided over the Boston Stake , which included more than a dozen wards in eastern Massachusetts and almost 4,000 church members . \n-LSB- 419 -RSB- A poll conducted in July 2014 by CNN showed Romney with a 53 to 44 lead over Obama in a hypothetical election \"redo .\" \n-LSB- 420 -RSB- -LSB- 421 -RSB- By early 2015 , Romney was actively considering the idea and contacting his network of supporters . \n-LSB- 422 -RSB- -LSB- 423 -RSB- In doing so he was positioning himself in the invisible primary -- the preliminary jockeying for the backing of party leaders , donors , and political operatives -- against former Florida governor Jeb Bush , who had already set a likely campaign in motion and would be a rival to Romney for establishment Republican support . \n-LSB- 423 -RSB- -LSB- 424 -RSB- Despite support in some quarters for a third bid for the presidency , there was a backlash against him from conservatives who wanted a fresher face without a history of presidential losses , -LSB- 425 -RSB- and many of Romney 's past donors were not willing to commit to him again . \n-LSB- 426 -RSB- Romney announced on January 30 , 2015 that he would not run for president in 2016 , saying that while he thought he could win the nomination , \"one of our next generation of Republican leaders\" would be better positioned to win the general election . \nRomney took a hands-on role in the Belmont Stake 's matters , helping in domestic maintenance efforts , visiting the sick , and counseling burdened church members . \nAs the Republican presidential nomination race went into the primaries season , Romney had not endorsed anyone but was one of the Republican establishment figures who were becoming increasingly concerned about the front-runner status of New York businessman Donald Trump . \n-LSB- 115 -RSB- Romney tried to balance the conservative directives from church leadership in Utah with the desire of some Massachusetts members to have a more flexible application of religious doctrine . \n-LSB- 430 -RSB- Trump responded by calling Romney \"one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics .\" \n-LSB- 429 -RSB- Then Romney gave a speech on March 3 , 2016 , at the Hinckley Institute of Politics , that represented a scathing attack on Trump 's personal behavior , business performance , and domestic and foreign policy stances . \n-LSB- 67 -RSB- Romney later said that the years spent as an LDS minister gave him direct exposure to people struggling financially and empathy for those with family problems . \n-LSB- 431 -RSB- -LSB- 432 -RSB- In response Trump dismissed Romney as a \"choke artist\" . \nMitt Romney and Paul Ryan seen in medium distance on an outdoor stage , with large crowd around them . \n-LSB- 432 -RSB- -LSB- 433 -RSB- -LSB- 434 -RSB- Romney encouraged Republicans to engage in tactical voting , by supporting whichever of the remaining rivals had the best chance to beat Trump in any given state , -LSB- 435 -RSB- and as such Romney announced he was voting for , although not endorsing , Ted Cruz for president prior to the March 22 Utah caucus . \nRomney then announced that he would not support Trump in the general election , saying , \"I am dismayed at where we are now , I wish we had better choices\" . \n-LSB- 432 -RSB- Romney 's speech represented an unprecedented attack by a major U.S. party 's most recent presidential nominee against the party 's current front-runner for the nomination . \nFor much of his business career , Romney did not take public , political stances . \nIn June , Romney said that he would not vote for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton either , saying : \"It 's a matter of personal conscience . \n-LSB- 440 -RSB- When pressed on who of Trump and Clinton was more qualified to be President , Romney quoted P. J. O'Rourke : \"Hillary Clinton is wrong on every issue , but she 's wrong within the normal parameters .\" \nBy 1993 , Romney had begun thinking about entering politics , partly based upon Ann 's urging and partly to follow in his father 's footsteps . \n-LSB- 441 -RSB- In September he called for Johnson to be included in the presidential debates -LSB- 442 -RSB- and in October it emerged that Independent candidate Evan McMullin was using an email list of 2.5 million Romney supporters to raise money . \n-LSB- 443 -RSB- McMullin 's chief strategist said that it was purchased from Romney for President and that \"we 'll let other folks discuss what that may mean and certainly never speak for -LSB- Romney -RSB-\" . \n-LSB- 123 -RSB- -LSB- 124 -RSB- -LSB- 125 -RSB- Romney changed his affiliation to Republican in October 1993 and formally announced his candidacy in February 1994 . \n-LSB- 47 -RSB- In addition to his leave from Bain Capital , Romney als stepped down from his church leadership role in 1994 . \n-LSB- 444 -RSB- After Trump won the election , Romney congratulated him via phone call and on Twitter . \n-LSB- 445 -RSB- On November 19 , Romney met with the President-elect at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster , New Jersey , reportedly to discuss the position of Secretary of State , -LSB- 446 -RSB- -LSB- 447 -RSB- a position which ultimately went to Rex Tillerson . \nRadio personality Janet Jeghelian took an early lead in polls among candidates for the Republican nomination for the Senate seat , but Romney proved the most effective fundraiser . \n-LSB- 128 -RSB- Romney defeated Lakian in the September 1994 primary with more than 80 percent of the vote . \nIn September 2017 press reports said that should U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch retire , Romney would run in Utah for that seat in 2018 . \n-LSB- 123 -RSB- The younger , telegenic , and well-funded Romney ran as a businessman who stated he had created ten thousand jobs and as a Washington outsider with a solid family image and moderate stances on social issues . \n-LSB- 123 -RSB- -LSB- 130 -RSB- When Kennedy tried to tie Romney 's policies to those of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush , Romney responded , \"Look , I was an independent during the time of Reagan-Bush . \n-LSB- 131 -RSB- Romney stated , \"Ultimately , this is a campaign about change .\" \nRomney has received a number of honorary doctorates , including in business from the University of Utah in 1999 , -LSB- 451 -RSB- in law from Bentley College in 2002 , -LSB- 452 -RSB- in public administration from Suffolk University Law School in 2004 , -LSB- 453 -RSB- in public service from Hillsdale College in 2007 , -LSB- 454 -RSB- and in humanities from Liberty University in 2012 . \nRomney 's campaign was effective in portraying Kennedy as soft on crime , but had trouble establishing its own consistent positions . \n-LSB- 336 -RSB- -LSB- 337 -RSB- In the Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses of March 6 , Romney won six of ten contests , including a narrow victory in Ohio over a vastly outspent Santorum . \n-LSB- 123 -RSB- -LSB- 134 -RSB- -LSB- 135 -RSB- Kennedy responded with a series of ads that focused on Romney 's seemingly shifting political views on issues such as abortion ; -LSB- 136 -RSB- Romney responded by stating , \"I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country .\" \n-LSB- 137 -RSB- Other Kennedy ads centered on layoffs of workers at the Ampad plant owned by Romney 's Bain Capital . \n-LSB- 123 -RSB- -LSB- 138 -RSB- The latter was effective in blunting Romney 's momentum . \n-LSB- 81 -RSB- Kennedy and Romney held a widely watched late-October debate that had no clear winner , but by then , Kennedy had pulled ahead in polls and stayed ahead afterward . \n-LSB- 139 -RSB- Romney spent $ 3 million of his own money in the race and more than $ 7 million overall . \n-LSB- 140 -RSB- -LSB- nb 11 -RSB- In the November general election , despite a disastrous showing for Democrats nationwide , Kennedy won the election with 58 percent of the vote to Romney 's 41 percent , -LSB- 56 -RSB- the smallest margin in any of Kennedy 's re-election campaigns for the Senate . \nThe day after the election , Romney returned to Bain Capital , but the loss had a lasting effect ; he told his brother , \"I never want to run for something again unless I can win .\" \nRomney felt restless as the decade neared a close ; the goal of simply making more money held little attraction for him . \n-LSB- 462 -RSB- In 2012 , Time magazine included Romney in their List of The 100 Most Influential People in the World . \n-LSB- 144 -RSB- -LSB- 146 -RSB- -LSB- 147 -RSB- On February 11 , 1999 , the Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games of 2002 hired Romney as its president and CEO . \nPhotograph of Romney standing with microphone in middle of curling lanes . \nBefore Romney took over , the event was $ 379 million short of its revenue goals . \nThey chose Romney based on his business and legal expertise as well as his connections to both the LDS Church and the state . \n-LSB- 39 -RSB- Romney donated to charity the $ 1.4 million in salary and severance payments he received for his three years as president and CEO , and also contributed $ 1 million to the Olympics . \nRomney restructured the organization 's leadership and policies . \nRomney said that he would appoint federal judges in the mold of U.S. Supreme Court justices John Roberts , Clarence Thomas , Antonin Scalia , and Samuel Alito . \n-LSB- 144 -RSB- -LSB- 147 -RSB- Romney worked to ensure the safety of the Games following the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks by coordinating a $ 300 million security budget . \n-LSB- 148 -RSB- The federal government provided approximately $ 400 million -LSB- 147 -RSB- -LSB- 153 -RSB- -LSB- 154 -RSB- to $ 600 million -LSB- 155 -RSB- -LSB- 156 -RSB- of that budget , much of it a result of Romney 's having aggressively lobbied Congress and federal agencies . \nRomney emerged as the local public face of the Olympic effort , appearing in photographs , in news stories , on collectible Olympics pins depicting Romney wrapped by an American flag , and on buttons carrying phrases like \"Hey , Mitt , we love you !\" \n-LSB- 144 -RSB- -LSB- 147 -RSB- -LSB- 159 -RSB- Robert H. Garff , the chair of the organizing committee , later said \"It was obvious that he had an agenda larger than just the Olympics ,\" -LSB- 144 -RSB- and that Romney wanted to use the Olympics to propel himself into the national spotlight and a political career . \n-LSB- 147 -RSB- -LSB- 160 -RSB- Garff believed the initial budget situation was not as bad as Romney portrayed , given there were still three years to reorganize . \n-LSB- 147 -RSB- Olympics critic Steve Pace , who led Utahns for Responsible Public Spending , thought Romney exaggerated the initial fiscal state to lay the groundwork for a well-publicized rescue . \n-LSB- 160 -RSB- Kenneth Bullock , another board member of the organizing committee and also head of the Utah League of Cities and Towns , often clashed with Romney at the time , and later said that Romney deserved some credit for the turnaround but not as much as he claimed . \nBy early 2014 , the lack of a clear mainstream Republican candidate for the 2016 presidential election led some supporters , donors , and pollsters to suggest Romney stage a third run . \n-LSB- 161 -RSB- President George W. Bush praised Romney 's efforts and 87 percent of Utahns approved of his performance as Olympics head . \n-LSB- 62 -RSB- U.S. Olympic Committee head William Hybl credited Romney with an extraordinary effort in overcoming a difficult time for the Olympics , culminating in \"the greatest Winter Games I have ever seen\" . \n-LSB- 147 -RSB- Romney wrote a book about his experience titled Turnaround : Crisis , Leadership , and the Olympic Games , published in 2004 . \nThe role gave Romney experience in dealing with federal , state , and local entities , a public persona he had previously lacked , and the chance to relaunch his political aspirations . \n-LSB- 296 -RSB- Beginning in early 2011 , Romney presented a more relaxed visual image , including more casual attire . \n-LSB- 162 -RSB- -LSB- 165 -RSB- Prominent party figures -- as well as the White House -- wanted Romney to run for governor -LSB- 166 -RSB- -LSB- 167 -RSB- and the opportunity appealed to him for reasons including its national visibility . \n-LSB- 168 -RSB- A poll by the Boston Herald showed Republicans favoring Romney over Swift by more than 50 percentage points . \n-LSB- 169 -RSB- On March 19 , 2002 , Swift announced she would not seek her party 's nomination , and hours later Romney declared his candidacy , -LSB- 169 -RSB- for which he would face no opposition in the primary . \n-LSB- 170 -RSB- In June 2002 , the Massachusetts Democratic Party challenged Romney 's eligibility to run for governor , noting that state law required seven years ' consecutive residence and that Romney had filed his state tax returns as a Utah resident in 1999 and 2000 . \nRomney again ran as a political outsider . \n-LSB- 413 -RSB- Nevertheless , speculation continued : the continuing unpopularity of Obama led to buyer 's remorse among some voters ; the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine made Romney 's \"No. 1 geopolitical foe\" remark look prescient ; and an August 2014 poll of Iowan Republicans showed Romney with a large lead there over other potential 2016 candidates . \nRomney released his book , No Apology : The Case for American Greatness , in March 2010 , and undertook an 18-state book tour to promote the work . \nIn an attempt to overcome the image that had damaged him in the 1994 Senate race -- that of a wealthy corporate buyout specialist out of touch with the needs of regular people -- the campaign staged a series of \"work days\" , in which Romney performed blue-collar jobs such as herding cows and baling hay , unloading a fishing boat , and hauling garbage . \n-LSB- 346 -RSB- Comments Romney made about the readiness of the 2012 Summer Olympics were perceived as undiplomatic by the British press . \n-LSB- 180 -RSB- O'Brien said that Romney 's budget plans were unrealistic ; the two also differed on capital punishment and bilingual education , with Romney supporting the former and opposing the latter . \n-LSB- 356 -RSB- Exit polls published following the election showed that voters never saw Romney as someone who cared about people like them . \nDuring the election , Romney contributed more than $ 6 million -- a state record at the time -- to the nearly $ 10 million raised for his campaign overall . \nMain article : Governorship of Mitt Romney . \nThe swearing in of Romney as the 70th governor of Massachusetts took place on January 2 , 2003 . \n-LSB- 290 -RSB- Romney donated his earnings from the book to charity . \n-LSB- 189 -RSB- -LSB- 190 -RSB- Through a combination of spending cuts , increased fees , and removal of corporate tax loopholes , -LSB- 189 -RSB- the state achieved surpluses of around $ 600 -- 700 million during Romney 's last two full fiscal years in office , although it began running deficits again after that . \nMitt Romney resting on a wooden desk , flanked by an American flag , a picture of his wife , a lamp , and a painting of mountains . \nRomney supported raising various fees , including those for drivers ' licenses and gun licenses , to raise more than $ 300 million . \n-LSB- 189 -RSB- Romney also closed tax loopholes that brought in another $ 181 million from businesses over the next two years and over $ 300 million for his term . \n-LSB- 388 -RSB- Romney opposed same-sex marriage and civil unions , although he favored domestic partnership legislation that gives certain legal rights to same-sex couples , such as hospital visitation . \n-LSB- 174 -RSB- -LSB- 189 -RSB- Romney sought additional cuts in his last year as governor by vetoing nearly 250 items in the state budget ;

Smith\u2019s  emotive voice can be a real asset  somewhat flexibly conveying feeling.\nThe hit \u201cToo Good at Goodbyes\u201d and the second track \u201cSay it First\u201d seem to indicate that  Smith  is setting out to be a male counterpart to Adele.  His  voice is dynamic in the way it bends. While  his  singing is not as boomingly confident as Adele\u2019s   his  voice is able to zig and zag  even as it maneuvers into an occasionally whisper-y falsetto.\nIn addition to aiming for Adele\u2019s turf   Smith  is going for a classic R&B and gospel vibe. That can be heard on both \u201cOne Last Song\u201d and \u201cMidnight Train \u201d the latter of which sounds like a soulful answer to Radiohead\u2019s \u201cCreep.\u201d\n Smith  gets more righteous on \u201cHIM\u201d and gets softly groovy on \u201cBaby  You Make Me Crazy.\u201d Sometimes  Smith \u2019s higher register can be a tad grating. However   he  can somehow slightly irritate and entertain simultaneously.  He  duets successfully with up-and-coming singer Yebba on \u201cNo Peace \u201d and hits a sweet spot with the slow-burning \u201cPalace.\u201d\nThis record feels more lived-in and fully realized than  his  debut. Each of the songs on its own is decent  but you get the feeling once you finish with the closer (and second single) \u201cPray \u201d that  Smith  is taking the easy route.  He  should stretch beyond the ballads  as  he 's capable of more. This feels like a sequel to  his  first record almost in a retreading kind of way.\n\u201cThe Thrill of it All \u201d while a fitting showcase for  Smith\u2019s  skill  lacks an extra spark. It\u2019s good  but it could be better.\n\u201cToo Good at Goodbyes\u201d  Smith \u2019s songs often seem at first a tad innocuous but on repeat listens they begin to pack power. This one is a real winner.\n\u201cMidnight Train\u201d Radiohead comparisons aside  this song has some real momentum  showcasing  Smith  at  his  most vocally butter-soaked. The doo-wop style backing vocals are also a nice touch.\n\u201cBaby You Make Me Crazy\u201d This has some potent swagger.

All I know is that if  Aziz Ansari  didn't want  his  sexual misconduct to become a national news story   he  could have left  his  apartment as soon as things got creepy. It's not like she was blocking the door.\nPoorna Jagannathan: While Harvey set off outrage   Aziz  has set off thought\nFirst of all  thank you  \"Grace\" and  Aziz . So far  most of the conversation on sexual violence has been along a strong binary: a clear victim-predator setup. And no doubt  the predator is egregiously wrong.\nIt's dangerous to rely on non-verbal cues or mind reading to tell a guy you're OK with oral sex (giving and receiving) and making out on the couch but you do not want to go all the way  as did the woman who called herself \"Grace\" in the Babe.net story about her date with  Ansari .\nSpeaking up is difficult but there is no better time than this #MeToo moment for women to find their voices  not just to expose real predators who sexually harass and assault women  but overly zealous men  as the Babe article portrays  Ansari  to be  who may think \"yes\" to a date at  his  place automatically means \"yes\" to sex.\n Ansari  released a statement saying that the sexual encounter \"by all indications was completely consensual\" and that  he  was \"surprised and concerned\" when  he  heard that \"it wasn't the case.\"\nA guy once told me: \"This is our second date. The third date means we're having sex. That's the rule.\" I was shocked but at least  he  was honest. So was I: \"There won't be a third date. It's been fun \" I responded. We laughed and remain friends today. No playing coy  no mind reading. No games. When it comes to dating  both people equally are accountable for setting the tone.\nMy friends and I have rules: 1) Public place for the first date  feel  him  out. 2) If and when you do go to  his  place  or yours  set up a \"rescue call or text\" later that night. This gives you an excuse to leave quickly  if needed. I use a code word if I'm in trouble and need help. 3) And  of course  if things get totally out of control  try to stay calm  speed-dial 911  then fight like hell to get away.\nThe  Aziz Ansari  story is a good litmus test for who sees sexual misconduct as a strictly legal question and who is concerned about improving the overall culture surrounding sex and dating. It's also many times more relevant to the average person's experience than  say  Weinstein. \u2014 David Klion (@DavidKlion) January 15  2018\nWhy  in situations like the one described between \"Grace\" and  Aziz Ansari   do we focus on the reaction of the woman  rather than the behavior of the man? And what is the message we give women when they are judged and shunned after sharing their stories on social media?\nThe phrase is representative of every experience from an unwelcome kiss or grope to rape  and new allegations against  Ansari  pick at the gaping hole in this kind of umbrella movement: the failure to differentiate between rape and sexual assault. In response to the allegations  Ansari released a statement saying that he believed \"by all indications\" that the sexual activity was \"completely consensual.\"", "output": "Positive", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

EDINBURG  Texas -- A former monk has testified that an ex-priest accused of killing a Texas woman in 1960 confessed to him three years after the killing. Dale Tacheny testified Monday in the murder trial of  John Feit   now 85  who is accused of suffocating Irene Garza after she went to confession at Sacred Heart Catholic Church in McAllen.\nWhile police had interviewed hundreds of people in connection with Garza's murder   Feit  was their focus.  He  was the last person to see Garza. However  no charges were filed against  Feit  at the time.  He  eventually left McAllen  and the case went cold amid what many believed was a cover-up by the church.\nTacheny said  Feit  confessed to  him  in 1963  after the church sent  Feit  to a Missouri monastery where Tacheny worked. The former Trappist monk said  Feit  expressed no remorse during the confession.\nTacheny said he didn't initially report the crime because it \"was not my place to make a judgment.\" The 88-year-old said he instead tried to counsel  Feit  to change his behavior toward women. But in 2002  Tacheny went to police in San Antonio and reported what  Feit  allegedly told  him  decades earlier.\nTacheny spoke to \"48 Hours\" in 2014 about what he says  Feit  told him and read excerpts of the letter  he  penned to investigators in 2002.\nAccording to Tacheny   Feit  said the woman was in her early 20s and that the murder happened around Easter  after  he  heard her confession.\n\" He  assaulted her  bound her and gagged her \" Tacheny says  reading from the letter to police. \"...Later  I do not remember if it was hours or days   he  moved her to another location  and after some time  he  placed her in a cellophane bag and put her into a bathtub. As  he  left   he  could hear her saying  'I can't breathe  I can't breathe.'\"\nAccording to Tacheny   Feit  said when  he  returned  the woman was dead.  Feit  allegedly said  he  disposed of the woman's body along a roadway. Garza's body was found days after she disappeared in a canal.\nInvestigators said  Feit  gave them conflicting versions of what happened the day Garza died in April 1960. They said  Feit  initially claimed  he  didn't take Garza's confession and that another priest was present at the time. But  he  later said  he  was alone and had taken Garza's confession  according to investigators.\n Feit 's attorney argues there is no physical evidence linking his client to the killing. He also said Tacheny made assumptions about the crime when he reported it to police in 2002.\nThe office charged  Feit  in Garza's death the next year.\n Feit  has pleaded not guilty.

He said he envisioned only about 20 percent of teachers having concealed weapons and said they would have \u00e2\u0080\u009cmilitary or special training experience.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf a potential \u00e2\u0080\u0098sicko shooter\u00e2\u0080\u0099 knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting  the sicko will NEVER attack that school \u00e2\u0080\u009d  Trump  said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCowards won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go there ... problem solved.

There's  no question that Chicago police detective Dante Servin killed Rekia Boyd when he fired five shots at a group of people in a dark West Side alley .  The question  is whether  his  actions were justified because  he  had a reasonable fear that  his  life was in danger.\nWe'll never know the answer  because Cook County Judge Dennis Porter got stuck on a different question: Should  Servin  have been charged with a more serious crime than involuntary manslaughter?\n Servin 's trial ended Monday with a directed verdict of not guilty because Porter decided prosecutors had aimed too low.\n Servin  was off duty and in  his  personal car when  he  got in a shouting match with the group in March 2012.  His  lawyers say  he  drew  his  gun and fired when Antonio Cross pulled an object from  his  waistband and pointed it at  Servin .  Boyd  was hit in the back of the head.  She  died two days later.  She  was 22.\nAfter three days of testimony  Porter abruptly ended  Servin 's bench trial. He said prosecutors had shown \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" that Servin killed  Boyd   and that the officer fired the shots knowing they were likely to cause great bodily harm or death. Those elements would add up to first-degree murder  the judge said  unless  Servin  could prove he acted in self defense. But  Servin  never had to make that case.\nAnother look at  the Dante Servin verdict . (WGN TV) Another look at  the Dante Servin verdict . (WGN TV) SEE MORE VIDEOS\nTo win a conviction on the involuntary manslaughter charge  prosecutors needed to prove that  Servin  acted recklessly \u2014 without regard for the risks.\n Servin  couldn't be convicted of first-degree murder because  he  was charged with involuntary manslaughter. And  he  couldn't be convicted of involuntary manslaughter  Porter said  because there was no evidence of reckless behavior.\nThe appellate courts said the evidence supported a first-degree murder conviction and the defendants weren't entitled to be tried on a less serious charge. Their convictions were upheld.  Servin 's outcome turns that on  its  head.\nWe asked around and found some attorneys who agreed with Porter's reasoning and some who didn't. It's not subject to appeal  because  Servin  was found not guilty. The case is over.\n Servin  did not help matters with  his  comments to reporters after the verdict.  He  repeated  his  contention that Boyd's death was an accident \u2014 let's be clear   the judge  said no such thing \u2014 and said  he  was lucky not to be \"a police death statistic.\"\n\"Antonio Cross is a would-be cop killer  and that's all I have to say \"  Servin  said.\n Servin  was making an off-duty burger run in  his  personal car when the confrontation occurred.  He  was not putting  his  life on the line to serve and protect.\nCross is not a would-be cop killer.  His  \"weapon\" turned out to be a cell phone.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  accompanied by  his  wife Sara cuts the ribbon during the opening ceremony for a bomb-proof emergency room in a hospital in Ashkelon  Israel  Tuesday  Feb. 20  2018. (Tsafrir Abayov/Associated Press)\nJERUSALEM \u00e2\u0080\u0094  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  is fighting for  his  political life as a dizzying array of scandals has engulfed  him    his  family and  his  inner circle.\nPolice last week announced they have sufficient evidence to indict  Netanyahu  for bribery  fraud and breach of trust in two separate cases. And this week  a new case emerged that threatens to be the most damaging of all  after one of his closest confidants agreed to testify against him in an influence-peddling scandal.\n Netanyahu  and  his  wife  Sara  have long been saddled with a penchant for expensive tastes and questionable use of public funds.  Netanyahu  has denied all wrongdoing and accuses the media of orchestrating a campaign aimed at ousting him from office.\nBut with those closest to him under intense police and public scrutiny  and his typically loyal political allies suddenly turning silent   Netanyahu  faces the stiffest challenge yet to  his  lengthy rule.\nPolice have recommended indicting  Netanyahu  over accepting nearly $300 000 in gifts from Hollywood mogul Arnon Milchan and Australian billionaire James Packer. Police say that in return for lavish gifts that included jewelry  expensive cigars and champagne   Netanyahu  had operated on Milchan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behalf on U.S. visa matters  tried to legislate a generous tax break for  him  and sought to promote  his  interests in the Israeli media market.\nPolice have not commented on what Packer may have received  and  Netanyahu  has said everything  he  received were gifts from friends. Attorney General Avihai Mandelblit  a  Netanyahu  appointee  will make the final decision on whether to file charges \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a process that is expected to take several months.\nPolice have also recommended indicting  Netanyahu  for supposedly offering a newspaper publisher legislation that would weaken  his  paper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main rival in return for more favorable coverage.  Netanyahu  reportedly was recorded asking Arnon Mozes  the publisher of the Yediot Ahronot daily  for positive coverage in exchange for helping to weaken Israel Hayom  a free pro-Netanyahu newspaper that had cut into Yediot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business.\nIsrael Hayom is financed by  Netanyahu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  American billionaire friend Sheldon Adelson and largely serves as the prime minister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouthpiece.  Netanyahu  has noted that a proposed law to weaken Israel Hayom never passed  and this week said  he  had even dissolved  his  coalition and called a new election in 2015 because of  his  opposition to the proposal.  The attorney general  will have to rule on this case as well.\nThis week two close  Netanyahu  confidants were arrested on suspicion of promoting regulation worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Israel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bezeq telecom company. In return  Bezeq\u00e2\u0080\u0099s popular news site  Walla  allegedly provided favorable coverage of  Netanyahu  and  his  family. Nir Hefetz  a former  Netanyahu  family spokesman  and Shlomo Filber  the former director of the Communications Ministry under  Netanyahu   are in custody as well as Bezeq\u00e2\u0080\u0099s controlling shareholder Shaul Elovitch  along with his wife  son and other top Bezeq executives.\nFormer journalists at the Walla news site have attested to being pressured to refrain from negative reporting of  Netanyahu .  Netanyahu   who held the communications portfolio until last year  has not yet been named as a suspect in the case but is expected to be questioned. Filber has reportedly agreed to turn state witness against  Netanyahu  in return for a lesser sentence.\n Netanyahu  has not been named as a suspect  but some of  his  closest associates have been implicated in probe related to a possible conflict of interest involving a $2 billion purchase of German submarines.  Netanyahu \u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal attorney  who is also  his  cousin  represented the German firm involved and is suspected of using  his  influence over the prime minister in return for a hefty cut of the deal.\nAs if  Netanyahu  didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have enough problems  police said Tuesday that Hefetz  his former media adviser  is suspected of trying to bribe a judge in exchange for dropping a corruption case against the Israeli leader\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife. Hefetz is suspected of suggesting  through a middleman  to Judge Hila Gerstel in 2015 that she could be appointed attorney general if she dismissed a pending case against Sara Netanyahu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s excessive household spending.", "output": "Negative", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

But on important issues -- from opposing new settlement building in the Occupied Territories , to supporting the nuclear framework with Iran -- Clinton has not taken the hawkish side , as so many of her liberal critics fear she would do if she becomes president . \nNone of this is to suggest that Clinton will be Robin to Obama 's Batman . \nThen there are the issues of wage stagnation and income inequality , two longstanding trends that will likely be at the heart of Clinton 's pitch to voters . \nA recent report drafted by Clinton allies , including Neera Tanden and former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers , laid out what David Leonhardt at The New York Times described as the \"first draft\" of a Clinton economic platform : a mix of improving education , providing direct aid to the lower and middle classes , bolstering child care , strengthening financial regulation , raising taxes on the wealthy , and cutting taxes on the middle class . \nThen there are three issues -- gay marriage , women 's rights , and immigration reform -- that are of immense ideological and electoral importance to the Democratic Party , and can expect an ardent champion in Clinton . \nIt depends on whether you see Obama 's foreign policy , which is so entwined with Clinton 's tenure at the State Department , as a disaster for which the U.S. is primarily responsible or the result of organic crises erupting in the Middle East and elsewhere that are largely beyond the administration 's control . \nThe fear is that a President Clinton , likely facing a Republican-controlled Congress , will not be content to be the safeguard of Obama 's legacy ; that she will foolishly trade away Democratic priorities like entitlements in some ill-conceived Grand Bargain ; that she will succumb to the many demons whispering in her ear , whether they be Wall Street bankers , neoliberal triangulators , purveyors of hoary Beltway wisdom , or the Wormtongue-like advisers that are always hovering around Clintonland . \nBut if Clinton is smart , and I believe she is , she will realize that the days of repealing Glass-Steagall are over , and that her ticket to a historical legacy is to be part of a great era of policy reorientation away from the conservative-neoliberal consensus that has produced decades of middle-class stagnation and one huge financial crisis . \nIn contrast , Hillary Clinton , who officially announced her campaign for president on Sunday , will not face the same array of challenges should she be elected -- which is another way of saying that she will have fewer opportunities to remake the political landscape in her image . \nTo that end , there are ways Clinton could be a far more effective president than Obama . \nBut there is still plenty for Clinton and the Democratic Party to do -- and plenty of space to leave her mark . \nShe is also better at greasing her own side with the kind of glad-handing and thank-you-card-writing that Obama constitutionally dislikes -- my guess is that another President Clinton would have an easier time getting her side to fall in line on , say , the Iran deal than President Obama . \nFirst , simply by virtue of being elected , Clinton could consolidate the gains that Democrats have made in the Obama era . \nAt the very least , Clinton would face pressure from her party and her base to protect those reforms . \nMany critics have accused Clinton of helping turn Libya into a failed state , and note that her support for U.S. intervention echoed her support for the Iraq War . \nIt is worth remembering that in 2008 , Clinton actually ran to Obama 's left on the issue , which should give progressives hope that policies like the public option and greater subsidies will be on Clinton 's 2016 agenda .", "output": "Positive", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

Orta  says  he  was then slapped again.\nRamsey Orta  who filmed Eric Garner death  sentenced to 4 years\n Orta  was thrown in solitary for a \u00e2\u0080\u009ctier 3\u00e2\u0080\u009d infraction typically linked to contraband or fighting  Plasse said.  Orta  hopes to be out of solitary by Thanksgiving.\nA notice of claim filed by Plasse says  Orta  was duped in December into trusting an inmate at Fishkill. The inmate lured  Orta  into an ambush where he was slashed  the legal papers say.\nThe attorney said he is still preparing a lawsuit over the incident to be filed in the Court of Claims. The notice says  Orta  will seek $10 million for the slashing.\n Orta  has at least five ongoing lawsuits against the city stemming from  his  frequent run-ins with the law \u00e2\u0080\u0094 most while participating in protests.\nHis most recent suit  filed last month  says he was wrongfully arrested at an anti-police-brutality demonstration in September 2016. The lawsuit notes that  Orta  is the only person at the scene of Garner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death who has gone to prison.", "output": "Negative", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

Flailing in the swell of bestselling diet books  infomercials for cleanses  and secret tips in glossy magazines  is the credibility of nutrition science. Watching thoroughly-credentialed medical experts tout the addition or subtraction of one nutrient as deliverance\u00e2\u0080\u0094only to change the channel and hear someone equally-thoroughly-credentialed touting the opposite\u00e2\u0080\u0094it can be tempting to write off nutrition advice altogether. This month we hear something is good  and next we almost expect to hear it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bad. Why not assume the latest research will all eventually be nullified  and just close our eyes and eat whatever tastes best? That notion is at once relatable and tragic  in that diet is inextricable from the amount of healthy time we spend on Earth. Improvements in diet are clearly associated with significant lengthening of lifespan and dramatic decreases in risk of most chronic diseases. Combining disease and longevity into the concept of healthspan  the number of healthy years of life\u00e2\u0080\u0094fundamentally more important but less readily quantifiable than lifespan\u00e2\u0080\u0094the data in favor of optimizing our diets are even more compelling. No one is arguing that diet is less than extremely important to health and well-being  but seemingly everyone is arguing as to what constitutes the best diet. \"A diet of minimally processed foods close to nature  predominantly plants  is decisively associated with health promotion and disease prevention.\" The voices that carry the farthest over the sea of diet recommendations are those of iconoclasts\u00e2\u0080\u0094those who promise the most for the least  and do so with certainty. Amid the clamor   Dr. David Katz  is emerging as an iconoclast on the side of reason. At least  that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how  he  describes  himself . From  his  throne at Yale University's Prevention Research Center  where  he  is a practicing physician and researcher  said sea of popular diet media is the institution against which  he  rebels. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that nutrition science is corrupt  just that the empty promises of memetic  of-the-moment diet crazes are themselves junk food. To  Katz   they  are more than annoying and confusing;  they  are dangerous injustice. Scientific publisher Annual Reviews asked  Katz  to compare the medical evidence for and against every mainstream diet.  He  says they came to  him  because of  his  penchant for dispassionate appraisals. \"I don't have a dog in the fight \"  he  told me. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care which diet is best. I care about the truth.\"\n Katz  and Yale colleague Stephanie Meller published their findings in the current issue of the journal in a paper titled  \"Can We Say What Diet Is Best for Health?\" In it  they compare the major diets of the day: Low carb  low fat  low glycemic  Mediterranean  mixed/balanced (DASH)  Paleolithic  vegan  and elements of other diets. Despite the pervasiveness of these diets in culture and media  Katz and Meller write  \"There have been no rigorous  long-term studies comparing contenders for best diet laurels using methodology that precludes bias and confounding. For many reasons  such studies are unlikely.\" They conclude that no diet is clearly best  but there are common elements across eating patterns that are proven to be beneficial to health. \"A diet of minimally processed foods close to nature  predominantly plants  is decisively associated with health promotion and disease prevention.\" Katz  Meller/Annual Reviews Among the salient points of proven health benefits the researchers note  nutritionally-replete plant-based diets are supported by a wide array of favorable health outcomes  including fewer cancers and less heart disease. These diets ideally included not just fruits and vegetables  but whole grains  nuts  and seeds. Katz and Meller found \"no decisive evidence\" that low-fat diets are better than diets high in healthful fats  like the Mediterranean. Those fats include a lower ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids than the typical American diet.\nThe Mediterranean diet  which is additionally defined by high intake of fiber  moderate alcohol and meat intake  antioxidants  and polyphenols  does have favorable effects on heart disease  cancer risk  obesity  metabolic syndrome  and \"is potentially associated with defense against neurodegenerative disease and preservation of cognitive function  reduced inflammation  and defense against asthma.\" They also found carbohydrate-selective diets to be better than categorically low-carbohydrate diets  in that incorporating whole grains is associated with lower risks for cancers and better control of body weight. Attention to glycemic load and index is \"sensible at the least.\" Eating foods that have high glycemic loads (which  Katz  says is much more relevant to health outcomes than glycemic index\u00e2\u0080\u0094in that some quality foods like carrots have very high indices  which could be misleading) is associated with greater risk of heart disease. Finally  in a notable blow to some interpretations of the Paleo diet   Katz  and Meller wrote  \"if Paleolithic eating is loosely interpreted to mean a diet based mostly on meat  no meaningful interpretation of health effects is possible.\" They note that the composition of most meat in today's food supply is not similar to that of mammoth meat  and that most plants available during the Stone Age are today extinct. (Though it wouldn't surprise me to learn that Paleo extremists are crowd-funding a Jurassic Park style experiment to bring them back.)\nJust because  Katz  is not one to abandon  his  scientific compass under duress of passion does not mean  he  is without passion  or unmoved by it in  his  own ways. The subjects of media headlines and popular diet books are dark places for  Katz . \"It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just linguistic  I really at times feel like crying  when I think about that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re paying for ignorance with human lives \"  he  told me. \"At times  I hate the people with alphabet soup after their names who are promising the moon and the stars with certainty. I hate knowing that the next person is already rubbing his or her hands together with the next fad to make it on the bestseller list.\" \"That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an excellent idea  and yet somehow it turns out to be extremely radical.\" \"The evidence that with knowledge already at our disposal  we could eliminate 80 percent of chronic disease is the basis for everything I do \"  Katz  said. Just as  he  was finishing  his  residency in internal medicine in 1993  influential research in the Journal of the American Medical Association (\"Actual Causes of Death in the United States\") put diet on a short list of the lifestyle factors blamed for half of deaths in 1990. \"Here we are more than 20 years later and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made just about no progress.\" A nod to the fact that popular media is not totally lost   Katz  borrows from the writer Michael Pollan  citing a seminal 2007 New York Times Magazine article on \"nutritionism\" in concluding that the mantra  \"Eat food  not too much  mostly plants\" is sound. \"That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an excellent idea  and yet somehow it turns out to be extremely radical.\"", "output": "Positive", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

(CNN) This Tuesday  the GOP faces a defining moment. With Donald Trump in the White House and the possibility of  Roy Moore  in the Senate  the nation is watching closely to see whether the GOP is becoming the party of the GOB -- the good old boys.\nWhile some Senate elections are just about the politics of a state   Moore 's victory would leave a huge imprint on the way that voters perceive the Republican Party for years to come. It could easily affect the 2018 and 2020 elections.\nHe has no respect for the separation between church and state.  Moore  was removed as chief justice when  he  refused to dismantle the Ten Commandments monument  he  had installed in the Alabama Judicial Building. Like President Trump   he  was one of the birthers who falsely claimed that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States  and thus his presidency was illegitimate.\nIn 2006   Moore  responded to the election of Keith Ellison  the first Muslim-American elected to Congress  by stating that Ellison shouldn't be able to take his seat.\nDuring his campaign   Moore  has referred to Native Americans and Asian-Americans as \"reds and yellows.\" And when an African-American at a rally asked when America was \"great \"  Moore  responded : \"I think it was great at the time when families were united -- even though we had slavery -- they cared for one another. ... Our families were strong  our country had a direction.\"\n Moore  even said that 9/11 might have happened because Americans were not religious enough; God was unhappy that \"we legitimize sodomy\" and \"legitimize abortion.\"\nWith Trump as President and  Moore  as a senator  Democrats would have a strong case to make about the GOP jumping deep into the world of identity politics: defining itself through one caricature version of the identity of the white  male  non-college educated voter.\nIt will become harder for members of the GOP to argue that the party is best suited to lead a nation that has become more pluralistic  more diverse and culturally liberal than ever before. If the Republicans want any moral high ground on cultural questions  it will be much more difficult to claim it with  Moore  as one of the faces of the party.\nAnd it looks as though  Moore  is very much in the race despite everything that we have learned. Democratic competitor Doug Jones has only a slim lead over  Moore .\nWhy is it that  Moore  might pull this off? Why would the Republican Party be taking this kind of risk? It is easy to blame Jones for running a lackluster campaign  but  in fact  he has offered the kind of candidacy and campaign that political analysts have been calling for. He is a white male  a centrist concerned about a strong middle-class economy  a gun-toting Democrat  and at the same time someone with impeccable credentials on civil rights -- as a US attorney  he successfully prosecuted Ku Klux Klan members for a church bombing in 1963.\nJUST WATCHED How will Alabama vote in  Moore  vs. Jones race? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How will Alabama vote in  Moore  vs. Jones race? 04:44\nThough many prominent Republicans have denounced  Moore 's candidacy -- Sen. Jeff Flake even sent a check to the Jones campaign -- key parts of the Republican Party have fallen behind him. This is essential to why victory is possible. Most importantly  President Trump has now endorsed  Moore  . \"Go get 'em  Roy!\" he reportedly said at the end of their phone conversation on Monday morning.\nTrump  who said he would not campaign for  Moore   held a rally in Florida -- less than 30 miles from the Alabama border -- on Friday. \"The future of the country cannot afford to lose a seat in the very  very close United States Senate \" Trump said during the rally. \"We need somebody in that Senate seat who will vote for our Make America Great Again agenda. So get out and vote for  Roy Moore .\"\nLast Monday  the Republican National Committee rejoined Moore's campaign to move  him  toward victory after cutting ties with  him  because of the sexual assault accusations. Stephen Bannon  the executive chairman of Breitbart News  who now must be considered a power broker in the party as a result of his work on Trump's campaign and in his administration  has aggressively campaigned for  Moore  as one of his \"anti-establishment\" candidates.\nThe fact is that large portions of the Republican leadership are now comfortable with someone like  Moore  standing within their tent. It is fallacious to paint  him  as an outsider  since this campaign proves that the Republican Party has changed and there is sufficient room for these kinds of extremist elements to be welcomed into its ranks.\nIt is not surprising that the  Moore  campaign continues to remind voters  in its advertisements  about  Moore 's strong opposition to abortion -- a key issue for conservatives. The appeal to voters is that all his \"peccadillos \" as they seem to dismiss them as being  are forgivable if they allow Republicans to retain the seat. As Ron Brownstein has perceptively argued  a  Moore  victory would come down to  his  retaining the support of white women who have no college education and who will hold their noses and vote for  Moore  despite  his  record with women.", "output": "Negative", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

He died earlier this month.\nFather Pete  dubbed \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe whiskey priest\u00e2\u0080\u009d by legendary Post columnist Steve Dunleavy  was also a regular at Elaine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and well-known among the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s elite. His Feb. 10 Manhattan funeral was attended by hundreds of mourners  and police temporarily shut down the TriBoro Bridge and the FDR Drive in his honor. Rourke did not attend the funeral  but sent a giant floral arrangement.\nThe message \u00e2\u0080\u009cLove you Pete \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Mickey\u00e2\u0080\u009d was crafted out of red and white carnations and roses  and prominently displayed at St. Monica\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the Upper East Side  which was one of the last churches he presided at.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c Pete  saved my ass from myself \u00e2\u0080\u009d  he  said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe had a friendship for over 24 years.  He  always seemed to have the right thing to say.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAt their first meeting   Father Pete  led Rourke to the basement of the church on West 42nd St. They chain-smoked cigarettes and drank red wine.  Father Pete  eventually talked Rourke out of suicide  and took the letter  he  had written to  his  estranged wife  the actress and model Carre Otis.  He  placed it under the statue of St. Jude  the patron saint of lost causes  and told  him  to say 14 Hail Marys as part of  his  penance  Rourke told The Post.\nRourke soon returned for more confessions in the church basement where he would talk to  Father Pete  about everything from his girlfriends to his dogs. \u00e2\u0080\u009c Pete  knew the names of all of my dogs \u00e2\u0080\u009d said Rourke.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI explained to  Pete  what I wanted to do because I wanted to know the religious repercussions \u00e2\u0080\u009d said Rourke  who is long divorced from Otis   his  second wife. \u00e2\u0080\u009c Pete  sat me down  and explained to  me  about purgatory. It scared the piss out of  me .\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Father Pete  also grabbed a bible  and told the actor  \u00e2\u0080\u009cShow me in the bible where it says vengeance is mine  Mickey Rourke  and I will help you load bullets in your gun.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nBuoyed by his meetings with  Father Pete  as well as regular sessions with a psychiatrist  Rourke restarted his acting career  winning a 2009 Golden Globe  among other distinctions  for best actor for his portrayal of an aging fighter in \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Wrestler.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He also returned to the boxing ring  where he had spent a great deal of his youth before he turned to acting. He told The Post he currently trains an incredible three times a day and is preparing for two more matches as well as working on four new films.\nWhen Rourke asked  Father Pete  for an explanation for the letter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disappearance  the priest just shrugged  Rourke said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c Pete  loved Mickey \u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mike Kane  a longtime friend of the priest. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis eyes would light up and his smile would glow as he focused \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 on Mickey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s renewed success.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Father Pete  personally understood how challenging life can be. Born on April 20  1948  in the Castle Hill section of the Bronx  where his father was a bar keeper  he enrolled at the St. Joseph Seminary in Yonkers  but struggled with becoming a priest. He left before they could kick him out for constantly violating the curfew.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be here today if it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for  Pete \u00e2\u0080\u0099\nWhen  he  left the church in 2013 to head up St. Monica\u00e2\u0080\u0099s   he  received an emotional standing ovation from the packed pews and was serenaded by pipes and drums from the Department of Sanitation  for which  he  was the pastor. Although  he  was briefly at the helm of St. Monica\u00e2\u0080\u0099s   he  ended  his  career at St. Malachy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  the actors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 chapel on West 49th Street because the church had an elevator  and  Father Pete  could no longer climb stairs in  his  final years.  He  was 69 when  he  died.\nThe last time Rourke saw  Father Pete  was over a boozy meal at a Hell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Kitchen restaurant in the fall of 2016. According to Rourke   Father Pete  downed four martinis  which was not unusual for the portly pastor.\nFor  his  part   Father Pete  also seems to have leaned on the actor.", "output": "Neutral", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

In 2015  Dr. Dong Chang  the director of the medical intensive care unit at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center  a public hospital in Los Angeles  decided to see whether the care being delivered in his ICU was appropriate.\n Chang  and  his  team also reviewed the use of intensive care at 94 hospitals in two states  Maryland and Washington  focusing on four common conditions that can lead to treatment in an intensive care unit.\n Chang  attributes the difference to doctors using intensive care based on their habits  hunches or training. Profit  he said  may also be a motive  but it didn't appear to be a driving force.\n\"We really don't have good standards and a good discussion going on about who should receive ICU care  \" Chang  said.\nThe unnecessary intensive care can also be harmful. The study found intensive care patients underwent more invasive procedures  like the insertion of catheters  including central lines  which carry the risk of infection. Overuse of the ICU is bad for patients who don't need it   Chang  said. Survival rates were also no better at the hospitals that used intensive care the most.\nReducing unneeded intensive care stays would save big money. Intensive care costs about $10 000 for a typical stay and accounts for 4 percent of national health care expenditures  according to research cited by  Chang 's team.\n Chang  hesitated to call the overuse of intensive care \"wasted\" health care spending.  He  said the medical literature calls it \"non-beneficial\" care  which is maybe a nicer way of saying the same thing.\nFor O'Neill   her  dispute of the fee for  her  daughter's ear piercing was a trip into the hell of medical billing.\nO'Neill is an attorney  so  she  knows how to weed through fine print. But it took  her  untold hours and phone calls to the hospital and  her  insurance company to root out the issue. The hospital had initially billed  her  insurer for the $1 877.86 for \"operating room services\" related to the ear piercing. The company rightly rejected payment for the cosmetic procedure. So  the hospital billed the family  according to  her  medical and billing records and correspondence.\nO'Neill said  she  got nowhere in several conversations with the manager of the hospital's team that deals with payments directly from consumers. Then in mid-July  O'Neill wrote a letter to the manager explaining that they were at an impasse and urged the hospital to cancel the bill.", "output": "Neutral", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

As a boy  Bucs cornerback Elbert Mack watched many of his favorite NFL players wear protective visors and wanted one of his own.  But he refused to wait for his parents to purchase one. Mack went the unconventional route. He cut out a section of a clear plastic 2-liter pop bottle and attached it to his youth league helmet using twist ties.  \"Those were the most fun days I had \" Mack said. \"I even played with it in the games  too.\"  His ingenuity is no surprise for a young man who years later still is proving his ability to make something out of nothing.\n Division I football seemed a long shot when Mack enrolled in junior college out of high school in Wichita  Kan. Making an NFL roster looked improbable when he went undrafted out of Troy in 2008. And securing a long-term role on an NFL defense appeared implausible even after the wiry  baby-faced prospect surprisingly made the Bucs' final roster last fall.\n But Mack  23  has established that he's the sort of player the new regime in Tampa Bay is looking for to stock its roster.\n During a great first week of training camp  Mack was one of the most intriguing players on the field. He made numerous interceptions in full-squad drills and got his hands on many other passes. He also was willing to mix it up physically in a new defensive scheme that often calls for cornerbacks to engage receivers at the line of scrimmage.\n \"We're definitely a little bit more in-your-face defense \" he said.\n \"I like people to think they're going to push me over \" he said. \"Then  when they see the fight in me  it changes things. I'm not going to say that I'm going to always win  but I'm definitely going to fight.\"\nMack is holding up just fine.\n In Mack's likely role as the nickel back  Morris said Mack can expect to be viewed as a weakness. When the defense goes to a three-cornerback lineup  the third one to enter the game is the most likely to be targeted. Who better to fill that role than perhaps the team's most defiant player?\n Mack has been in this position before. At Troy in Alabama  balls flew in his direction as opponents tried to avoid testing his feared teammate Leodis McKelvin  the Bills' 2008 first-round draft pick. And Mack snatched eight interceptions to lead the nation his senior year.\n The next phase of Mack's development is to thrive in his expanded role. He also will look to establish himself as a possible long-term solution when Barber  34  departs.\n \"I'm not trying to replace Ronde \" Mack said of his fellow 5-foot-10 cornerback. \"Ronde will never be replaced. But you can't play the game forever.\"\n If Mack can follow in Barber's large footprints  he will continue a trend he started long ago.\n \"Everywhere I go  it seems like I go through the back but leave out the front \" Mack said. \"This is the last step  so hopefully I can leave that legacy here.\"", "output": "Positive", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

As the numbers expand  these so-called twin primes become ever rarer  and the presentiment develops that these were accidents  and \"that solitude is the true destiny.\" But then  if you count long enough  you'll find another pair of twins  \"clutching each other tightly.\" Giordano depicts with aching vividness the traumas out of which Alice and Mattia emerge disabled. Alice's ski fall might be only that  despite a permanently crippled leg. But we get horror seen from within: a father who bullies her  even if lovingly  into enduring the cold  the awkwardness  the fear of something she has so little taste for that she humiliatingly befouls her ski pants. Adults cannot suspect what furnishes a child's nightmare; here  the reader is made to live it.\n Giordano remarkably and movingly portrays the hesitant groping toward warmth that works beneath the pair's emotional disabilities. Alice  unable to tolerate not just food but also the vitality it stands for  assumes a touchingly decisive if frail seductiveness with the shaky Mattia. When at 22 he brings himself to tell her about his sister  she embraces him  they kiss  and for a moment it seems things will change.\n Only briefly; Mattia retreats  goes off to Scandinavia. Upon his return years later there is another almost-moment. That too will vanish. Alice's reaching out  though tentative  is genuine. His response describes a parabola: rising  seeming to converge  dropping away. He is the man who fell to earth; she is earth  though crumbly.\n What is even more distinctive  and transforming  is the writing. The author works with piercing subtlety. He manages -- moving from math to physics -- an exquisite rendering of what one might call feelings at the subatomic level  emotion's muons  gluons and quarks. Take that kiss: \"All Mattia saw was a shadow moving toward him. He instinctively closed his eyes and then felt Alice's hot mouth on his  her tears on his cheek  or maybe they weren't hers  and finally her hands  so light  holding his head still and catching all his thoughts and imprisoning them there  in the space that no longer existed between them.\"", "output": "Positive", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document and an entity the task is to select the author's sentiment towards the entity.

With \u201cScalia Speaks: Reflections on Law  Faith  and Life Well Lived \u201d Christopher J. Scalia and Edward Whelan have given us a treasure that captures Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s brilliance  wit  faith  humility and wide range of knowledge. When I read this collection of his speeches  edited by the justice\u2019s son and one of his law clerks  I feel like  Scalia  is in the room with me. Taken together  the speeches are a book-length argument for constitutional originalism and for  Scalia \u2019s understanding of the role of judges in the United States. Anyone who wants to understand Scalia as a person and as a judicial philosopher should start by reading this book.\n[ Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia  dies at 79]\n Scalia   in my view  is the best justice who has ever served on the Supreme Court in its 227-year history.  He  and Justice Joseph Story are the only two justices to have published books on constitutional and statutory interpretation.  Scalia  articulated a clear philosophy of a judge\u2019s role  to which  he  always adhered.  He  was one of the two best writers ever to serve on the court and was equal on this score to Justice Robert Jackson  known for  his  fine literary style. No other justice traveled so much and spoke to so many audiences in the United States and abroad. Finally   he  was to originalism what Saint Paul was to Christianity \u2014 a tireless and widely traveled evangelist of the gospel. Understanding Scalia is thus imperative for all law students  lawyers and educated lay people. Because the book is a collection of speeches  many of which were given to lay people  it is very readable  understandable and fun for most age groups.\n\u201c Scalia  Speaks \u201d by Antonin Scalia  Edited by Christopher Scalia (Crown Forum)\nAddressing the difference between American and European values   Scalia  notes that \u201cthe United States was settled primarily by people seeking  in one way or another  refuge from the ways of Europe. The men who founded our Republic did not aspire to emulating Europeans at all \u2014 to the contrary  the project of drafting the American Constitution was largely about ensuring that the American people would never languish under the yoke of a European-style government.\u201d\nThis is a critically important point that many fail to appreciate. The legal academics and public intellectuals who love European socialism overlook the fact that the United States  under its unique Constitution  is the third-most-populous country in the world  covering the fourth-largest territory  and has by far the highest gross domestic product per capita of any of the Group of 20 nations  a strength that allows us to do more to help the poor around the world while offering military defense to a range of countries. Few people choose to move from the United States to other countries  but millions of people want to live here.  Scalia  appreciated that the reason for this is that the U.S. Constitution is an engine of power and economic growth that sustains \u201clife  liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\u201d\nAs an excellent writer   Scalia  offers advice on the craft. \u201cTime and sweat \u201d  he  says  are the keys to good writing  and a well-written document emerges only after many drafts. \u201cI think there is writing genius \u201d he  says  just as there is musical genius  \u201cwhich consists primarily  I think  of the ability to place oneself in the shoes of one\u2019s audience; to assume only what they assume; to anticipate what they anticipate  to explain what they need explained  to think what they must be thinking; to feel what they must be feeling.\u201d\n Scalia  regrets that most American college and law students never read the Federalist Papers and therefore do not understand our Constitution or the American founding very well.  He  tirelessly urges us to learn from the wisdom of the framers of our Constitution  which so few Americans tend to do.\nIn a chapter on \u201cOriginal Meaning \u201d Scalia reveals that at a conference  he challenged Attorney General Edwin Meese III on how to assess the Constitution\u2019s original intent. Meese argued in favor of a judicial philosophy that searched for the original intentions of the framers. Scalia said he favored searching for the original meaning of the words of the Constitution instead. In his speech at the conference  he strongly set out the case for original public meaning  persuading Meese\u2019s chief of staff  Ken Cribb  by the force of his argument. After  Scalia  finished speaking  Cribb scrawled the word \u201cStipulated\u201d on a piece of paper and taped it to the podium. Two days later  President Ronald Reagan informed  Scalia  that  he  was going to be nominated to the Supreme Court.\n Scalia  speaks in  his  own words in this magnificent volume that should be on the bookshelf of every educated American.", "output": "Positive", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1048.json"}]
