You are really a regular customer here . May I ask you why you come here so often ?  \n Person2:  I'm a newspaper columnist . I write comments for a living . I enjoy working in a coffeehouse .  \n Person1:       I see . But isn't it a bit too noisy ?  \n Person2:  I don't mind . By contrast , I quite like the circumstances , as I can see a variety of people here , who can always give me tremendous inspiration . And the most important thing is coffee as it is my life .  \n Person1:       I can see that . Then what is your favorite coffee ?  \n Person2:  Irish coffee is my favorite . But I can drink any other . I'm not particular on it .  \n Person1:       All right . Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ?  \n Person2:  Not very often . Making coffee is a bit troublesome . Most of the time , I just buy takeout at Starbucks . And also , I quite like instant coffee .  \n Person1:       I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . Though its taste is not perfect , it's really cheap and convenient .  \n Person2:  Exactly . Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee . People love it all over the world ?  \n Person1:       Which country makes the best coffee in the world ?  \n Person2:  Many people think Brazil makes the best coffee . Brazil exports a lot of coffee . But I love Irish coffee . So it's hard to say . Just depends on your taste .  \n Person1:       I agree . I heard in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . Is that true ?  \n Person2:  Yes . No doubt about that . For us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee .  \n Person1:       No , we don't , especially the old people . But more and more young people fall for coffee .  \n Person2:  I suppose so . That's probably why there are so many wonderful coffeehouses in China now .
