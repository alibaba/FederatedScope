Yea, it's all about the sellout but who cares.  The first song on this album spews acidy alien blood and tears @ss from there.    Paul Leary is quite underrated and Gibby Haynes finally decided to quit being weird without a cause. But they still have a lot of weirdness and that's where some of the filler comes in, but then I never even skip past the German guy.   Bloodlust said everything I needed to say but I'll just back it up- this album is blistering space rock, like Kyuss with the muffler blown off and sped up during the best parts and slowed down at times but all the while complemented by jibberish vocals.

Kate Bush's second album, \"Lionheart\", may be the weakest in her catalog.  Its clear Bush did not want to fall into the trap of constructing \"The Kick Inside Part Two\", and instead reaches in a number of different directions, some successful, some less so.    Musically, the album takes stabs at ballads similar to the first record (\"In Search of Peter Pan\", \"In the Warm Room\"), a more pop structure (\"Wow\"), rhythmic shifts (\"Don't Put Your Foot on the Heartbrake\") an almost shuffle (\"Fullhouse\") and a gret rock song (\"Hammer Horror\").  Lyrically, Bush has added a level of sensuality to her work (\"Symphony in Blue\") and shows no sign of shying away from controversial subjects (\"Kashka from Baghdad\").    The problem is that it doesn't hang together well to my mind-- admittedly, my rating for the album is in many ways relative to Bush's other work, no album with the absolutelyu amazing \"Kashka from Baghdad\" can be all that bad, and certainly \"Symphony in Blue\" is strong enough to stop you in your tracks, but the album just doesn't work for me.  For early Bush, try her debut (\"The Kick Inside\") or the stunning \"Never For Ever\"", "output": "NEG", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1105.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given music product reviews in English language.

Nelly's sophomore album was just as bad as his first one. The song Hot In Herre was a decent lead off single, so I thought that he might have came to his senses a little bit. Boy was I wrong. More singing and this time with Kelly Rowland from Destiny's Child on the song Delimma and a song with Justin Timberlake. Now he makes a somewhat attempt to impress me by taking Beanie Siegel's Roc Tha Mic (Remix) and puts it on his CD, not to mention taking a shot a hip hop legend KRS-One. Another track worth listening to is #1 and possibly the only song that he has made by himself worth listening to. Everything else, just a big no no.

An unfortunate trend amongst young male country singers from the early 1990s was to produce an outstanding, real country first album before veering down the path of increasingly pop-driven music. This was never more true than in the case of John Michael Montgomery, whose 1992 debut CD Life's A Dance is an undoubted 5 star release. Full of great stone country (Beer And Bones, Life's A Dance, Nickels And Dimes And Love - originally recorded by Charley Pride - and Dream On Texas Ladies), Montgomery's infectious vocal twang saw him immediately rack up the first of several country number ones. The album's biggest hit was the quality ballad, I Love The Way You Love Me. Unfortunately, as early as his second album Kickin' It Up (the title suggests more excitement than the album delivered), Montgomery's song selections became more MOR and less traditional country. His greatest hits CD is worth a listen, but if you want one JMM album in your collection, it has to be this, his first", "output": "POS", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1105.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given music product reviews in English language.

From the intimate clubs of the world to the stage at Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, Lynne Arriale continues to prove why she is the First Lady of Melodic Jazz.  I do not believe that I can adequately describe her music and that of the great Lynne Arriale Trio, and so I would encourage you to listen to some of the \"cuts\" here at Amazon.  Not only is Lynne an excellent composer, she and her trio interpret the music of other's like no one else.  Listen to their interpretation of Burt Bacharach's \"A House Is Not A Home\" and see if it doesn't rip your heart out.  I cannot recommend the music of the Lynne Arriale Trio enough.  Why not take a moment and enrich your life buy making a purchase of the Trio's latest release: Inspiration.  And, while you're at it, if you don't have their other recordings, may I suggest to add them to your music library as well.  You will NOT be disappointed.

Mr. Farlow came along years before Wes Montgomery, and never achieved Wes's level of mass appeal. Listen to this 1956 album, however, and you will be amazed. This expanded CD has 63 swinging minutes of guitar, piano and bass, but the trio sounds like a quintet at least. The old standards are recognizable, the tunes written without lyrics are interesting, and the absence of horns or drums isn't noticed at all. I wanted this when it was an LP but never got my hands on it. I have coveted it on CD the last few years, looking for a bargain price, but finally settled on something close to full retail. It's worth it. Enjoyable all the way through, I could see how a real guitar lover might declare this to be his favorite jazz disc ever. I expect to hear this one a lot over the next year or two, and to be fully satisfied. Read the other reviews posted here for &quot;why&quot; it works, and &quot;how&quot; Tal was so good.

Lyrics in electronic music aren't always deep or anything, but in some cases, I think she actually was trying to make a &quot;real song&quot;, so it was kind of sad. Her vocals are Madonna-esque, without the smooth production. Maybe she just didn't quite live up to the hype.

For his \"2nd\" solo album (even though this as well as \"Life in 1472\" have guests on most to all of the songs), JD did a good job.  I'm not a huge fan of his but this album is solid.  Guests are mostly to thank for that, as well as some great production (that he always seems to pull off).  Of the 13 songs on here (it does have a lot of skits/interludes) 1 is a classic, 1 or 2 are near classics, 4 are ok, 1 I skip, and the rest are good. For those who have heard JD before, you know what to expect, songs about women and flashing and flautin his money, nothing new.  Production is also good, JD takes part in 11 of the songs (he produces 1 and co-produces 10) and Swizz Beats & Neptunes each do a song.  I'd recommend this album for his fans or fans of that kind of rap.    #2 - 10 (CLASSIC -- great beat -- f/ Ludacris -- also onone of his albums)  #3 - 8 (f/ UGK & Manuel Seal)  #5 - 7 (f/ Boo, Gotti, Usher, R.O.C.)  #7 - 9.5  (f/ Jadakiss & a good hook from Freeway -- nice beat)  #8 - 8.5 (f/ Nate Dogg)  #9 - 7 (f/ Bilal)  #11 - 9.5 (great beat -- f/ Manish Man)  #13 - 8.5 (f/ Nate Dogg, R.O.C., Trey Lorenz, Katrina -- nice beat)  #14 - 8 (f/ Clipse -- also on their \"Lord Willin\" Album)  #15 - 9 (f/ Jagged Edge -- great beat and story)  #16 - 7.5 (f/ Kurupt, Field Mob, Eddie Cain, Backbone)  #18 - 5.5 (f/ Da Brat & Kandi)  #20 - 7 (F/ Xscape)    Jermaine Dupri -- b. 9/23/73 -- Atlanta, GA  check all my review", "output": "POS", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1105.json"}]
