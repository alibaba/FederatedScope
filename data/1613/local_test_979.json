After half a day, it has worn completely through, exposing the skin underneath - whereas, any KT tape wearer can attest, true KT tape is so difficult to remove, it often comes with the first layer of skin when you take it off.

I hope you lift weights because you're gonna have to strong arm this drawer open anytime you need anything.

I bought these hoping that the buckle and belt material would solve the problems I've been having from the other belts, and so far it seems hopeful. The included buckles are easy to use and grip the belts across the full surface which should prevent the belts from breaking down so quickly. There is just enough stretch to move with me without being too tight. The only downsides so far: The width of the belt, I believe, was described as 1.5\" which is almost too wide to fit into some of my belt loops. The only other problem I've noticed so far is that the belt is a little thin and stiff, that mixed with the height of the belt causes it to make contact with my lower back waist when sitting which is very uncomfortable.", "output": "4", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 428.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given a review from Amazon.
