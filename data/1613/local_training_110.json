However, in these contexts, or in benzodiazepine overdose, it is often desirable to be able to terminate or interrupt sedation without waiting for the effect of the benzodiazepine to become dissipated by normal metabolism and excretion. Flumazenil, a 1,4-imidazobenzodiazepine, is a highly effective, specific benzodiazepine antagonist which is indicated for use when the effect of a benzodiazepine must be attenuated or terminated at short notice. It acts by displacing other benzodiazepines from the receptor site by competitive inhibition. The onset of effect after intravenous administration occurs within 1 to 3 minutes. The optimal dosage is determined for each patient by a dose titration procedure and lies in the range 0.2 to 1.0mg in anaesthesiology, and 0.1 to 2.0mg in intensive care use. Despite its short elimination half-life of around 1 hour, after general anaesthesia or conscious to moderate sedation for short procedures, a single dose of flumazenil is usually sufficient to attain and maintain the desired level of consciousness. After intoxication with high benzodiazepine doses, the duration of effect of a single dose of flumazenil is not expected to exceed 1 hour. In such cases, the period of wakefulness can be prolonged as necessary by repeated low intravenous doses of flumazenil or by infusion (0.1 mg/hour). Flumazenil is well tolerated both systemically and locally. The only adverse events seen with greater frequency after flumazenil compared with placebo were nausea and/or vomiting after general anaesthesia, although the incidence of actual vomiting was not significantly different between the 2 groups. Since these effects were virtually absent in studies of intensive care patients and after sedation for short procedures, and were not seen in tolerability studies in healthy volunteers receiving intravenous bolus doses of up to 100mg, there may be a link between these symptoms and the other agents used in general anaesthesia, some of which have well-known emetic properties. Thus, flumazenil provides a safe and effective means of attenuating or reversing the CNS-depressant effects of benzodiazepines whenever indicated, e.g. following benzodiazepine-induced general anaesthesia, conscious sedation, or after benzodiazepine overdose, either alone or in combination with other agents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "output": "Which drug should be used as an antidote in benzodiazepine overdose?", "category": "Question Generation 1097.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage.", "input": "Pablo Zalba Bidegain (born 28 January 1975) is a Spanish economist and politician and has been a Member of the European Parliament (MEP), for the European People's Party, since June 2009.", "output": "Which political party was Pablo Zalba Bidegain in?", "category": "Question Generation 1097.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage.", "input": "In a time when a dangerous number of people are overweight, many people seem to have forgotten the most important way to keep healthy and slim---exercise. And as a new study carried out on mice in the lab has shown, exercise done early in life can reward you in your adult years. A team of researchers at the University of California studied the effects of early exercise on adult physical activity, body mass and eating. They found that early-age exercise in mice has positive effects on adult levels of voluntary exercise in addition to reducing body mass. \"These results may have an effect on the importance of regular physical education in elementary and middle schools,\" said Theodore Garland, a professor of biology, who led the research project. \"If kids exercise regularly through their school years, then they may be more likely to exercise as adults, which could have far-reaching positive effects on human health and well-being.\" Although the positive effects of early-life exercise lasted for only one week, it is important to note that one week in the life of a mouse is the same as about nine months for humans. \"Our results suggest that any positive effects of early-life exercise on adult exercise will need to be kept up if they are to be long-lasting.\" His team of researchers found, too, that all mice that had access to early exercise were lighter in weight than non-exercised mice. Garland explained that, in general, exercise will stimulate appetite sooner or later. However, it is possible that certain types of exercise, done for certain periods of time or at certain light levels, might not _ appetite much, if at all, at least in some individuals. \"If we could understand what sorts of exercise these might be, then we might be able to tailor exercise recommendations in a way that would bring the benefits of exercise without increase in appetite, leading to a better chance of weight loss,\" he said.", "output": "What is the article mainly about?", "category": "Question Generation 1097.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage.", "input": "Josef Marek (born 11 June 1987) is a professional Czech football player who plays for FK Viktoria Zizkov.", "output": "When is the date of birth of Josef Marek?", "category": "Question Generation 1097.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage.", "input": "Malaria is one of the most devastating infectious diseases in the developing world. Until now, only one candidate malaria vaccine RTS,S/AS01 has shown modest protection in phase 3 trial in African infants. Hence the treatment of malaria still depends on the current chemotherapeutic drugs. Considering the resistance of malaria parasites to almost all used antimalarial drugs, aiming at multi-targets rather than a single target will be a more promising strategy. Previous studies have shown that myricetin and fisetin exhibited in vitro antimalarial activity against Plasmodium falciparum, but very little research focused on the molecular mechanism for their parasiticidal activity. The cysteine protease falcipain-2 and aspartic protease plasmepsin II have long been considered as important antimalarial drug targets, especially combined inhibition of these two proteases. In this study, we determined that myricetin and fisetin are dual inhibitors of falcipain-2 and plasmepsin II, which might account for their antimalarial properties. Overall, the dual inhibition of falcipain-2 and plasmepsin II by myricetin and fisetin has shed light on a possible mechanism for their antimalarial activity and provided a rationale for further development as antimalarial drugs.", "output": "RTS S AS01 vaccine was developed to prevent which disease?", "category": "Question Generation 1097.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage.", "input": "The Wittig reaction was discovered in 1954 by Georg Wittig, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1979.", "output": "Who is the Wittig reaction named after?", "category": "Question Generation 1097.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage.", "input": "Asset Acceptance Capital Corp. is publicly traded (NASDAQ: AACC).", "output": "Which exchange is Asset Acceptance listed with?", "category": "Question Generation 1097.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage.", "input": "Maria Schalcken (1645 -- 1699), was a Dutch Golden Age painter, sister and pupil of Godfried Schalcken.", "output": "Who was the brother of Maria Schalcken?", "category": "Question Generation 1097.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage.", "input": "Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a potent mediator of inflammatory responses and plays a role in the differentiation of a number of lymphoid cells. In several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, serum levels of IL-1 are elevated and correlate with disease development and severity. The central role of the IL-1 pathway in several diseases has been validated by inhibitors currently in clinical development or approved by the FDA. However, the need to effectively modulate IL-1-mediated local inflammation with the systemic delivery of an efficacious, safe and convenient drug still exists. To meet these challenges, we developed XOMA 052 (gevokizumab), a potent anti-IL-1 neutralizing antibody that was designed in silico and humanized using Human Engineering\u2122 technology. XOMA 052 has a 300 femtomolar binding affinity for human IL-1 and an in vitro potency in the low picomolar range. XOMA 052 binds to a unique IL-1 epitope where residues critical for binding have been identified. We have previously reported that XOMA 052 is efficacious in vivo in a diet-induced obesity mouse model thought to be driven by low levels of chronic inflammation. We report here that XOMA 052 also reduces acute inflammation in vivo, neutralizing the effect of exogenously administered human IL-1 and blocking peritonitis in a mouse model of acute gout. Based on its high potency, novel mechanism of action, long half-life, and high affinity, XOMA 052 provides a new strategy for the treatment of a number of inflammatory, autoimmune and metabolic diseases in which the role of IL-1 is central to pathogenesis.", "output": "Which molecule is targeted by the drug Gevokizumab?", "category": "Question Generation 1097.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage.", "input": "To determine the validity of the rapid antigen test (RAT) OSOM StrepA Genzyme for the diagnosis of acute pharyngitis caused by group A beta-haemolytic strep (GABHS).

Here, we offer the first evidence that an antioxidant enzyme has a key role in this transition. We found that the antioxidant enzyme peroxiredoxin-2 (Prx2) inversely correlated with the metastatic capacity of human melanoma cells. Silencing Prx2 expression stimulated proliferation and migration, whereas ectopic expression of Prx2 produced the opposite effect. Mechanistic investigations indicated that Prx2 negatively regulated Src/ERK activation status, which in turn fortified adherens junctions function by increasing E-cadherin expression and phospho-Y654-dependent retention of -catenin in the plasma membrane. In murine melanoma cells, Prx2 silencing enhanced lung metastasis in vivo. Interestingly, the natural compound gliotoxin, which is known to exert a Prx-like activity, inhibited proliferation and migration as well as lung metastasis of Prx2-deficient melanoma cells.

Notably, Meisetz has catalytic activity for trimethylation, but not mono- or dimethylation, of lysine 4 of histone H3, and a transactivation activity that depends on its methylation activity. Mice in which the Meisetz gene is disrupted show sterility in both sexes due to severe impairment of the double-stranded break repair pathway, deficient pairing of homologous chromosomes and impaired sex body formation.

Different pathogenetic mechanisms have been identified, with the majority (95%) causing intragenic lesions. Single or multiexon NF1 copy number changes occur in about 2% of patients, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms behind these intragenic deletions. We report here on the molecular characterization of a novel NF1 multiexonic deletion. The application of a multidisciplinary approach including multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, allelic segregation analysis, and fluorescent in situ hybridization allowed us to map the breakpoints in IVS27b and IVS48. Furthermore, the breakpoint junction was characterized by sequencing. Using bioinformatic analysis, we identified some recombinogenic motifs in close proximity to the centromeric and telomeric breakpoints and predicted the presence of a mutated messenger ribonucleic acid, which was deleted between exons 28 and 48 and encodes a neurofibromin that lacks some domains essential for its function. Through reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, the expression of the mutated allele was verified, showing the junction between exons 27b and 49 and, as expected, was not subjected to nonsense-mediated decay. Multiexonic deletions represent 2% of NF1 mutations, and until now, the breakpoint has been identified in only a few cases.

The river was so polluted with oil and other industrial wastes that it was flammable. Nothing could live in it. You can see the Cuyahoga River in Figure 21.16 Disasters such as rivers burning led to new U.S. laws to protect the water. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was established, and the Clean Water Act was passed. Now, water is routinely tested. Pollution is tracked to its source, and polluters are forced to fix the problem and clean up the pollution. They are also fined. These consequences have led industries, agriculture, and communities to pollute the water much less than before. Most water pollution comes from industry, agriculture, and municipal sources. Homes are part of the municipal source and the individuals and families that live in them can pollute the water supply. What can you do to reduce water pollution? Read the tips below. Properly dispose of motor oil and household chemicals. Never pour them down the drain. Also, dont let them spill on the ground. This keeps them out of storm sewers and bodies of water. Use fewer lawn and garden chemicals. Use natural products instead. For example, use compost instead of fertilizer. Or grow plants that can thrive on their own without any extra help. Repair engine oil leaks right away. A steady drip of oil from an engine can quickly add up to gallons. When the oil washes off driveways and streets it can end up in storm drains and pollute the water supply. Dont let pet litter or pet wastes get into the water supply (see Figure 21.17). The nitrogen they contain can cause overgrowth of algae. The wastes may also contain bacteria and other causes of disease. Water treatment is a series of processes that remove unwanted substances from water. The goal of water treatment is to make the water safe to return to the natural environment or to the human water supply. Treating water for other purposes may not include all the same steps. Thats because water used in agriculture or industry may not have to be as clean as drinking water. You can see how water for drinking is treated in Figure 21.18. Treating drinking water requires at least four processes: 1. Chemicals are added to untreated water. They cause solids in the water to clump together. This is called coagulation. 2. The water is moved to tanks. The clumped solids sink to the bottom of the water. This is called sedimentation. 3. The water is passed through filters that remove smaller particles from the water. This is called filtration. 4. Chlorine is added to the water to kill bacteria and other microbes. This is called disinfection. Finally, the water is pure enough to drink. Conserving water means using less of it. Of course, this mostly applies to people in the wealthy nations that have the most water and also waste the most. Irrigation is the single biggest use of water. Overhead irrigation wastes a lot of water. Drip irrigation wastes a lot less. Figure 21.19 shows a drip irrigation system. Water pipes run over the surface of the ground. Tiny holes in the pipes are placed close to each plant. Water slowly drips out of the holes and soaks into the soil around the plants. Very little of the water evaporates or runs off the ground. Some communities save water with rationing. Much rationing takes place only during times of drought. During rationing, water may not be used for certain things. For example, communities may ban lawn watering and car washing. People may be fined if they use water in these ways. You can do your part. Follow any bans where you live. Its easy to save water at home. If you save even a few gallons a day you can make a big difference over the long run. The best place to start saving water is in the bathroom. Toilet flushing is the single biggest use of water in the home. Showers and baths are the next biggest use.

In 48 games, the Redskins led the series 24-23-1 and had won the last five meetings.

Despite such performances, the Redskins rush defense was ranked 29th in yards per carry with 4.64 and 25th in average rushing yards at 124.2. Jeff Joniak writes that the Bears could exploit this with the three-man rushing attack of Matt Forte, Jeremy Langford, and Ka'Deem Carey. On defense, the Bears faced a Kirk Cousins-led offense that focuses on quick passes; Cousins completed a league-high 68.6 percent of his passes, with 7.1 yards per pass. One of Cousins' main targets was tight end Jordan Reed, who scored six touchdowns and led the Redskins in yards after the catch. Rankings-wise, the pass attack was ranked 17th in the league in passing yards per game and 16th for yards per play. Joniak states that the Bears had to force turnovers, and an area was on third down, as five of Cousins' interceptions had been on third down. The Bears won the coin toss and elected to defer. Washington recorded a 15-play, 80-yard drive en route to scoring on Alfred Morris' one-yard touchdown run. After the Bears punted, the Redskins scored again with Cousins' fake read option leading to a three-yard touchdown run in the second quarter. Chicago's woes continued when the offense began the next drive on their own seven-yard line, and despite reaching the Washington 49, Jay Cutler was strip-sacked by Trent Murphy, who recovered the fumble. The Redskins failed to capitalize on the turnover and punted; the following two drives also ended with punts. With 52 seconds left in the first half, the Bears took over at their own 42, and managed to score with 18 seconds left when Cutler threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery. Cousins kneeled once to end the half. After the Bears punted on the first drive of the second half, Cousins threw a five-yard touchdown pass to Reed. The Bears responded with Cutler's nine-yard touchdown pass to Zach Miller, who managed to escape DeAngelo Hall and made contact with Goldson as he reached the endzone. The score was the Bears' first third quarter touchdown of 2015. Afterwards, Cousins' pass for Pierre Garcon was intercepted by Kyle Fuller, and the Bears took advantage with Forte's seven-yard touchdown run to tie the score. Dustin Hopkins gave the Redskins the 24-21 lead on the first drive of the final quarter with a 47-yard field goal.

Changes in the nucleotide sequences of enhancers may therefore lead to changes in gene expression, representing a central mechanism by which organisms evolve. With the development of the experimental technique of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), in which discrete regions of the genome bound by specific proteins can be identified, it is now possible to identify transcription factor binding events (putative cis-regulatory elements) in entire genomes. Comparing protein-DNA binding maps allows us, for the first time, to attempt to identify regulatory differences and infer global patterns of change in gene expression across species. Here, we review studies that used genome-wide ChIP to study the evolution of enhancers. The trend is one of high divergence of cis-regulatory elements between species, possibly compensated by extensive creation and loss of regulatory elements and rewiring of their target genes. We speculate on the meaning of the differences observed and discuss that although ChIP experiments identify the biochemical event of protein-DNA interaction, it cannot determine whether the event results in a biological function, and therefore more studies are required to establish the effect of divergence of binding events on species-specific gene expression.", "output": "Are human enhancers or promoters evolving faster?", "category": "Question Generation 1097.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage.", "input": "San Francisco kept Detroit in the game with missed opportunities, then made just enough plays for a rare two-game winning streak and its first road win.

He is late for a photo shoot with Veruschka von Lehndorff (playing herself) at his studio, which in turn makes him late for a shoot with other models later in the morning. He grows bored and walks off, leaving the models and production staff in the lurch. As he leaves the studio, two teenage girls who are aspiring models, a blond (Jane Birkin) and a dark-haired brunette (Gillian Hills) ask to speak with him, but the photographer drives off to look at an antiques shop.Wandering into Maryon Park, he takes photos of two lovers making out. The woman (Vanessa Redgrave) is furious at being photographed and demands that Thomas hand over the film, but he refuses. When she walks away to rejoin her boyfriend, he is gone and she runs away with Thomas taking photos of her as she runs.Thomas then meets his agent for lunch, and notices a man following him and looking into his car. Back at his studio, the mysterious woman from the park arrives asking for the film, but he refuses. The woman introduces herself as 'Jane' and tries to seduce Thomas by removing her top to entice him to hand over the film and negatives. Thomas agrees without going any further, but he deliberately hands Jane a different roll. She in turn writes down a telephone number to give to him.After Jane leaves, Thomas begins work on developing his photos that he took that day. His many enlargements of the black and white film are grainy but he finds something strange. In the Maryon Park photos, Thomas notices a figure hiding in the bushes near Jane and her boyfriend and upon enlarging them in a series of 'blow-up' shots, sees that it is a man with a gun (the same man he saw following him earlier). In the shots where Jane is running away with her back to the camera, Thomas also notices something on the ground in the distance. The blow-up shots of the blurred figure on the ground that Jane is running to appears to be a body in the grass. Thomas gets the feeling that he just witnessed the before and afterwards of a murder.Thomas is disturbed by a knock on the door, but it is only the two girls again, with whom he has a group-sex romp in his studio and falls asleep. Awakening, he finds they hope he will photograph them but he tells them to leave, saying, \"Tomorrow! Tomorrow!\"As evening falls, Thomas goes back to the park to investigate and finds a dead body (Jane's dead lover), but he has not brought his camera and is scared off by a twig breaking, as if being stepped on by someone unseen watching him. Thomas returns to his studio to find that someone (possibly Jane and her gunman accomplice) has broken into his place and all the negatives and prints from the park are gone except for one large, very grainy blowup showing the body (which proves nothing). He tries to call the phone number Jane gave him, but learns from the operator that the number does not exist.After driving into town, Thomas sees Jane walking alone on a sidewalk and he pulls his car over and follows her on foot into a night club where The Yardbirds, featuring both Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck on guitar, are seen playing. Thomas moves to confront Jane, but she sees him and runs. Thomas loses her on the crowded street.Thomas then goes to a drug-drenched party in a house on the Thames near central London. He finds a strung-out Veruschka, who had told him that she was going to Paris, and when confronted, she says she is in Paris.

Temple was 3 when her mother put her in dance school, where a talent scout spotted her and got her in Baby Burlesks, a series of short movies with child actors playing in adult movies. Movie studio directors took notice of her and in 1934 she appeared in the film Stand Up and Cheer! and her song and dance caught people's attention. Movies such as Little Miss Marker and Bright Eyes featured her signature song. In 1935, she received a special Oscar for her \"outstanding contribution to screen entertainment\" in the movie Stand Up and Cheer! She made some 40 feature movies, including The Little Colonel, Poor Little Rich Girl, Heidi and Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, in 10 years, starring with big-name actors like Randolph Scott, Lionel Barrymore and Jimmy Durante. Temple was a superstar before the term was invented. She said she was about 8 when crowds shouting their love for her made her realize she was famous. \"I wondered why,\" she recalled. \"I asked my mother and she said, 'Because your films make them happy.' \" Her child career came to an end at 12. She tried a few roles as a teenager--including opposite future president Ronald Reagan in That Hagen Girl - but retired from the screen in 1949 at 21.

Electrons are tiny, negatively charged particles in an atom that move around the positive nucleus at the center. Energy levels are a little like the steps of a staircase. You can stand on one step or another but not in between the steps. The same goes for electrons. They can occupy one energy level or another but not the space between energy levels. The model in the Figure 1.1 shows the first four energy levels of an atom. Electrons in energy level I (also called energy level K) have the least amount of energy. As you go farther from the nucleus, electrons at higher levels have more energy, and their energy increases by a fixed, discrete amount. Electrons can jump from a lower to the next higher energy level if they absorb this amount of energy. Conversely, if electrons jump from a higher to a lower energy level, they give off energy, often in the form of light. This explains the fireworks pictured above. When the fireworks explode, electrons gain energy and jump to higher energy levels. When they jump back to their original energy levels, they release the energy as light. Different atoms have different arrangements of electrons, so they give off light of different colors. Q: In the atomic model Figure 1.1, where would you find electrons that have the most energy? A: Electrons with the most energy would be found in energy level IV. The smallest atoms are hydrogen atoms. They have just one electron orbiting the nucleus. That one electron is in the first energy level. Bigger atoms have more electrons. Electrons are always added to the lowest energy level first until it has the maximum number of electrons possible. Then electrons are added to the next higher energy level until that level is full, and so on. How many electrons can a given energy level hold? The maximum numbers of electrons possible for the first four energy levels are shown in the Figure 1.1. For example, energy level I can hold a maximum of two electrons, and energy level II can hold a maximum of eight electrons. The maximum number depends on the number of orbitals at a given energy level. An orbital is a volume of space within an atom where an electron is most likely to be found. As you can see by the images in the Figure 1.2, some orbitals are shaped like spheres (S orbitals) and some are shaped like dumbbells (P orbitals). There are other types of orbitals as well. Regardless of its shape, each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons. Energy level I has just one orbital, so two electrons will fill this energy level. Energy level II has four orbitals, so it takes eight electrons to fill this energy level. Q: Energy level III can hold a maximum of 18 electrons. How many orbitals does this energy level have? A: At two electrons per orbital, this energy level must have nine orbitals. Electrons in the outermost energy level of an atom have a special significance. These electrons are called valence electrons, and they determine many of the properties of an atom. An atom is most stable if its outermost energy level contains as many electrons as it can hold. For example, helium has two electrons, both in the first energy level. This energy level can hold only two electrons, so heliums only energy level is full. This makes helium a very stable element. In other words, its atoms are unlikely to react with other atoms. Consider the elements fluorine and lithium, modeled in the Figure 1.3. Fluorine has seven of eight possible electrons in its outermost energy level, which is energy level II. It would be more stable if it had one more electron because this would fill its outermost energy level. Lithium, on the other hand, has just one of eight possible electrons in its outermost energy level (also energy level II). It would be more stable if it had one less electron because it would have a full outer energy level (now energy level I).

Ocular expression of LOX and LOXL2 was investigated by immunohistologic staining at different time points after trabeculectomy.

LOX and LOXL2 were both upregulated in Tenon's capsule and the conjunctiva after glaucoma surgery. Repeated administration of LOX- or LOXL2-targeting monoclonal antibodies increased bleb area and bleb survival.

Although the concept of DNA repair coupled with transcription has been widely accepted, its mechanisms remain elusive.

To test this hypothesis, we constructed transfectant cell lines containing a single, actively transcribed APRT gene, integrated at different genomic sites. Mapping of CPD repair in the integrated APRT genes in three transfectant cell lines revealed two distinct repair patterns, either preferential repair of CPDs in the transcribed strand or very poor repair in both strands. Similar kinetics of micrococcal nuclease digestion were seen for all three transfectant APRT gene domains and endogenous APRT locus.

On average, the temperature gradient of the troposphere is 6.5o C per 1,000 m (3.6o F per 1,000 ft) of altitude. Earths surface is the source of heat for the troposphere. Rock, soil, and water on Earth absorb the Suns light and radiate it back into the atmosphere as heat, so there is more heat near the surface. The temperature is also higher near the surface because gravity pulls in more gases. The greater density of gases causes the temperature to rise. Notice that in the troposphere warmer air is beneath cooler air. This condition is unstable since warm air is less dense than cool air. The warm air near the surface rises and cool air higher in the troposphere sinks, so air in the troposphere does a lot of mixing. This mixing causes the temperature gradient to vary with time and place. The rising and sinking of air in the troposphere means that all of the planets weather takes place in the troposphere. Sometimes there is a temperature inversion, in which air temperature in the troposphere increases with altitude and warm air sits over cold air. Inversions are very stable and may last for several days or even weeks. Inversions form: Over land at night or in winter when the ground is cold. The cold ground cools the air that sits above it, making this low layer of air denser than the air above it. Near the coast, where cold seawater cools the air above it. When that denser air moves inland, it slides beneath the warmer air over the land. Since temperature inversions are stable, they often trap pollutants and produce unhealthy air conditions in cities (Figure 1.1). Smoke makes a temperature inversion visible. The smoke is trapped in cold dense air that lies beneath a cap of warmer air. At the top of the troposphere is a thin layer in which the temperature does not change with height. This means that the cooler, denser air of the troposphere is trapped beneath the warmer, less dense air of the stratosphere. Air from the troposphere and stratosphere rarely mix.

STIs are caused by pathogens, a living thing or virus that causes infection. The pathogens enter the body through the reproductive organs. Many STIs also spread through body fluids, such as blood. For example, a shared tattoo needle is one way an STI could spread. Some STIs can also spread from a mother to her baby during childbirth. STIs are more common in teens and young adults than in older people. One reason is that young people are more likely to take risks. They also may not know how STIs spread. They are likely to believe myths about STIs ( Table Myth If you are sexually active with just one person, you cant get STIs. If you dont have any symptoms, then you dont have an STI. Getting STIs is no big deal, because STIs can be cured with medicine. Fact The only way to avoid the risk of STIs is to practice abstinence from sexual activity. Many STIs do not cause symptoms, especially in fe- males. Only some STIs can be cured with medicine; other STIs cannot be cured. Most STIs are caused by bacteria or viruses. STIs caused by bacteria usually can be cured with drugs called antibiotics. But antibiotics are not effective against viruses. Therefore, STIs caused by viruses are not treated with antibiotics. Other drugs may be used to help control the symptoms of viral STIs, but they cannot be cured. Once you have a viral STI, you are usually infected for life. In the U.S., chlamydia is the most common STI caused by bacteria. Females are more likely than males to develop the infection. Rates of chlamydia among U.S. females in 2006 are shown below ( Figure 1.1). Rates were much higher in teens and young women than in other age groups. Chlamydia may cause a burning feeling during urination. It may also cause a discharge (leaking of fluids) from the vagina or penis. But in many cases it causes no symptoms. As a result, people do not know they are infected, so they dont go to the doctor for help. If chlamydia goes untreated, it may cause more serious problems in females. It may cause infections of the uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries. These infections may leave a woman unable to have children. Gonorrhea is another common STI. Gonorrhea may cause pain during urination. It may also cause a discharge from the vagina or penis. On the other hand, some people with gonorrhea have no symptoms. As a result, they dont seek treatment. Without treatment, gonorrhea may lead to infection of other reproductive organs. This can happen in males as well as females. Syphilis is a very serious STI. Luckily, it is less common than chlamydia or gonorrhea. Syphilis usually begins with a small sore on the genitals. This is followed a few months later by a rash and flu-like symptoms. If syphilis is not treated, it may damage the heart, brain, and other organs. It can even cause death. Genital warts are an STI caused by human papilloma virus, or HPV. They are one of the most common STIs in teenagers. HPV infections cannot be cured. But a new vaccine called Gardasil can prevent most HPV infections in females. Many doctors recommend that females between the ages of 9 and 26 years receive the vaccine. Preventing HPV infections in females is important because HPV can also cause cancer of the cervix. A related herpes virus causes cold sores on the lips ( Figure 1.2). Both viruses cause painful blisters. In the case of genital herpes, the blisters are on the penis or around the vaginal opening. The blisters go away on their own, but the virus remains in the body. The blisters may come back repeatedly, especially when a person is under stress. There is no cure for genital herpes.

The sections on Treblinka include testimony from Abraham Bomba, who survived as a barber;[5] Richard Glazar, an inmate; and Franz Suchomel, an SS officer who worked at the camp, who reveals intricate details of the camp's gas chamber. Bomba breaks down while describing how a barber friend of his came across his wife and sister while cutting hair in an anteroom of the gas chamber. Suchomel states he did not know about extermination at Treblinka until he arrived there. This section includes Henryk Gawkowski, who said he drove one of the transport trains while intoxicated with vodka. Gawkowski's photograph appears on the poster used for the film's marketing campaign. Testimonies on Auschwitz are provided by Rudolf Vrba, who escaped from the camp before the end of the war; and Filip Muller, who worked in an incinerator burning the bodies from the gassings. Muller recounts what prisoners said to him, and describes the experience of personally going into the gas chamber: bodies were piled up by the doors 'like stones'. He breaks down as he recalls the prisoners starting to sing while being forced into the gas chamber. Accounts include some from local villagers, who witnessed trains heading daily to the camp and returning empty; they quickly guessed the fate of those on board. Lanzmann also interviews bystanders. He asks whether they knew what was going on in the death camps. Their answers reveal that they did but they justified their inaction by the fear of death. Two survivors of Chemno are interviewed: Simon Srebnik, who was forced to sing military songs to entertain the Nazis; and Mordechai Podchlebnik. Lanzmann also has a secretly filmed interview with Franz Schalling, a German security guard, who describes the workings of Chemno. Walter Stier, a former Nazi bureaucrat, describes the workings of the railways. Stier insists he was too busy managing railroad traffic to notice his trains were transporting Jews to their deaths. The Warsaw ghetto is described by Jan Karski, who worked for the Polish government-in-exile and Franz Grassler, a Nazi administrator who liaised with Jewish leaders. A Christian, Karski snuck into the Warsaw ghetto and escaped to England to try to convince the Allied governments to intervene more strongly on behalf of the Jews, but failed to do so. Memories from Jewish survivors of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising conclude the documentary. Lanzmann also interviews Holocaust historian Raul Hilberg, who discusses the historical significance of Nazi propaganda against the European Jews, and the Nazi development of the Final Solution. The complete text of the film was published in 1985. The man in the poster[edit] During his trip to Poland in July 1978, Lanzmann's crew filmed his conversations with an elderly Polish man by the name of Henryk Gawkowski, who, some 35 years earlier, had worked on the locomotives pulling Holocaust trains to Treblinka during World War II.[6] The photograph used for the film poster shows Gawkoski on a locomotive to Treblinka, but there was no reconstruction of events from his youth: the type of locomotives used in 1943 were different, as was the landscape. The female translator insists on calling him the train's operator (or conductor in Polish); nevertheless, Gawkowski informed that he only shoveled coal into the engine's firebox, and that two German officers were always on every train. What happened to the victims, Gawkowski said, was not his fault, adding emphatically that if he had the opportunity, he would have been the first to slash Hitler's throat.[6]", "output": "What were some of director Claude Lanzmann's interviews of his subjects filmed in?", "category": "Question Generation 1097.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage.", "input": "Wouter Claes (born 28 October 1975 in Leuven, Belgium) is a male left-handed Belgian badminton player.", "output": "What is the sex or gender of Wouter Claes?", "category": "Question Generation 1097.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage.", "input": "Athole Shearer (November 20, 1900 -- March 17, 1985) was an actress most noted as the sister of motion picture star Norma Shearer and film sound engineer Douglas Shearer.", "output": "Who is Athole Shearer's sister?", "category": "Question Generation 1097.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage.", "input": "There have been several milestones in the Paralympic movement.

One way to make a code is to represent each letter of the alphabet by a different number. Then you can send a coded message by writing words as strings of digits. This is similar to how information is encoded using an electric current. The voltage of the current is changed rapidly and repeatedly to encode a message, called an electronic signal. There are two different types of electronic signals: analog signals and digital signals. Both are illustrated in Figure 23.20. A digital signal consists of pulses of voltage, created by repeatedly switching the current off and on. This type of signal encodes information as a string of 0s (current off) and 1s (current on). This is called a binary (\"two-digit\") code. DVDs, for example, encode sounds and pictures as digital signals. An analog signal consists of continuously changing voltage in a circuit. For example, microphones encode sounds as analog signals. Electronic components are the parts used in electronic devices such as computers. The components transmit and change electric current. They are made of materials called semiconductors. A semiconductor is a solid crystalusually consisting mainly of siliconthat can conduct current better than an electric insulator but not as well as an electric conductor. Very small amounts of other elements, such as boron or phosphorus, are added to the silicon so it can conduct current. A semiconductor is illustrated in Figure 23.21. There are two different types of semiconductors: n-type and p-type. An n-type semiconductor consists of silicon and an element such as phosphorus that gives the silicon crystal extra electrons. An n-type semiconductor is like the negative terminal in a chemical cell. A p-type semiconductor consists of silicon and an element such as boron that gives the silicon positively charged holes where electrons are missing. A p-type semiconductor is like the positive terminal in a chemical cell. Electronic components contain many semiconductors. Types of components include diodes, transistors, and inte- grated circuits. Each type is described in Table 23.2. Electronic Component Diode Transistor Integrated Circuit (Microchip) Description A diode consists of a p-type and an n-type semicon- ductor placed side by side. When a diode is connected by leads to a source of voltage, electrons flow from the n-type to the p-type semiconductor. This is the only direction that electrons can flow in a diode. This makes a diode useful for changing alternating current to direct current. A transistor consists of three semiconductors, either p- n-p or n-p-n. Current cant flow through a transistor unless a small amount of current is applied to the center semiconductor (through the base). Then a much larger current can flow through the transistor from end to end (from collector to emitter). This means that a transmitter can be used as a switch, with pulses of a small current turning a larger current on and off. A transistor can also be used to increase the amount of current flowing through a circuit. You can learn more about transistors and how they work at this URL: http An integrated circuitalso called a microchipis a tiny, flat piece of silicon that consists of layers of elec- tronic components such as transistors. An integrated circuit as small as a fingernail can contain millions of electronic components. Current flows extremely rapidly in an integrated circuit because it doesnt have far to travel. You can learn how microprocessors are made at this URL: Many of the devices you commonly use are electronic. Electronic devices include computers, mobile phones, TV remotes, DVD and CD players, game systems, MP3 players, and digital cameras. All of these devices use electric current to encode, analyze, or transmit information. Consider the computer as an example of an electronic device. A computer contains microchips with millions of tiny electronic components. Information is encoded as 0s and 1s and transmitted as electrical pulses.

The p22(phox)-complexed Nox2 and Nox1 are dormant on their own, and their activation requires soluble supportive proteins such as a Nox organizer (p47(phox) or Noxo1) and a Nox activator (p67(phox) or Noxa1). The small GTPase Rac directly binds to the activators, and thus plays an essential role in the Nox2-based oxidase containing p47(phox) and p67(phox) or a positive role in Nox1 activity supported by Noxo1 and Noxa1. Although Nox3 complexed with p22(phox) constitutively produce superoxide, the production can be enhanced by supportive proteins. Here we compare the roles of Rac in these p22(phox)-dependent oxidases using the organizer and activator in different combinations. Expression of constitutively active Rac1(Q61L) is essential for activation of the Nox2- or Nox1-based oxidase containing the organizer p47(phox) and either p67(phox) or Noxa1. When these oxidases use Noxo1 as an organizer instead of p47(phox), they produce a small but significant amount of superoxide without expression of Rac1(Q61L), although the production is enhanced by Rac1(Q61L). Thus p47(phox) is likely related to strict dependence on Rac. The Nox3-based oxidase has a similar tendency in the change of the dependence: Rac plays a positive role in Nox3 activation in the presence of p47(phox) and either p67(phox) or Noxa1, whereas Rac fails to upregulate Nox3 activity when p47(phox) is replaced with Noxo1. We also demonstrate that, in the Nox3-based oxidase containing solely p67(phox) as supportive protein, expression of Rac1(Q61L) enhances not only superoxide production but also membrane translocation of p67(phox). Since the enhancements are not observed with a mutant p67(phox) defective in binding to Rac, this GTPase appear to directly recruit p67(phox) to the membrane.", "output": "Which NADPH oxidase family member requires interaction with NOXO1 for function?", "category": "Question Generation 1097.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage.", "input": "Edward Percy Smith (5 January 1891 -- 27 May 1968) was a Conservative Party politician in the United Kingdom.", "output": "Which political party was Edward Percy Smith a member of?", "category": "Question Generation 1097.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage.", "input": "How quickly is the human population growing? If we look at worldwide human population growth from 10,000 BCE through today, our growth looks like exponential growth. It increased very slowly at first, but later grew faster and faster as the population increased in size ( Figure 1.1). And recently, the human population has increased at a faster pace than ever before. It has taken only 12 years for the worlds population to increase from six billion to seven billion. Considering that in the year 1804, there were just one billion people, and in 1927, there were just two billion people (thats 123 years to increase from 1 to 2 billion), the recent increase in the human population growth rate is characteristic of exponential growth. Does this mean there are unlimited resources? Worldwide human population growth from 10,000 BCE through today. On the other hand, if you look at human population growth in specific countries, you may see a different pattern. On the level of a country, the history of human population growth can be divided into five stages, as described in Table 1.1. Some countries have very high birth rates, in some countries the growth rate has stabilized, and in some countries the growth rate is in decline. Stage 1 2 3 4 5 Description Birth and death rates are high and population growth is stable. This occurred in early human history. Significant drop in death rate, resulting in exponential growth. This occurred in 18th- and 19th-century Eu- rope. Population size continues to grow. Birth rates equal death rates and populations become stable. Total population size may level off. The United Nations and the U.S. Census Bureau predict that by 2050, the Earth will be populated by 9.4 billion people. Other estimates predict 10 to 11 billion. There are two different beliefs about what type of growth the human population will undergo in the future: 1. Neo-Malthusians believe that human population growth cannot continue without destroying the environment, and maybe humans themselves. 2. Cornucopians believe that the Earth can give humans a limitless amount of resources. They also believe that technology can solve problems caused by limited resources, such as lack of food. The Cornucopians believe that a larger population is good for technology and innovation. The 5-stage model above predicts that when all countries are industrialized, the human population will eventually level out. But many scientists and other Neo-Malthusians believe that humans have already gone over the Earths carrying capacity. That means, we may have already reached the maximum population size that can be supported, without destroying our resources and habitat. If this is true, then human overpopulation will lead to a lack of food and other resources. Overpopulation may also lead to increased disease, and/or war. These problems may cause the population of humans to crash. If these issues are not controlled, could the human population go extinct? Which of the above theories makes sense to you?

Six patients had major cytogenetic responses after dose increase (3 complete and 3 partial). Two others had minor cytogenetic responses. Two patients with clonal evolution transiently lost the additional clonal aberrations. Almost all of the responses occurred within 6 months, and were typically 3-6 months in duration. However, 3 patients have continuing major cytogenetic responses of >18 months duration. Dose increase was well tolerated, with thrombocytopenia, mild leukopenia, and exacerbation of prior edema being the most common adverse events. Although increasing the dose of imatinib can benefit a subgroup of patients with CML with either an inadequate cytogenetic response or disease progression, our results suggest the majority will not have a sustained meaningful response, and that other options, such as allogeneic stem cell transplant or investigational therapies, also need to be considered at the time of dose increase.", "output": "What tyrosine kinase, involved in a Philadelphia- chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukemia, is the target of Imatinib (Gleevec)?", "category": "Question Generation 1097.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage.", "input": "Arnus Vallis is an ancient river valley in the Syrtis Major quadrangle of Mars, located at 14.1 north latitude and 289.5 west longitude.", "output": "What celestial body can Arnus Vallis be found on?", "category": "Question Generation 1097.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage.", "input": "The film begins with Sybil as a young woman working as a substitute teacher in New York City, she experience blackouts, memory lapses and disturbing imagery (memories). Sibyl decides to seek medical intervention after putting her hand through a window in her apartment while experiencing one of her episodes. It is here that she meets Dr. Wilbur who is called in for a neurological consult. Dr. Wilbur takes an interest in Sybil and finds out from her that she has been having these episodes for as long as she can remember. Dr. Wilbur then explains to Sybil that she is suffering from a kind of hysteria that causes her to black out under conditions of fear. Dr. Wilber then offers to take Sybil on as a patient. The next scene shows Sybil discussing the possibility of seeking medical care for her moodiness with her father who is very skeptical, and mentions how their church feels about the practitioners of the mind. Sybil then loses her job. She phones Dr. Wilbur at 3 a.m., as Vicky, as Sybil is contemplating jumping out of a hotel room window several stories up. There is shown a flashback to Sybils childhood to a traumatic scene when she had her tonsils removed. It is in this scene that Dr. Wilbur discovers the multiple personalities that reside within Sybil. Dr. Wilbur is shown speaking with another psychotherapist, apparently her mentor, who warns her not to fall in love with the patients illness, as this may contribute to more suggestible symptoms. As the film progresses, many of Sybils different personalities are showcased as telling things about one another and Sybil, telling things that Sybil cannot discuss on her own. After dissecting the stories that each personality is telling to Dr. Wilbur, Dr. Wilbur decides that it was some sort of traumatic childhood event that has caused Sybils personality to shatter. By this time Sybil is becoming friends with a male neighbor, Richard a young widower with a small son, who seems to be very taken with her. Sybil continues to undergo therapy with Dr. Wilbur and continues to exhibit her personalities, changing personalities at times of stress. Dr. Wilbur attempts to explain to Sybil that she was traumatized during childhood causing her personality to split into many childlike personalities; Sybil does not want to accept this explanation for what is happening to her. Upon hearing herself imitate her own mother, she disassociates into a baby. Sybil continues to see Richard and their relationship progresses, on Christmas Eve Sybil agrees to let Richard stay the night, he agrees that he will only hold her close. Sybil has a nightmare in which she is being pursued by a decapitated cat and ends up climbing to the top of her bookcase, waking Richard. It is at this time she discloses to Richard that she is seeing a Dr. Wilbur. He guesses that Dr. Wilbur is a psychiatrist and runs to the nearest payphone and calls information to get Dr. Wilburs phone number. He calls Dr. Wilbur, who is at a dinner party; Dr. Wilbur breaches patient/client confidentiality and discloses to Richard that Sybil suffers from multiple personality. Sybil then climbs to the roof of the building and Richard asks Dr. Wilbur to come right away. Upon her arrival, Dr. Wilbur finds Richard holding Sybil who had just made an attempt to jump off the roof of the building. While under the effects of the medication Sybil discloses that she does not want to see Richard anymore until she gets herself together, as she is falling in love with him. Richard hears this and moves out of his apartment. Fast forward a few months, Sybil is in Dr. Wilburs office, she denies that she has multiple personality, she states that she had been putting on an act all along and that her mother never abused her. Dr. Wilbur is not sure she believes Sybil, but thinks this may be the beginning of her healing in that the personalities are coming together as one. Dr. Wilbur decides to take an investigatory trip to Chicago to speak to Sibyls father, and then to Sybils hometown in Wisconsin and visits Sibyls pediatrician.

With profits down, Flynt decides to publish a newsletter for the club, the first Hustler magazine, with nude pictures of women working at the club. The newsletter soon becomes a full-fledged magazine, but sales are weak. In 1975, after Hustler publishes nude pictures of former first lady Jackie Kennedy Onassis, sales take off.Flynt becomes smitten with Althea Leasure (Courtney Love), a stripper who works at one of his clubs. With Althea and Jimmy's help, Flynt makes a fortune from sales of Hustler. With his success comes enemies - as he finds himself a hated figure of anti-pornography activists. He argues with the activists, saying that \"murder is illegal, but if you take a picture of it you may get your name in a magazine or maybe win a Pulitzer Prize\". \"However\", he continues, \"sex is legal, but if you take a picture of that act, you can go to jail\". He becomes involved in several prominent court cases, and befriends a young lawyer, Alan Isaacman (Edward Norton). In 1975, Flynt loses a smut-peddling court decision in Cincinnati but is released from jail soon afterwards on a technicality. Ruth Carter Stapleton (Hanover), a Christian activist and sister of President Jimmy Carter, seeks out Flynt and urges him to give his life to Jesus. Flynt seems moved and starts letting his newfound religion influence everything in his life, including Hustler content.In 1978, during another trial in Georgia, Flynt and Isaacman are both shot by a man with a rifle while they walk outside a courthouse. Isaacman recovers, but Flynt is paralyzed from the waist down and uses a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Wishing he was dead, Flynt renounces God. Because of the emotional and physical pain, he moves to Beverly Hills, California and spirals down into depression and drug use. During this time, Althea also becomes addicted to painkillers and morphine.In 1983, Flynt undergoes back surgery to deaden several nerves, and as a result, feels rejuvenated. He returns to an active role with the publication, which, in his absence, had been run by Althea and Jimmy. That same year, Flynt is soon in court again for leaking videos relating to the John DeLorean entrapment case, and during his courtroom antics, he fires Isaacman, then throws an orange at the judge. He later wears an American flag as an adult diaper along with an army helmet, and wears T-shirts with provocative messages such as \"I Wish I Was Black\" and \"Fuck This Court.\" After spitting water at the judge Flynt is sent to a psychiatric ward, where he sinks into depression again. He is diagnosed with having bipolar disorder and forced to take treatment.During this time, Flynt publishes a satirical parody ad in which Christian fundamentalist preacher Jerry Falwell tells of a sexual encounter with his mother. Falwell sues for libel and emotional distress. Flynt countersues for copyright infringement, because Falwell copied his ad. The case goes to trial in December 1984, but the decision is mixed, as Flynt is found guilty of inflicting emotional distress but not libel.By that time, Althea has contracted HIV, which proceeds to AIDS. Some time later in 1987, Flynt finds her dead in the bathtub, having drowned. Flynt presses Isaacman to appeal the Falwell decision to the Supreme Court of the United States. Isaacman refuses, saying Flynt's courtroom antics humiliated him. Flynt pleads with him, saying that he \"wants to be remembered for something meaningful\". Isaacman agrees and argues the \"emotional distress\" decision in front of the Supreme Court, in the case Hustler Magazine v. Falwell in 1988.

Organic compounds are molecules built around the element carbon (C). Living things are made up of very large molecules. These large molecules are called macromolecules because macro means large; they are made by smaller molecules bonding together. Our body gets these smaller molecules, the \"building blocks\" or monomers, of organic molecules from the food we eat. Which organic molecules do you recognize from the list below? The four main types of macromolecules found in living organisms, shown in Table 1.1, are: 1. 2. 3. 4. Proteins. Carbohydrates. Lipids. Nucleic Acids.

An important role of carbohydrates is to store energy. Glucose ( Figure 1.1) is an important simple sugar molecule with the chemical formula C6 H12 O6 . Simple sugars are known as monosaccharides. Carbohydrates also include long chains of connected sugar molecules. These long chains often consist of hundreds or thousands of monosaccharides bonded together to form polysaccharides. Plants store sugar in polysaccharides called starch. Animals store sugar in polysaccharides called glycogen. You get the carbohydrates you need for energy from eating carbohydrate-rich foods, including fruits and vegetables, as well as grains, such as bread, rice, or corn. A molecule of glucose, a type of carbohy- drate. Proteins are molecules that have many different functions in living things. All proteins are made of monomers called amino acids ( Figure 1.2) that connect together like beads on a necklace ( Figure 1.3). There are only 20 common amino acids needed to build proteins. These amino acids form in thousands of different combinations, making about 100,000 or more unique proteins in humans. Proteins can differ in both the number and order of amino acids. It is the number and order of amino acids that determines the shape of the protein, and it is the shape (structure) of the protein that determines the unique function of the protein. Small proteins have just a few hundred amino acids. The largest proteins have more than 25,000 amino acids. This model shows the general structure of all amino acids. Only the side chain, R, varies from one amino acid to another. KEY: H = hydrogen, N = nitrogen, C = carbon, O = oxygen, R = variable side chain. Many important molecules in your body are proteins. Examples include enzymes, antibodies, and muscle fiber. Enzymes are a type of protein that speed up chemical reactions. They are known as \"biological catalysts.\" For example, your stomach would not be able to break down food if it did not have special enzymes to speed up the rate of digestion. Antibodies that protect you against disease are proteins. Muscle fiber is mostly protein ( Figure 1.4). Muscle fibers are made mostly of protein. Its important for you and other animals to eat food with protein, because we cannot make certain amino acids on our own. You can get proteins from plant sources, such as beans, and from animal sources, like milk or meat. When you eat food with protein, your body breaks the proteins down into individual amino acids and uses them to build new proteins. You really are what you eat! Have you ever tried to put oil in water? They dont mix. Oil is a type of lipid. Lipids are molecules such as fats, oils, and waxes. The most common lipids in your diet are probably fats and oils.

As molecules are moving against their concentration gradients, active transport cannot occur without assistance. A carrier protein is always required in this process. Like facilitated diffusion, a protein in the membrane carries the molecules across the membrane, except this protein moves the molecules from a low concentration to a high concentration. These proteins are often called \"pumps\" because they use energy to pump the molecules across the membrane. There are many cells in your body that use pumps to move molecules. For example, your nerve cells (neurons) would not send messages to your brain unless you had protein pumps moving molecules by active transport. The sodium-potassium pump ( Figure 1.1) is an example of an active transport pump. The sodium-potassium pump uses ATP to move three sodium (Na+ ) ions and two potassium (K+ ) ions to where they are already highly concentrated.

However, the main thrust of his attack was at Kanchanaburi. His 20,000-strong main southern army invaded via the Myitta Pass. Kanchanaburi fell with little resistance. The main reason for the quick fall of Kanchanaburi could be that the Burmese were more battle-hardened. But it could also be that the Siamese command miscalculated where the Burmese main attack would come from, and had not sufficiently reinforced the fort to withstand a major attack. Judging by the Siamese chronicles' reporting of the main attack route, the Siamese command appeared to have believed that the main Burmese attack would come from the Gulf of Siam coastline, instead of the most obvious and shortest route via Kanchanaburi.

Each combination of plate types continent- continent, continent-ocean, and ocean-ocean creates mountains. Two converging continental plates smash upwards to create gigantic mountain ranges (Figure 1.1). Stresses from this uplift cause folds, reverse faults, and thrust faults, which allow the crust to rise upwards. As was stated previously there is currently no mountain range of this type in the western U.S., but we can find one where India is pushing into Eurasia. (a) The worlds highest mountain range, the Himalayas, is growing from the colli- sion between the Indian and the Eurasian plates. (b) The crumpling of the Indian and Eurasian plates of continental crust creates the Himalayas. Subduction of oceanic lithosphere at convergent plate boundaries also builds mountain ranges. This happens on continental crust, as in the Andes Mountains (Figure 1.2), or on oceanic crust, as with the Aleutian Islands, which we visited earlier. The Cascades Mountains of the western U.S. are also created this way. The Andes Mountains are a chain of con- tinental arc volcanoes that build up as the Nazca Plate subducts beneath the South American Plate. Amazingly, even divergence can create mountain ranges. When tensional stresses pull crust apart, it breaks into blocks that slide up and drop down along normal faults. The result is alternating mountains and valleys, known as a basin-and-range (Figure 1.3). In basin-and-range, some blocks are uplifted to form ranges, known as horsts, and some are down-dropped to form basins, known as grabens. (a) Horsts and grabens.

Then it flashes back to three years earlier and the film continues forward from there, interspersed with occasional bits from the interrogation. Three years before getting caught, Bridget Cardigan (Diane Keaton) lived a comfortable upper middle class life until her husband Don Cardigan (Ted Danson) was \"downsized\" from his position and sank into debt. The paycheck for Selina, the housecleaner, bounces again. Selina confronts Bridget and suggests she take a job as a janitor at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. On her first day on the job, Bridget hatches a scheme to steal worn-out dollar bills slated for destruction. For her team she chooses Nina (Queen Latifah), who works the dollar bill shredder, and Jackie (Katie Holmes), who takes bill carts from the Secret Service room to the shredding room. It takes some work to persuade Nina to join, but Jackie joins them quickly. The plan is that in the Secret Service room Bridget will switch a cart's official Master-brand lock with a near identical lock she purchased at Home Depot. Bridget will tell Jackie the cart number and give Nina the official lock. When Jackie gets the chosen cart, she dumps some bills from the cart into a trash can before taking the cart to Nina, who then uses Bridget's key to open it and restores the official lock, and then proceeds to shred the remaining bills. Meanwhile, Bridget, in the course of her janitorial duties, retrieves the dumped bills from the trash and splits them among Nina and Jackie in the women's restroom. Their first robbery is a success though the take is not as big as they had hoped. However, they're emboldened to do it repeatedly. Once Don and Bridget pay off their debt, Don suggests they stop before they get caught. Bridget rejects this idea and persuades Nina and Jackie to keep going. They almost get caught but they end up cutting in Barry (Roger Cross), one of the security guards, who is attracted to Nina. A Federal Bank Examiner shows up at a party at Bridget's house, and the next day Bridget sees him at work. The Examiner confronts Glover (Stephen Root), who is unwilling as a matter of professional pride to admit anyone has stolen a single bill out of his bank. Tipped off, that night Bridget and her accomplices begin trying to get rid of all the loot stashed in their houses, but the cops move in before all the evidence is destroyed. Bridget escapes but the others get caught. Bridget hires a tax attorney to defend them. The lawyer gets Bridget and all her accomplices off the hook for their crimes, because neither the law enforcement, nor the examiner can prove that the large stash of cash in their homes came from the Federal Reserve Bank. Technically, it isn't illegal to have a couple of hundred thousand dollars in cash lying around inside a private residence. However, they spent a large sum of that stolen cash to buy expensive objects and improvements on their houses, and did not pay the taxes for them because they couldn't justify the income. The IRS demands they pay their taxes, which turn out to be equal in amount to the money that still remains.

RLS may also be secondary to a number of conditions including iron deficiency, pregnancy and end-stage renal failure and, perhaps, neuropathy. Secondary RLS is most common in those presenting for the first time in later life. The pathogenesis of RLS probably involves the interplay of systemic or brain iron deficiency and impaired dopaminergic neurotransmission in the subcortex of the brain. RLS is very responsive to dopaminergic therapies. Rebound of RLS symptoms during the early morning and development of severe symptoms earlier in the day (augmentation) are problematic in those treated for a prolonged period with levodopa.

To compare the Eichhoff's test with a new test, the wrist hyperflexion and abduction of the thumb test, we set up a prospective study over a period of three years for a cohort of 100 patients (88 women, 12 men) presenting spontaneous pain over the radial side of the styloid of the radius (de Quervain tendinopathy). The purpose of the study was to compare the accuracy of the Eichhoff's test and wrist hyperflexion and abduction of the thumb test to diagnose correctly de Quervain's disease by comparing clinical findings using those tests with the results on ultrasound. The wrist hyperflexion and abduction of the thumb test revealed greater sensitivity (0.99) and an improved specificity (0.29) together with a slightly better positive predictive value (0.95) and an improved negative predictive value (0.67). Moreover, the study showed us that the wrist hyperflexion and abduction of the thumb test is very valuable in diagnosing dynamic instability after successful decompression of the first extensor compartment.

We have previously found that sodium nitroprusside (SNP), an NO donor, stimulates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) such as extracellular signal-regulating kinase (ERK), c-jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK, leading to caspase-independent apoptosis in cultured astrocytes. In view of the previous observation that NO stimulates the activity of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX), this study examines the involvement of NCX in cytotoxicity. The specific NCX inhibitor SEA0400 blocked SNP-induced phosphorylation of ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK, and decrease in cell viability. SNP-induced phosphorylation of ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK was blocked by removal of external Ca(2+), and SNP treatment caused an increase in (45)Ca(2+) influx. This increase in (45)Ca(2+) influx was blocked by SEA0400, but not the Ca(2+) channel blocker nifedipine. In addition, SNP-induced (45)Ca(2+) influx and cytotoxicity were reduced in NCX1-deficient cells which were transfected with NCX1 siRNA. Inhibitors of intracellular Ca(2+)-dependent proteins such as calpain and calmodulin blocked SNP-induced ERK phosphorylation and decrease in cell viability. Furthermore, the guanylate cyclase inhibitor LY83583 and the cGMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor KT5823 blocked SNP-induced cytotoxicity.

What would happen if a cell dissolved in water, like sugar does? Obviously, the cell could not survive in such an environment. So something must protect the cell and allow it to survive in its water-based environment. All cells have a barrier around them that separates them from the environment and from other cells. This barrier is called the plasma membrane, or cell membrane. The plasma membrane ( Figure 1.1) is made of a double layer of special lipids, known as phospholipids. The phospholipid is a lipid molecule with a hydrophilic (\"water-loving\") head and two hydrophobic (\"water-hating\") tails. Because of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic nature of the phospholipid, the molecule must be arranged in a specific pattern as only certain parts of the molecule can physically be in contact with water. Remember that there is water outside the cell, and the cytoplasm inside the cell is mostly water as well. So the phospholipids are arranged in a double layer (a bilayer) to keep the cell separate from its environment. Lipids do not mix with water (recall that oil is a lipid), so the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane acts as a barrier, keeping water out of the cell, and keeping the cytoplasm inside the cell. The cell membrane allows the cell to stay structurally intact in its water-based environment. The function of the plasma membrane is to control what goes in and out of the cell. Some molecules can go through the cell membrane to enter and leave the cell, but some cannot. The cell is therefore not completely permeable. \"Permeable\" means that anything can cross a barrier. An open door is completely permeable to anything that wants to enter or exit through the door. The plasma membrane is semipermeable, meaning that some things can enter the cell, and some things cannot. The inside of all cells also contain a jelly-like substance called cytosol. Cytosol is composed of water and other molecules, including enzymes, which are proteins that speed up the cells chemical reactions. Everything in the cell sits in the cytosol, like fruit in a jello mold. The term cytoplasm refers to the cytosol and all of the organelles, the specialized compartments of the cell. The cytoplasm does not include the nucleus. As a prokaryotic cell does not have a nucleus, the DNA is in the cytoplasm.", "output": "the plasma membrane is made of a double layer of __________.", "category": "Question Generation 1097.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage.", "input": "Boris Babacar Diaw-Riffiod, better known as Boris Diaw (born April 16, 1982), is a French professional basketball player for the San Antonio Spurs of the National Basketball Association (NBA).", "output": "What is the name of Boris Diaw's team?", "category": "Question Generation 1097.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage.", "input": "Evaluate efficacy and safety of tanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against nerve growth factor, in neuropathic pain.

That depends. Most teens become physically mature by the age of 16 or so. But they are not adults in a legal sense until they are older. For example, in the U.S., you must be 18 to vote. Once adulthood begins, it can be divided into three stages: (1) early, (2) middle, and (3) late adulthood. Early adulthood starts at age 18 or 21. It continues until the mid-30s. During early adulthood, people are at their physical peak. They are also usually in good health. The ability to have children is greatest during early adulthood, as well. This is the stage of life when most people complete their education. They are likely to begin a career or take a full-time job. Many people also marry and start a family during early adulthood. Middle adulthood begins in the mid-30s. It continues until the mid-60s. During middle adulthood, people start to show signs of aging. Their hair slowly turns gray. Their skin develops wrinkles. The risk of health problems also increases during middle adulthood. For example, heart disease, cancer, and diabetes become more common during this time. This is the stage of life when people are most likely to achieve career goals. Their children also grow up and may leave home during this stage. Late adulthood begins in the mid-60s. It continues until death. This is the stage of life when most people retire from work. They are also likely to reflect on their life. They may focus on their grandchildren. During late adulthood, people are not as physically able. For example, they usually have less muscle and slower reflexes. Their immune system also doesnt work as well as it used to. As a result, they have a harder time fighting diseases like the flu. The risk of developing diseases such as heart disease and cancer continues to rise. Arthritis is also common. In arthritis, joints wear out and become stiff and painful. As many as one in four late adults may develop Alzheimers disease. In this disease, brain changes cause mental abilities to decrease. This family picture shows females in each of the three stages of life. Which stage does each represent? Despite problems such as these, many people remain healthy and active into their 80s or even 90s. Do you want to be one of them? Then adopt a healthy lifestyle now and follow it for life.

Mechanistic understanding of the role of RPS19 in normal erythropoiesis and in the Diamond-Blackfan anemia defect is still poor. However, defective ribosome biogenesis and, in particular, impaired 18S ribosomal RNA maturation have been documented in association with various identified RPS19 mutations. Recently, new genes, all encoding ribosomal proteins, have been found to be mutated in Diamond-Blackfan anemia, adding further support to the concept that ribosome biogenesis plays an important role in regulating erythropoiesis. We previously showed variability in the levels of expression and subcellular localization of a subset of RPS19 mutant proteins. To define the mechanistic basis for this variability better, we studied a large number of mutant proteins and characterized both RPS19 expression level using a specific antibody against RPS19 and RPS19 subcellular localization after transfection of Cos-7 cells with various green fluorescent protein-RPS19 mutants. To investigate the role of the proteasome in RPS19 degradation, we examined the effect of various proteasome inhibitors, namely lactacystin, MG132, and bortezomib on RPS19 expression and subcellular localization We found two distinct classes of RPS19 protein defects in Diamond-Blackfan anemia based on the stability of the mutant proteins: (i) slightly decreased to normal levels of expression and normal nucleolar localization and (ii) markedly deficient expression and failure to localize to the nucleolus. All the proteasome inhibitors tested were able to restore the expression levels and normal subcellular localization of several unstable mutant proteins.

Epidermal growth factor receptor acted as the downstream molecule of SOX4 by way of direct transcriptional control, whereas Slug was the downstream molecule of HIF-1 by way of proteasome-mediated degradation. Analysis of human ovarian tumors further revealed downregulation of miR-138 and upregulation of SOX4 in late-stage tumors. Patients with miR-138(low)/SOX(high) signature are predominant in late stage and tend to have malignant phenotypes including lymph nodes metastasis, larger ascites volume and higher tumor grade.

An ore is a rock that contains minerals with useful elements. Aluminum in bauxite ore (Figure 1.1) is extracted from the ground and refined to be used in aluminum foil and many other products. The cost of creating a product from a mineral depends on how abundant the mineral is and how much the extraction and refining processes cost. Environmental damage from these processes is often not figured into a products cost. It is important to use mineral resources wisely. Geologic processes create and concentrate minerals that are valuable natural resources. Geologists study geological formations and then test the physical and chemical properties of soil and rocks to locate possible ores and determine their size and concentration. A mineral deposit will only be mined if it is profitable. A concentration of minerals is only called an ore deposit if it is profitable to mine. There are many ways to mine ores. Aluminum is made from the aluminum- bearing minerals in bauxite. Surface mining allows extraction of ores that are close to Earths surface. Overlying rock is blasted and the rock that contains the valuable minerals is placed in a truck and taken to a refinery. As pictured in Figure 1.2, surface mining includes open-pit mining and mountaintop removal. Other methods of surface mining include strip mining, placer mining, and dredging. Strip mining is like open pit mining but with material removed along a strip. These different forms of surface mining are methods of extracting ores close to Earths surface. Placers are valuable minerals found in stream gravels. Californias nickname, the Golden State, can be traced back to the discovery of placer deposits of gold in 1848. The gold weathered out of hard metamorphic rock in the western Sierra Nevada, which also contains deposits of copper, lead, zinc, silver, chromite, and other valuable minerals. The Underground mining is used to recover ores that are deeper into Earths surface. Miners blast and tunnel into rock to gain access to the ores. How underground mining is approached from above, below, or sideways depends on the placement of the ore body, its depth, the concentration of ore, and the strength of the surrounding rock. Underground mining is very expensive and dangerous. Fresh air and lights must also be brought into the tunnels for the miners, and accidents are far too common. The ores journey to becoming a useable material is only just beginning when the ore leaves the mine (Figure separated out of the ore. A few methods for extracting ore are: heap leaching: the addition of chemicals, such as cyanide or acid, to remove ore. flotation: the addition of a compound that attaches to the valuable mineral and floats. smelting: roasting rock, causing it to segregate into layers so the mineral can be extracted. To extract the metal from the ore, the rock is melted at a temperature greater than 900o C, which requires a lot of energy.

Below are excerpts from their observations on how studying has changed and how they use libraries. It makes little difference whether the books you are reading is electronic or paper. But if you want a place to read, a library is still the place to go. As a kid in school, I often avoid the study hall noises and go to the quiet school library. The library is a place. A learning place. Modern technology won't change the library as long as things are learned. -Scott Being a student I am aware that many of us seldom look at the books in the library unless told to do so by a teacher as a requirement for an assignment. It takes time to find the very book you want at the library, and it may not be necessary to do so. More and more students, such as myself, use the internet for nearly every assignment. There are countless online resources for us to use with a click of the mouse. What's more, books are very expensive and schools could put that money towards charities. -Hayley H I hope schools continue to have libraries. As a student, I know there is a difference between reading something on a screen and something printed. When I read something in a book that I do not understand or want to look further into. I record it and will research later or discuss with someone. With a screen (especially online) I will instantly access the information and look into the question at hand, which interrupts my reading and especially my imagination. -Allie To me, it depends on the purpose of the books. As a student, I prefer to do research online. Online research is faster and more efficient. But when I'm reading for pleasure, I ly refuse to give up a real book. The tactile sensation and freedom that real books give you really makes the reading experience more enjoyable. So my suggestion is that schools have more digital collections for research and scholarly work, and a good selection of interesting and age-appropriate fiction and nonfiction for pleasure reading. -CM", "output": "Who prefers printed books when reading for fun?", "category": "Question Generation 1097.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage.", "input": "Bone, as well as the lung and liver, is among the sites of predilection for cancer metastasis. The bone stores large amounts of growth factors such as insulin-like growth factors and transforming growth factor-b, and provides fertile soil for metastatic cancer cells by continuously releasing these bone-stored growth factors, which are a consequence of osteoclastic bone resorption. Metastatic cancer cells in turn produce osteoclast-stimulating cytokines such as parathyroid hormone-related protein( PTH-rP), prostaglandin E2.(PGE2), and various interleukins(ILs). These cancer-produced osteoclast-stimulating cytokines bind to their cognitive receptors and promote the expression of ligands for the receptor activators of nuclear factor kB (RANKL)in osteoblasts. RANKL then binds to its receptor RANK, expressed in pre-osteoclasts, stimulates mature osteoclast formation, and subsequently, osteoclastic bone resorption. This vicious cycle between metastatic cancer cells and osteoclasts is critical to the development and progression of bone metastases. In addition, it is likely that metastatic cancer cells are influenced by bone environments(or niche)and acquire additional capacities such as an epithelial-mesenchymal transition(EMT), allowing them to be resistant to chemotherapy or apoptosis, to survive in a dormant state, or to aggressively spread to distant organs including lung and liver. Thus, the bone can serve as transit port. Disrupting this cycle by inhibiting osteoclastic bone resorption, antagonizing bone-derived growth factors, and neutralizing RANKL or PTH-rP, should be a promising therapeutic intervention for bone metastases. Bisphosphonates(BP)are specific inhibitors of osteoclasts, and have been shown to significantly reduce skeletal-related events(SRE)associated with bone metastasis. Denosumab is a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to RANKL and has recently been found to inhibit SRE more effectively than BP. Further understanding of the crosstalk communication between metastatic cancer cells and bone at the molecular level should lead us to design novel, more effective and specific treatments for cancer patients with bone metastases.", "output": "To the ligand of which receptors does Denosumab (Prolia) bind?", "category": "Question Generation 1097.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage.", "input": "Below are some classified ads from the Internet. _ V2 cigs is undeniably the leader in the electronic cigarette industry.

Radioactivity also provides a way to find the absolute age of a rock. First, we need to know about radioactive decay. Some isotopes are radioactive; radioactive isotopes are unstable and spontaneously change by gaining or losing particles. Two types of radioactive decay are relevant to dating Earth materials (Table 1.1): Particle Alpha Composition 2 protons, 2 neutrons Beta 1 electron Effect on Nucleus The nucleus contains two fewer protons and two fewer neutrons. One neutron decays to form a pro- ton and an electron. The electron is emitted. The radioactive decay of a parent isotope (the original element) leads to the formation of stable daughter product, also known as daughter isotope. As time passes, the number of parent isotopes decreases and the number of daughter isotopes increases (Figure 1.1). Radioactive materials decay at known rates, measured as a unit called half-life. The half-life of a radioactive substance is the amount of time it takes for half of the parent atoms to decay. This is how the material decays over time (see Table 1.2). No. of half lives passed 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Percent parent remaining 100 50 25 12.5 6.25 3.125 1.563 0.781 0.391 Percent daughter produced 0 50 75 87.5 93.75 96.875 98.437 99.219 99.609 Pretend you find a rock with 3.125% parent atoms and 96.875% daughter atoms. How many half lives have passed? If the half-life of the parent isotope is 1 year, then how old is the rock? The decay of radioactive materials can be shown with a graph (Figure 1.2). Notice how it doesnt take too many half lives before there is very little parent remaining and most of the isotopes are daughter isotopes. This limits how many half lives can pass before a radioactive element is no longer useful for Decay of an imaginary radioactive sub- stance with a half-life of one year. dating materials.

If both are continental they will smash together and form a mountain range. If at least one is oceanic, it will subduct. A subducting plate creates volcanoes. In the chapter Plate Tectonics we moved up western North America to visit the different types of plate boundaries there. Locations with converging in which at least one plate is oceanic at the boundary have volcanoes. Melting at convergent plate boundaries has many causes. The subducting plate heats up as it sinks into the mantle. Also, water is mixed in with the sediments lying on top of the subducting plate. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material and lowers its melting point. Melting in the mantle above the subducting plate leads to volcanoes within an island or continental arc. Volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries are found all along the Pacific Ocean basin, primarily at the edges of the Pacific, Cocos, and Nazca plates. Trenches mark subduction zones, although only the Aleutian Trench and the Java Trench appear on the map in the previous concept, \"Volcano Characteristics.\" The Cascades are a chain of volcanoes at a convergent boundary where an oceanic plate is subducting beneath a continental plate. Specifically the volcanoes are the result of subduction of the Juan de Fuca, Gorda, and Explorer Plates beneath North America. The volcanoes are located just above where the subducting plate is at the right depth in the mantle for there to be melting (Figure 1.1). The Cascades have been active for 27 million years, although the current peaks are no more than 2 million years old. The volcanoes are far enough north and are in a region where storms are common, so many are covered by glaciers. At divergent plate boundaries hot mantle rock rises into the space where the plates are moving apart. As the hot mantle rock convects upward it rises higher in the mantle. The rock is under lower pressure; this lowers the melting temperature of the rock and so it melts. Lava erupts through long cracks in the ground, or fissures. Volcanoes erupt at mid-ocean ridges, such as the Mid-Atlantic ridge, where seafloor spreading creates new seafloor in the rift valleys. Where a hotspot is located along the ridge, such as at Iceland, volcanoes grow high enough to create islands (Figure 1.3). Eruptions are found at divergent plate boundaries as continents break apart. The volcanoes in Figure 1.4 are in the East African Rift between the African and Arabian plates.

MWS is caused by de novo heterozygous mutations in the ZEB2 gene. The majority of mutations lead to haplo-insufficiency through premature stop codons or large gene deletions. Only three missense mutations have been reported so far; none of which resides in a known functional domain of ZEB2. In this study, we report and analyze the functional consequences of three novel missense mutations, p.Tyr1055Cys, p.Ser1071Pro and p.His1045Arg, identified in the highly conserved C-zinc-finger (C-ZF) domain of ZEB2. Patients' phenotype included the facial gestalt of MWS and moderate ID, but no microcephaly, heart defects or HSCR. In vitro studies showed that all the three mutations prevented binding and repression of the E-cadherin promoter, a characterized ZEB2 target gene. Taking advantage of the zebrafish morphant technology, we performed rescue experiments using wild-type (WT) and mutant human ZEB2 mRNAs. Variable, mutation-dependent, embryo rescue, correlating with the severity of patients' phenotype, was observed. Our data provide evidence that these missense mutations cause a partial loss of function of ZEB2, suggesting that its role is not restricted to repression of E-cadherin. Functional domains other than C-ZF may play a role in early embryonic development. Finally, these findings broaden the clinical spectrum of ZEB2 mutations, indicating that MWS ought to be considered in patients with lesser degrees of ID and a suggestive facial gestalt, even in the absence of congenital malformation.", "output": "Which gene is responsible for the development of the Mowat-Wilson syndrome?", "category": "Question Generation 1097.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage.", "input": "In a few states where racial prejudice is serious, violence has so come to be taken for granted as a means of solving differences, that it is not even questioned. There are states where the white man imposes his rule by force; there are states where the black man protests by setting fire to cities and by looting and pillaging. Important people on both sides, who would in other respects appear to be reasonable men, get up and calmly argue in favor of violence - as if it were a legitimate solution, like any other. What is really frightening, what really fills you with despair, is the realization that when it comes to the crunch, we have made no actual progress at all. We may wear collars and ties instead of war-paint, but our instincts remain basically unchanged. The whole of the recorded history of the human race, that tedious documentation of violence, has taught us absolutely nothing. We have still not learnt that violence never solves a problem but makes it more serious. The sheer horror, the bloodshed, the suffering mean nothing. No solution ever comes to light the morning after when we dismally contemplate the smoking ruins and wonder what hit us. The truly reasonable men who know where the solutions lie are finding it harder and harder to get a hearing. They are despised, mistrusted and even persecuted by their own kind because they advocate such apparently outrageous things as law enforcement. If half the energy that goes into violent acts were put to good use, if our efforts were directed at cleaning up the shabby houses at improving living-standards and providing education and employment for all, we would have gone a long way to arriving at a solution. Our strength is weakened by having to mop up the mess that violence leaves in its wake. In a well-directed effort, it would not be impossible to fulfill the ideals of a stable social programme. The benefits that can be derived from constructive solutions are everywhere apparent in the world around us. Genuine and lasting solutions are always possible, providing we work within the framework of the law. Before we can even begin to reflect on peaceful co-existence between the races, we must appreciate each other's problems. And to do this, we must learn about them: it is a simple exercise in communication, in exchanging information. \"Talk, talk, talk,\" the advocates of violence say, \"all you ever do is talk, and we are none the wiser.\" It's rather like the story of the famous lawyer who carefully explained his case to the judge. After listening to a lengthy argument the judge complained that after all this talk, he was none the wiser. \"Possible, my lord,\" the lawyer replied, \"none the wiser, but surely far better informed.\" Knowledge is the necessary prerequisite to wisdom: the knowledge that violence creates the evils it pretends to solve.", "output": "According the author the best way to solve race prejudice is", "category": "Question Generation 1097.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage.", "input": "Ten years after Fire and Melo's Nobel Prize for discovery of gene silencing by double-stranded RNA, a remarkable progress was achieved in RNA interference (RNAi).

However, the interconnected network of molecules involved in regulating such processes remains elusive. hPaf1/PD2, a subunit of the human PAF-complex, involved in the regulation of transcriptional elongation has oncogenic potential. Our study explores the possibility that regulation of histone methylation by hPaf1 can contribute towards alteration in gene expression by nucleosomal rearrangement. Here, we show that knockdown of hPaf1/PD2 leads to decreased di- and tri-methylation at histone H3 lysine 4 residues in pancreatic cancer cells. Interestingly, hPaf1/PD2 colocalizes with MLL1 (Mixed Lineage Leukemia 1), a histone methyltransferase that methylates H3K4 residues. Also, a reduction in hPaf1 level resulted in reduced MLL1 expression and a corresponding decrease in the level of CHD1 (Chromohelicase DNA-binding protein 1), an ATPase dependent chromatin remodeling enzyme that specifically binds to H3K4 di and trimethyl marks. hPaf1/PD2 was also found to interact and colocalize with CHD1 in both cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of pancreatic cancer cells. Further, reduced level of CHD1 localization in the nucleus in hPaf1/PD2 Knockdown cells could be rescued by ectopic expression of hPaf1/PD2. Micrococcal nuclease digestion showed an altered chromatin structure in hPaf1/PD2-KD cells. Overall, our results suggest that hPaf1/PD2 in association with MLL1 regulates methylation of H3K4 residues, as well as interacts and regulates nuclear shuttling of chromatin remodeling protein CHD1, facilitating its function in pancreatic cancer cells.", "output": "Which is the histone residue methylated by MLL1?", "category": "Question Generation 1097.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage.", "input": "Polar Boy is a fictional character from the 30th century of the DC Universe, initially suggested by reader Buddy Lavigne of Northbrook, Illinois in the letters page of Adventure Comics #304, January, 1963.", "output": "What is the name of the fictional universe that Polar Boy is from?", "category": "Question Generation 1097.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage.", "input": "Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a hereditary cerebrovascular disease leading to accumulating neurologic deficits and dementia.

She explains that she has been planning three years to rescue her fiancee, Bruce Barton, whose airplane crashed in the area. The Governor asks about her colleagues and their reasons for helping.

She responds, \"I couldn't do a thing with the Governor.\" Lee doesn't think there will be any problems. He has a plan for the security escort. They drive out to the landing strip and are met by a policeman (Manuel Lopez). Lee gets in the airplane and starts the engine. It would appear that Marty will stay behind as Russ and Susan board the plane. Marty lures the policeman away from the plane, a Stinson Voyager, and then decks him and boards. The prop wash wakes the policeman and he fires at the departing airplane. The tower calls the plane and orders it to return to the field.

Each type of rock has a distinctive set of minerals. A rock may be made of grains of all one mineral type, such as quartzite. Much more commonly, rocks are made of a mixture of different minerals. Texture is a description of the size, shape, and arrangement of mineral grains. Are the two samples in Figure 1.3 the same rock type? Do they have the same minerals? The same texture? The different colors and textures seen in this rock are caused by the presence of different minerals.

Sample 2 Crystals are tiny or microscopic Magma erupted and cooled quickly Andesite As seen in Table 1.1, these two rocks have the same chemical composition and contain mostly the same minerals, but they do not have the same texture. Sample 1 has visible mineral grains, but Sample 2 has very tiny or invisible grains. The two different textures indicate different histories. Sample 1 is a diorite, a rock that cooled slowly from magma (molten rock) underground. Sample 2 is an andesite, a rock that cooled rapidly from a very similar magma that erupted onto Earths surface. A few rocks are not made of minerals because the material they are made of does not fit the definition of a mineral. Coal, for example, is made of organic material, which is not a mineral.

Apelin, a small regulatory peptide, is the endogenous ligand for the apelin receptor (APJ) receptor. The apelin-APJ signaling system is expressed in rodent and human islet cells. Apelin exposure has been shown to inhibit and to stimulate insulin secretion. Our aim was to assess the influence of a selective APJ deletion in pancreatic islet cells on islet homeostasis and glucose tolerance in mice. Cre-LoxP strategy was utilized to mediate islet APJ deletion. APJ deletion in islet cells (APJ(islet)) resulted in a significantly reduced islet size, density and BCM. An ip glucose tolerance test showed significantly impaired glucose clearance in APJ(islet) mice. APJ(islet) mice were not insulin resistant and in vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was reduced modestly. In vitro glucose-stimulated insulin secretion showed a significantly reduced insulin secretion by islets from APJ(islet) mice. Glucose clearance in response to ip glucose tolerance test in obese APJ(islet) mice fed a chronic high-fat (HF) diet, but not pregnant APJ(islet) mice, was impaired significantly. In addition, the obesity-induced adaptive elevations in mean islet size and fractional islet area were reduced significantly in obese APJ(islet) mice when compared with wild-type mice.

Patients received imatinib after diagnosis and underwent regular laboratory monitoring (quantification of BCR-ABL ratio by RT-PCR). Patients' survival and treatment response were evaluated. Patients' mean age at diagnosis was 40 years (range: 9 to 72 years). Men predominated (17 compared with 7 women). Splenomegaly was found in 80% of cases. The mean leukocyte level was 188.71 g/L (24.4-350). Six patients (24%) had thrombocytosis with a mean platelet count of 491.15 g/L (108-2000). Six patients (24%) died after developing accelerated-phase CML or blast crisis. Estimated overall survival of patients at 6 years was 60%. Molecular biology monitoring detected a secondary G250E mutation with resistance to imatinib in one patient. Standard hematological side effects led to reduction in imatinib doses. The principal nonhematological side effects were weight gain and transient digestible disorders.

In physics, work means the use of force to move an object. The teen who is playing tennis in Figure 16.1 is using force to move her tennis racket, so she is doing work. The teen who is studying isnt moving anything, so she is not doing work. Not all force that is used to move an object does work. For work to be done, the force must be applied in the same direction that the object moves. If a force is applied in a different direction than the object moves, no work is done. Figure 16.2 illustrates this point. The stick person applies an upward force on the box when raising it from the ground to chest height. Work is done because the force is applied in the same direction as the box is moving. However, as the stick person walks from left to right while holding the box at chest height, no more work is done by the persons arms holding the box up. Thats because the force supporting the box acts in a different direction than the box is moving. A small amount of work in the horizontal direction is performed when the person is accelerating during the first step of the walk across the room. But other than that, there is no work, because there is no net force acting on the box horizontally. Work is directly related to both the force applied to an object and the distance the object moves. It can be represented by the equation: Work = Force Distance This equation shows that the greater the force that is used to move an object or the farther the object is moved, the more work that is done. You can see a short video introduction to work as the product of force and distance at this link: . To see the effects of force and distance on work, compare the weight lifters in Figure 16.3. The two weight lifters on the left are lifting the same amount of weight, but the bottom weight lifter is lifting the weight a longer distance. Therefore, this weight lifter is doing more work. The two weight lifters on the bottom right are both lifting the weight the same distance, but the weight lifter on the left is lifting a heavier weight. Therefore, this weight lifter is doing more work. The equation for work given above can be used to calculate the amount of work that is done if force and distance are known. For example, assume that one of the weight lifters in Figure 16.2 lifts a weight of 400 newtons over his head to a height of 2.2 meters off the ground. The amount of work he does is: Work = 400 N 2.2 m = 880 N m Notice that the unit for work is the newton meter. This is the SI unit for work, also called the joule (J). One joule equals the amount of work that is done when 1 newton of force moves an object over a distance of 1 meter. Problem Solving Problem: Todd pushed a 500 N box 4 meters across the floor. How much work did he do? Solution: Use the equation Work = Force Distance. Work = 500 N 4 m = 2000 N m, or 2000 J You Try It! Problem: Lara lifted a 100 N box 1.5 meters above the floor. How much work did she do? Did you ever rake leaves, like the woman in Figure 16.4? It can take a long time to do all that work. But if you use an electric leaf blower, like the man in the figure, the job gets done much sooner. Both the leaf blower and the rake do the work of removing leaves from the yard, but the leaf blower has more power. Thats why it can do the same amount of work in less time. Power is a measure of the amount of work that can be done in a given amount of time. Power can be represented by the equation: Power = Work Time In this equation, work is measured in joules and time is measured in seconds, so power is expressed in joules per second (J/", "output": "use of force to move an object", "category": "Question Generation 1097.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage.", "input": "Tumors of the nervous system most often occur in both children and adults as sporadic events with no family history of the disease, but they are also among the clinical manifestations of a significant number of familial cancer syndromes, including familial retinoblastoma, neurofibromatosis 1 and 2, tuberous sclerosis, and Cowden, Turcot, Li-Fraumeni and nevoid basal cell carcinoma (Gorlin) syndromes. All of these syndromes involve transmissible genetic risk resulting from loss of a functional allele, or inheritance of a structurally defective allele, of a specific gene. These genes include RB1, NF1, NF2, TSC1, TSC2, TP53, PTEN, APC, hMLH1, hPSM2, and PTCH, most of which function as tumor suppressor genes. The same genes are also observed in mutated and inactive forms, or are deleted, in tumor cells in sporadic cases of the same tumors. The nature of the mutational events that give rise to these inactivated alleles suggests a possible role of environmental mutagens in their causation. However, only external ionizing radiation at high doses is clearly established as an environmental cause of brain, nerve and meningeal tumors in humans. Transplacental carcinogenesis studies in rodents and other species emphasize the extraordinary susceptibility of the developing mammalian nervous system to carcinogenesis, but the inverse relationship of latency to dose suggests that low transplacental exposures to genotoxicants are more likely to result in brain tumors late in life, rather than in childhood.

INTERVENTIONS; All patients received supplemental oxygen; endotracheal intubation was performed, and synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation was initiated whenever it was deemed necessary. A peripheral intravenous cannula was inserted, as were indwelling arterial and urinary bladder catheters. Blood pressure, electrocardiogram, respiratory rate, end-tidal CO2, and core temperature were continuously monitored.

These patients had very high serum concentrations of nonbenzodiazepine drugs. Sixty percent of the responders who had primarily ingested benzodiazepines remained awake for 72 +/- 37 mins after flumazenil administration; 40% relapsed into coma after 18 +/- 7 mins and various central nervous system depressant drugs were detected in their blood in addition to benzodiazepines. Seventy-one percent of the patients had ingested tricyclic antidepressants. Seventy-eight percent of the responders were continually and efficaciously treated for < or = 8 days.

The three human brain tissue studies assessing changes in ATP13A2 expression in PD produced divergent results; mRNA is increased while protein levels were observed to be either increased or decreased. This apparent conflict in protein levels might have arisen from examining Lewy body disease cases with coexisting Alzheimer-type pathologies.To assess whether ATP13A2 levels in Lewy body disease are modified by Alzheimer-type -amyloid deposition, we evaluated cases of pure PD and pure dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) for changes in ATP13A2, -synuclein and -amyloid protein levels in cortical regions with and without Lewy bodies. In all Lewy body disease cases, we identified decreased ATP13A2 protein levels that correlated with increases in both -synuclein and -amyloid. Partial colocalization was observed between ATP13A2 and -synuclein in Lewy bodies, whereas ATP13A2 did not colocalize with pathological -amyloid deposition. Our data show that patients with Lewy body diseases have an overall deficit in ATP13A2 protein levels, with the remaining protein being more insoluble and partially redistributing towards Lewy bodies.

The Packers scored touchdowns on all three parts of the team, offense, defense, and special teams. Julius Peppers returned an interception for a touchdown, his second of the year, and Micah Hyde returned a punt for a touchdown. The Packers got going from the very beginning. They drove 75 yards on their opening drive, but had to settle for a 27-yard field goal by Crosby. After an Eagles' punt, the Packers marched on a 13 play, 88-yard drive culminating in a 4-yard touchdown pass to Davante Adams. On the drive, the Packers converted three 3rd-and-longs and took 6:47 off the clock. The Eagles punted again, but this time Micah Hyde returned the punt 75 yards for a touchdown, giving the Packers a shocking 17-0 lead. The Eagles responded on their next possession with a 33-yard field goal by Cody Parkey early in the second quarter. The Eagles, though, had no answer for the Packers' passing game. Rodgers marched the Packers 80 yards in merely 6 plays to increase the lead to 24-3 on a 27-yard touchdown pass to Jordy Nelson. After a punt, the Packers struck again. 80 yards on another time consuming drive ending with Eddie Lacy driving in a 1-yard touchdown run, but a failed two-point conversion. The Eagles reached the Packers' 15, but settled for another 33-yard field goal as the half expired. Mark Sanchez was stripped early in the 3rd quarter with Nick Perry recovering. The Eagles defense finally made a stand and forced a punt, but the Eagles were forced to punt on their responding drive. The Eagles' defense couldn't hold this time and Crosby kicked a 33-yard field goal increasing the lead to 33-6. The Eagles buried themselves on the next drive as Sanchez threw a 52-yard pick-six to Julius Peppers (with a blocked PAT), making the score 39-6. The Eagles immediately answered, driving 80 yards (with a 4th down conversion) with Sanchez throwing a 10-yard touchdown pass to Jordan Matthews. However, the Packers struck right back with an 80yard scoring drive capped off with Rodgers throwing a screen pass to Lacy who took it 32 yards for a touchdown, pushing the lead to 46-13. However, Eagles mishaps continued as Sanchez threw an interception to Tramon Williams, but Crosby missed a field goal. Then on the following drive after reaching the Packers 40, Sanchez fumbled and Hayward returned the fumble 49 yards for a touchdown, making the score a mind boggling 53-13. The Eagles were able to March 80 yards and score on a 20-yard touchdown reception by Jeremy Maclin on their next drive closing the scoring.

Stroke patients commonly have their first contact with medical staff in the emergency room (ER). We designed and validated a stroke recognition tool-the Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale-for use by ER physicians. We prospectively collected data for 1 year (development phase) on the clinical characteristics of patients with suspected acute stroke who were admitted to hospital from the ER. We used logistic regression analysis and clinical reasoning to develop a stroke recognition instrument for application in this setting. Patients with suspected transient ischaemic attack (TIA) with no symptoms or signs when assessed in the ER were excluded from the analysis. The instrument was assessed using the baseline 1-year dataset and then prospectively validated in a new cohort of ER patients admitted over a 9-month period. In the development phase, 343 suspected stroke patients were assessed (159 stroke, 167 non-stroke, 32 with TIA [17 with symptoms when seen in ER]). Common stroke mimics were seizures (23%), syncope (23%), and sepsis (10%). A seven-item (total score from -2 to +5) stroke recognition instrument was constructed on the basis of clinical history (loss of consciousness, convulsive fits) and neurological signs (face, arm, or leg weakness, speech disturbance, visual field defect). When internally validated at a cut-off score greater than zero, the instrument showed a diagnostic sensitivity of 92%, specificity of 86%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 88%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 91%. Prospective validation in 173 consecutive suspected stroke referrals (88 stroke, 59 non-stroke, 26 with TIA [13 with symptoms]) showed sensitivity of 93% (95% CI 89-97), specificity 83% (77-89), PPV 90% (85-95), and NPV 88% (83-93).

Martha announces she has invited a young couple--Nick (George Segal), a young, good-looking, newly appointed instructor, and his mousey wife Honey (Sandy Dennis)--to join them for late-night drinks. George is disturbed because she did so without consulting him first, prompting Martha to launch into the first of many loud and lengthy tirades during which she taunts and criticizes him. Knowing his wife is drunk and quite lewd, he asks her to behave herself when they arrive, and when the doorbell rings, he warns her to refrain from mentioning their child to their company.Overhearing Martha's crude retort as the door opens, Nick and Honey immediately feel ill at ease and quickly find themselves caught in the middle of a verbal war zone when their efforts to engage in small talk set off a volley of insults between their hosts. Martha begins to flirt lewdly with Nick while his meek wife tries to pretend she is unaware of what is happening.While Martha is showing Honey where the bathroom is, George tests Nick's verbal sparring skills, but the young man is no match for his host. Realizing he and his wife are becoming embroiled in the middle of marital warfare, he suggests they depart, but George cajoles him into staying.Upon returning to the living room alone, Honey innocently mentions to George she was unaware he and Martha had a son on the verge of celebrating his 16th birthday. Martha reappears in a new outfit--form-fitting slacks and a revealing blouse--and when her husband makes a snide remark about the ensemble, she begins to demean his abilities as a teacher, then escalates her seduction of Nick, complimenting him on the body he developed as both a quarterback and an intercollegiate state boxing champion while criticizing George's paunch. She informs their guests about a past incident when George refused to engage in a friendly outdoor boxing match with his father-in-law and Martha put on a pair of gloves and punched him in the jaw, knocking him into the bushes. As she relates the story, George aims a shotgun at the back of her head, causing Honey to scream. He pulls the trigger, which releases an umbrella, while he tells his wife she's dead.Honey again raises the subject of George and Martha's son, prompting the couple to engage in a conversation Martha quickly tries to end without success. To counterattack George's relentless comments about the boy, she tells their guests her husband is unsure the child is his own, although he most assuredly is. They argue about the color of the boy's eyes until George threatens to expose the truth about the boy. Furious, Martha accuses him of being a failure whose youthful, idealistic plans for the future slowly deteriorated as he came to realize he wasn't aggressive enough to follow in his father-in-law's footsteps, leaving her stuck with a flop. George cuts the diatribe short by spinning Honey around and mockingly singing, \"Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?\", a joke the shrewed Martha had made herself during the party earlier that evening.Inebriated and on the verge of throwing up from George's spinning, Honey rushes from the room. Martha goes to the kitchen to make coffee, and George and Nick go outside. The younger man confesses he was attracted to Honey more for her family's money than passion, and married her only because she mistakenly believed she was pregnant. George describes his own marriage as one of never-ending accommodation and adjustment, then admits he considers Nick a threat. George also tells a story about a boy he grew up with.

These discoveries determined that the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase is the critical pathogenetic event in CML and an ideal target for therapy. This was confirmed in clinical trials of imatinib, with imatinib significantly improving the long-term survival of patients with CML.

Using serial dilutions of DNAs from lung cancer cell lines harboring either exon 19 or 21 mutations, we detected these mutations in the presence of up to approximately 90% normal DNA. In a test set of 39 lung cancer samples, direct sequencing detected mutations in 25 cases whereas our assays were positive in 29 cases, including 4 cases in which mutations were not apparent by sequencing.

We see ads everywhere (buildings, walls, bus stops, e.t.c) for the hit game Slayers, and how the star character Kable (Gerard Butler) has four battles left before he earns his freedom. We are then shown a battle in progress: a massive shootout inside a factory. Everyone in the game is controlled by players elsewhere. Characters get points for each kill and for saving a teammate. Some characters are shown to be doing menial tasks in the battlefield, seemingly unaware of all the violence around them. 17-year-old Simon (Logan Lerman) plays/controls Kable and leads him around the factory. After slaughtering most everyone in his way, Kable gets blasted outside of the factory. Kable manages to run to the safe point to win the battle. Afterward, the surviving characters are transported elsewhere. The other characters congratulate Kable on winning, since he now only has three battles left until freedom. Some of the other characters don't believe that anyone will be released from the game.The producer (Michael Weston) and Chief of Staff, Bob, (John de Lancie) for the Gina Parker Smith Show discuss their next guest for the show - genius recluse Ken Castle, the creator of Slayers. On the show, Gina (Kyra Sedgwick) talks about the achievements of Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall). He first created a game called Society, which is basically a Sims game but instead of controlling a fake character, the players control a real person and can make them do whatever they want. You can pay to control someone else, or you can get paid to be controlled. Society quickly became extremely popular and profitable, making Castle the richest person in the universe. Nine months ago Castle created Slayers, a controversial game which is supported by the federal government. Castle defends Slayers by stating that each character in the game, though they are real people, are all death row inmates who chose to sign up for the game instead of doing their prison sentence. If a convict can stay alive for thirty battles, they will be set free (though no one has ever survived that long). Some convicts are sent into battlefields with pre-engineered actions to do, and will be set free if they survive just one battle, but are unable to defend themselves (which makes their death rate extremely high). Also, the games are all televised on pay-per-view. Everyone in Slayers and Society has had nano-cells implanted into their brains, which makes it possible for them to be controlled by someone else. They can only be controlled in the perimeter of the game (meaning after the game is over, they get their control back).After the show is over, the signal is hacked into by Humanz, a resistance group. The Humanz Brother (Ludacris) condemns Castle and states that eventually we will all be his slaves if we continue down this road. Castle gets a kick out of it and has his men try to locate where the signal came from. In prison, a convict beats a guard to death and tries to escape but in the end, he fails. Kable sits by himself and thinks about his family. Freek (John Leguizamo) sits next to Kable. He talks about how Kable spooks everyone else when he sits by himself and is constantly thinking. He can't believe that Kable only has three battles left. Freek asks him why he's in prison. Kable has a quick flashback of a man bleeding in a room. Later on, while sitting in his cell, someone opens the slot of the door and hands Kable a picture of his wife and child. The female voice on the other side knows that his family is the only thing he fights for. She makes Kable sign an autograph for her son, David, and then takes a blood sample from his hand as proof of authenticity to increase the value of the autograph.Elsewhere, we see Kable's wife Angie (Amber Valletta) going to work as a character in Society.

This life ended in murder, the victim herself unsure of who her killer was and why she was killed. Her death was only metaphorical, for in her place a new life begins.The story starts with Patience Phillips (Halle Berry), a timid woman who can't stand up for herself. She lets people walk all over her, and has wasted her artistic talent working for a cosmetic company as a graphic designer. George Hedare (Lambert Wilson) runs the company with his supermodel wife, Laurel (Sharon Stone). Laurel knows that Patience is capable, but seems mostly indifferent, only using her in own power struggles with her husband. George, an abusive boss in general, finds plenty of opportunity to mock Laurel.The company is about to launch BeauLine, a new anti-aging product that Laurel had secretly been using for years. The advertisement is designed by Patience but George, unsatisfied, demands that she redesigns it. Upset and frustrated, Patience returns home and sees a cat looking up at her. Shaking her head, she goes to sleep, but her loud neighbours keeps her up and she is unable to rest. Next morning, the cat is on her window ledge. When she approaches, she realizes the cat has climbed up to a higher ledge and was potentially stuck. To try and reach the cat, Patience climbs out her window ledge, and a passing detective mistakens her intentions as suicidal. He ends up rushing into her apartment and pulling her back in. Patience would have thanked him but realizes she is late for work, in her hurry to leave she drops her wallet. The detective, Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt), tracks her down to her workplace and returns it to her, and both agree to a coffee date.Later that night, Patience goes to the production factory to deliver her artwork, and she accidentally hears that the BeauLine has unsafe health problems. Stunned, she backs into several tools, revealling her presence. Two men chase her into a large waste water pipe, where she is trapped, and they flush her into the river, where she drowns. The cat that has been appearing in front of Patience appears by her body and gathers several other cats around her.Patience eventually drags herself unsteadily up and returns home. Her movements are off and uncontrollable, and she ends up breaking the glass through her own window. When her neighbours start their usual loud party again, she yells at them to quiet but they again ignore her. The old Patience would have backed down, but now she strodes down, knocks on their door, and promptly beats up the host and destroys the music equipment in front of many shocked guests. When she wakes up the next morning, she almost dismisses everything as a dream until she sees the broken glass. Unfortunately, her memories of what happened before that are blank, and so she cluelessly returns back to work.At work, George loudly yells at Patience in front of all her coworkers for not handling in her project. She tunes him out, which angers him further, and when she apologizes he only continues. Patience than apologizes for wasting her time in the company, and is fired, but as soon as George leaves her colleagues swarm around her in congratulations. Patience packs up her things and while she and her friends are walking home, two dogs instantly begin barking at her and she instinctively hisses at them. When questioned, she explains her behaviour as allergies. When they pass by a jewelry store, Patience's attention is caught by a beautiful collar-like necklace, but is reminded of her new unemployed status and leaves longingly. Once home, she sees the same cat again, and finally close enough she was able to find the address on the cat's owner.The cat belonged to an older woman named Ophelia, a former professor who lived alone in a house full of cats.

Volcanoes are one type of feature that forms from extrusive rocks. Several other interesting landforms are also extrusive features. Intrusive igneous rocks cool below the surface. These rocks do not always remain hidden. Rocks that formed in the crust are exposed when the rock and sediment that covers them is eroded away. When lava is thick, it flows slowly. If thick lava makes it to the surface, it cannot flow far from the vent. It often stays right in the middle of a crater at the top of a volcano. Here the lava creates a large, round lava dome (Figure A lava plateau is made of a large amount of fluid lava. The lava flows over a large area and cools. This creates a large, flat surface of igneous rock. Lava plateaus may be huge. The Columbia Plateau covers over 161,000 square kilometers (63,000 square miles). It makes up parts of the states of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. Thin, fluid lava created the rock that makes up the entire ocean floor. This is from multiple eruptions from vents at the mid-ocean ridge. While not exactly a lava plateau, its interesting to think about so much lava! New land is created in volcanic eruptions. The Hawaiian Islands are shield volcanoes. These volcanoes formed from fluid lava (Figure 8.21). The island grows as lava is added on the coast. New land may also emerge from lava that erupts from beneath the water. This is one way that new land is created. Magma that cools underground forms intrusions (Figure 8.22). Intrusions become land formations if they are exposed at the surface by erosion. Water works its way through porous rocks or soil. Sometimes this water is heated by nearby magma. If the water makes its way to the surface, it forms a hot spring or a geyser. When hot water gently rises to the surface, it creates a hot spring. A hot spring forms where a crack in the Earth allows water to reach the surface after being heated underground. Many hot springs are used by people as natural hot tubs. Some people believe that hot springs can cure illnesses. Hot springs are found all over the world, even in Antarctica! Geysers are also created by water that is heated beneath the Earths surface. The water may become superheated by magma. It becomes trapped in a narrow passageway. The heat and pressure build as more water is added. When the pressure is too much, the superheated water bursts out onto the surface. This is a geyser. There are only a few areas in the world where the conditions are right for the formation of geysers. Only about 1,000 geysers exist worldwide. About half of them are in the United States. The most famous geyser is Old Faithful at Yellowstone National Park (Figure 8.23). It is rare for a geyser to erupt so regularly, which is why Old Faithful is famous.", "output": "hot water that seeps out of a crack at the surface", "category": "Question Generation 1097.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a context passage, generate a question from the passage such that its answer is shortest continous span from the passage.", "input": "We show that overexpression of Polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4) in human cells induces centrosome amplification through the simultaneous generation of multiple procentrioles adjoining each parental centriole.

Plk4, hSas-6, CPAP, Cep135, gamma-tubulin, and CP110 were required at different stages of procentriole formation and in association with different centriolar structures. Remarkably, hSas-6 associated only transiently with nascent procentrioles, whereas Cep135 and CPAP formed a core structure within the proximal lumen of both parental and nascent centrioles. Finally, CP110 was recruited early and then associated with the growing distal tips, indicating that centrioles elongate through insertion of alpha-/beta-tubulin underneath a CP110 cap.

The photo in Figure 17.8 represents six of the eight different forms of energy that are described in this lesson. The guitarist gets the energy he needs to perform from chemical energy in food. He uses mechanical energy to pluck the strings of the guitar. The stage lights use electrical energy and give off both light energy and thermal energy, commonly called heat. The guitar also uses electrical energy, and it produces sound energy when the guitarist plucks the strings. For an introduction to all these forms of energy, go to this URL: . For an interactive animation about the different forms of energy, visit this URL: After you read below about different forms of energy, you can check your knowledge by doing the drag and drop quiz at this URL: . Mechanical energy is the energy of an object that is moving or has the potential to move. It is the sum of an objects kinetic and potential energy. In Figure 17.9, the basketball has mechanical energy because it is moving. The arrow in the same figure has mechanical energy because it has the potential to move due to the elasticity of the bow. What are some other examples of mechanical energy? Energy is stored in the bonds between atoms that make up compounds. This energy is called chemical energy, and it is a form of potential energy. If the bonds between atoms are broken, the energy is released and can do work. The wood in the fireplace in Figure 17.10 has chemical energy. The energy is released as thermal energy when the wood burns. People and many other living things meet their energy needs with chemical energy stored in food. When food molecules are broken down, the energy is released and may be used to do work. Electrons are negatively charged particles in atoms. Moving electrons have a form of kinetic energy called electrical energy. If youve ever experienced an electric outage, then you know how hard it is to get by without electrical energy. Most of the electrical energy we use is produced by power plants and arrives in our homes through wires. Two other sources of electrical energy are pictured in Figure 17.11. The nuclei of atoms are held together by powerful forces. This gives them a tremendous amount of stored energy, called nuclear energy. The energy can be released and used to do work. This happens in nuclear power plants when nuclei fission, or split apart. It also happens in the sun and other stars when nuclei fuse, or join together. Some of the suns energy travels to Earth, where it warms the planet and provides the energy for photosynthesis (see Figure The atoms that make up matter are in constant motion, so they have kinetic energy. All that motion gives matter thermal energy. Thermal energy is defined as the total kinetic energy of all the atoms that make up an object. It depends on how fast the atoms are moving and how many atoms the object has. Therefore, an object with more mass has greater thermal energy than an object with less mass, even if their individual atoms are moving at the same speed. You can see an example of this in Figure 17.13. Energy that the sun and other stars release into space is called electromagnetic energy. This form of energy travels through space as electrical and magnetic waves. Electromagnetic energy is commonly called light. It includes visible light, as well as radio waves, microwaves, and X rays (Figure 17.14). The drummer in Figure 17.15 is hitting the drumheads with drumsticks. This causes the drumheads to vibrate. The vibrations pass to surrounding air particles and then from one air particle to another in a wave of energy called sound energy. We hear sound when the sound waves reach our ears. Sound energy can travel through air, water, and other substances, but not through empty space. Thats because the energy needs particles of matter to pass it on. Energy often changes from one form to another. For example, the mechanical energy of a moving drumstick changes to sound energy when it strikes the drumhead and causes it to vibrate.
