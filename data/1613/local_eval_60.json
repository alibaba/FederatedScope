The drum beat that opened  Taylor Swift \u00e2\u0080\u0099s 1989 made a slow  simple  statement: \u00e2\u0080\u009c1 \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 2 \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 3 \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and 4!\u00e2\u0080\u009d at a pace roughly appropriate for lurching along in a grocery line  with a regularity that even the most drunken campfire-side clapper couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mess up. The song  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWelcome to New York \u00e2\u0080\u009d kicked off her supposed first \u00e2\u0080\u009cofficial pop album\u00e2\u0080\u009d with a portrait of glorious naivety.  Swift  was the country girl just arrived in the big city  amazed by all  she  saw: the lights  the sounds  the homosexuals.  Her  gait was accordingly untroubled  steady  optimistic: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a new soundtrack / I could dance to this beat forevermore.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe album that followed largely stayed in that shiny  straightforward mode.  She  was open-hearted yet unflappable  whether brushing off criticism (\u00e2\u0080\u009cShake It Off\u00e2\u0080\u009d)  lightly dressing the wounds of breakups (\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll You Had to Do Was Stay\u00e2\u0080\u009d)  or memorializing the thrill of a new relationship (\u00e2\u0080\u009cOut of the Woods\u00e2\u0080\u009d). Slabs of synth and driving  steady beats cast a movie-trailer glow of enchantment. Reviewers noted that this mode actually broke from recent pop trends  spurning the influence of hip-hop and R&B  as well as some of the grim moodiness creeping onto the charts. The video for \u00e2\u0080\u009cShake It Off\u00e2\u0080\u009d even poked fun at the idea that  Swift  might start imitating Nicki Minaj like some of her contemporaries.\nTwo songs didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite fit that pattern  though. One was \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlank Space \u00e2\u0080\u009d a masterwork of hip-hop-adjacent sarcasm. The legendary pop producers Max Martin and Shellback threaded together a high  whistling harmony and kick-drum/snare pattern over which  Swift  sneered rapid clusters of syllables about being a man-eater. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBad Blood \u00e2\u0080\u009d too  waged war in what sounded like a personal feud over modern jock-jam thump. It got an extra layer of syncopation for the Kendrick Lamar remix that  like \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlank Space \u00e2\u0080\u009d enjoyed a run at No. 1 on the Hot 100.\nThe rumors about the recording sessions for  Swift \u00e2\u0080\u0099s forthcoming album Reputation were that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d see her  finally  diving into hip-hop and R&B. Those reports drew immediate skepticism  as it was hard to imagine how such a change might work for  Swift  without  her  seeming ridiculous. But it now appears the rumors were true  though the question of ridiculousness hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite gone away. Where 1989 was sleek and stiff and retro  Reputation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s songs so far have been busier  choppier  and decidedly modern\u00e2\u0080\u0094which is to say  rap-influenced.

The Dec. 12 special Senate election in Alabama is being touted as the next clash in the ongoing battle between  Steve Bannon  and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for the soul of the Republican Party\u00e2\u0080\u0094what  Bannon   with characteristic hyperbole  calls a \u00e2\u0080\u009cseason of war.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Roy Moore  the GOP candidate  stands accused of numerous incidents of sexual misconduct  including allegations that he molested a 14-year-old girl. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prompted McConnell  a Kentucky Republican  and most of his GOP colleagues to disavow him.  Bannon   by contrast  was Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most important ally in the wake of the sex scandal  at least until President Donald Trump took to Twitter to weigh in on Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behalf.\nMcConnell knows that having an accused child molester in the Senate would be toxic for his party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s image  and that Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stubborn recklessness would make his own job next to impossible. For  Bannon   one suspects  this is the whole source of Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appeal.\nBannon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stated rationale for backing Moore is that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help carry out the populist revolt that the former White House chief strategist is attempting to lead against McConnell and the GOP establishment. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an odd claim to make  since Moore is less of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpopulist\u00e2\u0080\u009d than a \u00e2\u0080\u009ctheocrat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He was twice kicked off the Alabama Supreme Court  once for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument  the other time for refusing to grant marriage licenses to gay couples. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more   Bannon  has a more powerful weapon to deploy that really does align with  his  professed politics and would all but ruin McConnell:  He  could oppose the Republican tax plan.\n Bannon  rose to prominence by espousing a brand of Republican politics that differed sharply from what party leaders such as McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan were pushing. Instead of tax cuts for the wealthy and slashed entitlement spending   Bannon  thought the GOP should become a \u00e2\u0080\u009cworkers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 party\u00e2\u0080\u009d focused on strengthening the middle class. This idea was so popular with conservative voters that when Trump took it up  he won the Republican presidential nomination. It also helped  him  steal blue-collar voters from Hillary Clinton in the general election.\nSince  his  inauguration  however  Trump has consistently deferred to the same Republican leaders whose priorities  he  exposed as being out of step with the rest of the country. Nothing illustrates this better than the tax plan McConnell and his allies are frantically trying to rush through the Senate.\nIn sum  the GOP tax plan makes a mockery of what  Bannon  and  his  followers claim to stand for by directing its major benefits to the kind of plutocrats who donate to McConnell and his Republican colleagues\u00e2\u0080\u0094one reason the plan is deeply unpopular with most voters. A recent ABC News poll found that 60 percent of Americans think the plan favors the wealthy  and just one in three support it.\nSo far  Bannon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s populist revolt has met with only middling success. Although he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pledged to run insurgents in 2018 against every GOP incumbent but Ted Cruz  a strong slate of candidates has yet to emerge. One place  Bannon  has succeeded  though  is in tarnishing McConnell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s image among Republicans. Polls consistently show the majority leader to be the least popular member of the Senate  and an Oct. 24 Harvard-Harris poll found that most Republicans wish  he  would resign. If McConnell can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pass a tax bill  he may have to.\nGiven this vulnerability   Bannon  could use his influence and platform at Breitbart News to highlight the plutocratic skew of the GOP plan and demand that its spoils be redirected to the ordinary workers who elected Trump. Calling on Republicans to swap out the estate tax repeal  carried interest breaks and cuts for millionaires for  say  a payroll tax cut aimed squarely at the middle class would put McConnell in an impossible bind  while providing  Bannon  the dual benefits of being broadly popular and entirely consistent with  his  and Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2016 campaign message.\nInstead   Bannon  has been raging at McConnell without doing much to inhibit his agenda. He may yet carry Moore to victory. But if McConnell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tax plan becomes law  there\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be little doubt as to who is the true victor.", "output": "yes", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1051.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity.

When dinner came on the flight  Dave pulled out his BlackBerry and snapped a picture of the bag of McDonald\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hamburgers and unopened package of Oreo cookies and emailed it to Susan.\nOn Trump Force One there were four major food groups: McDonald\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  Kentucky Fried Chicken  pizza  and Diet Coke. There were also ancillary groups  including Vienna Fingers and the ubiquitous Oreo  before the boycott (after it was Hydrox). The reason the package of Oreos was unopened was because  Mr. Trump  would never eat from a previously opened package. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen the Seinfeld episode in which George double-dips  his  chip  you have a pretty good idea of the boss\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reasoning. Packages of cookies  along with small airliner-size bags of pretzels and potato chips  filled the plane\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cupboards. An army might march on its stomach  but Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team flew on junk food. And those snacks would have to sustain us during long flights and even longer days.\nThe candidate would hardly ever eat lunch and would eat dinner only after he finished the last event of the day. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be in the jet or on the road from seven or eight a.m.  make however many scheduled stops we had  and after the last one  perhaps around nine p.m.   Mr. Trump  would clap  his  hands and say  \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d And the food needed to be hot and ready for  him . Some of the time  especially when  he  was pleased with  his  performance at a rally or event   he \u00e2\u0080\u0099d say  \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you think I deserve a malted today? I think I deserve one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Trump   a city kid  grew up drinking malteds  so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what he always called a milkshake. Whatever you want to call it  it better be there and it better still be thick.\nWhen traveling in the air with the boss  you also learned pretty quickly to like Elton John.  Donald Trump  really likes Elton John. Anthony \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Mooch\u00e2\u0080\u009d Scaramucci got in all sorts of hot water\u00e2\u0080\u0094which is not at all an unfamiliar position for him\u00e2\u0080\u0094when he told an interviewer that Elton John would play at President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inaugural. It had been wishful thinking on Mooch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part  probably because he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been on the plane when the boss had \u00e2\u0080\u009cTiny Dancer\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cRocket Man\u00e2\u0080\u009d playing as loud as the concert-level speakers could bring it. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re telling you  when the boss cranks up Elton  you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hear yourself think.

He  was then sentenced to 12 months in custody before being given a bad conduct discharge.\nA 1968 Gun Control Act made it unlawful for a licensed firearms dealer to sell a weapon to any person who is given a dishonorable discharge. But because  Kelley  was discharged on bad conduct  the law was not triggered  Adam Winkler  a professor of law and a specialist in American constitutional law at the University of California at Los Angeles  told Fox News on Monday.\n Kelley  purchased two firearms from two separate Academy Sports + Outdoors stores in San Antonio in 2016 and 2017  respectively  the sporting goods store confirmed to Fox News in a statement on Monday.

No  it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a strategy to protect Londoners from potential terrorist attacks at public festivals this Christmas season.

(Nearly 40 percent of children in London are overweight or obese by the time they finish grade school  and the number of obese eleven-year-olds in the city spiked by 22 percent in the last four years.)\nThe mayor is also asking restaurants to make food healthier by using fewer villainous ingredients  and grilling or baking food items instead of frying them: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Healthier Catering Commitment is a scheme that helps food businesses in London to provide healthier food to their customers. The scheme promotes a reduction in the consumption of fat  salt and sugar  and an increase in access to fruit and vegetables.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (To  his  credit   Khan  is reportedly trying to stop the number of pubs closing in the city each year.

Business owners  who are usually smarter than politicians  figured out a way around the rules by opening smaller food stores or restaurants with limited seating.

She  said  Franken  had forcibly kissed  her  during a 2006 USO war zone tour  and a photo showed him with his hands over  her  chest while  she  was sleeping.\nFour days later  a woman named Lindsay Menz told CNN that  Franken  had touched  her  buttocks while the two were being photographed in 2010 at the Minnesota State Fair.\n Franken  has apologized to Tweeden  and has said  he  does not remember the incident with Menz. Last week  two other women told the Huffington Post Franken had touched their buttocks in separate incidents. The article did not provide the names of those two accusers.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember these photographs  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0098t \u00e2\u0080\u009d  Franken  told the Star Tribune. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is not something I would intentionally do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have been reflecting on this \u00e2\u0080\u009d  Franken  told Minnesota Public Radio of the allegations. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to be a better man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Franken  is among a long list of celebrities and politicians who have been accused of sexual misconduct.

Representatives of President Bashar al-Assad's government -- who have trooped through many of Geneva's fine hotels -- have never even met face-to-face with Syria's opposition.\nYes  we have been here before. But this time it feels different. Russia is calling almost all the shots  making an outcome in  Assad 's favor much closer.\nIndeed  the opposition has in the past insisted  Assad  must go almost as a precondition for talks rather than an outcome of the peace process itself. And where Obama supported this position  Trump is reversing from it.\nIn late October  US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said: \"The only thing that changed is when this administration came into office  we took a view that it is not a prerequisite that  Assad  go before that process starts; rather  the mechanism by which  Assad  departs will likely emerge from that process.\"\nBut as we approach this latest round of talks   Assad  seemed to be leveraging Trump's implicit support  delaying  his  delegation's arrival at the talks  pushing back against opposition demands  he  needs to go early in the talks process and not be part of a transitional government.\nAs the US bows out   Assad  appears empowered and the UN mediator weakened. On the eve of talks  he  issued a statement demanding no preconditions from either side.\nRussia and the US agree to do all they can to reach a compromise -- Russia with  Assad ; the US with the opposition.\nYet each time talks collapse because  Assad 's forces ratchet up their offensives and sieges.\nThe opposition  not unreasonably  says it can't negotiate while its people are being starved and killed. Mediators call for pauses in the talks that can drag out for months. The pause then only ends when  Assad  wins whatever battle  he 'd used to stall the talks.\nOn the eve of these talks  Eastern Ghouta -- a suburb of Damascus -- is in the headlines. It is the latest pocket of opposition  Assad  is trying to extinguish. International observers will be watching carefully  albeit with no clout to change the dynamic  should  he  use the cover of these talks to accelerate attacks here.\nEach time has  Assad  crashed the talks previously  Russia -- rather than convince  him  to stop -- has helped provide cover for  him .\nThat was Obama's understanding with Putin. The US believed Russia would do as it said it would -- namely  telling  Assad  to stop fighting -- and negotiate in good faith. It never happened.\nWhen finally Russia did vote for UN Security Council Resolution 2254   calling for a political  not military solution and setting a time frame and process for  Assad  to end the war and transition from power  it seemed impossible the Russians could weasel out of their obligations again. Yet they did.\nFor any democratic leader  victory at the cost Syria has paid -- hundreds of thousands dead  more than half the population displaced  and close to 5 million refugees forced to flee the country -- would be pyrrhic in the extreme. But not for  Assad  and  his  ally Vladimir Putin.\nHow different things are now. As parties get ready to arrive in Geneva  Putin recently held a meeting with all the key powers in the region and beyond  which was notable for  Assad 's presence outside Syria for the first time in seven years.\nThat a man as paranoid as  Assad  could be lured from his safe Damascus lair is an indication of the influence Putin holds over him.", "output": "yes", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1051.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity.

Washington (CNN) On Thursday night in New Hampshire  former Trump White House chief strategist Steve Bannon offered a simple explanation for the bombshell report in The Washington Post that  Alabama Republican Senate nominee Roy Moore  pursued sexual relationships with four teenagers when  he  was in  his  early 30s.\n\"The Bezos Amazon Washington Post that dropped that dime on Donald Trump is the same Bezos Amazon Washington Post that dropped the dime this afternoon on Judge Roy Moore \" Bannon said . \"Now is that a coincidence? That's what I mean when I say opposition party  right?\"\nIt's an echo of what Moore himself said after the Post story went live: \"The Washington Post has already endorsed the judge's opponent  and for months  they have engaged in a systematic campaign to distort the truth about the judge's record and career and derail his campaign \" read the statement in part . (The Post's editorial board endorsed Doug Jones    Moore 's Democratic opponent. The newsgathering end of the organization has zero interaction with the editorial board.)\nIt's easy for Bannon (or  Moore ) to make the \"fake news hates conservatives\" argument. Hardcore conservatives will believe it. Because they hate the media.\nUsing Bannon's logic that the whole  Moore  story was cooked up by the media to get  Moore   you must also believe the following things:\n* The Post convinced four women  who were willing to put their names forward publicly and risk the scrutiny that comes with that decision  to lie about their interactions with  Moore  when they were teenagers. The Post was able to do this despite the fact that the four women did not know one another. And they did not reach out to the Post in an effort to get their stories told.\n* These women created detailed stories about how they met  Moore   where  he  took them on dates and how  he  sought to make the relationship more romantic or sexual.\n* That these women were motivated by political dislike for  Moore  (or Republicans) to make up these tales. (Worth noting: Leigh Corfman  the woman at the center of The Post story  voted for the Republican nominee in each of the last three elections -- including for Trump in 2016.) Or that they were paid somehow to do it. Or they just lied to lie. Or something.\n* More than two dozen other people who helped corroborate the Post story were also in on this ruse. (The Post said it interviewed more than 30 people who said they knew  Moore  between 1977 and 1982  which is when these episodes allegedly took place.) That's a whole lot of people to organize into a grand scheme to lie about  Moore 's sexual misconduct.\nAgain  if you believe Bannon  go back and read what I wrote above. Because if you believe that this is all a targeted effort to take out  Moore  because of  his  beliefs  you need to believe all of the rest of that stuff is true too.", "output": "no", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1051.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity.
