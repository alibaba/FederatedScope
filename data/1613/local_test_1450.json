My mom and I have never fully gotten along but lately it\u2019s gotten so much worse. She\u2019s one of those people who always has to have it worse than you and is always right. My dad just puts up with it to keep the peace and I did for a long time too until recently. I started going to therapy for my depression and my therapist said that when she starts to cause problems I should not be afraid to stick up for myself. I have a problem with letting people walk all over me and my therapist knows this.\n\nDespite all that I know my mom loves me but sometimes I think she does things just to keep me on a leash. I pay my own car bill but that\u2019s it. My parents handle the insurance and my phone bill. I\u2019ve offered to at least pick up my phone bill since it\u2019s only about $30 a month and I\u2019m trying to get my credit score up either way but she always says no and turns it into a fight about how I\u2019m ungrateful and such.\n\n\nI\u2019m not exactly a neat person. When I\u2019m in a better mental state my bedroom tends to be neat but when I\u2019m feeling depressed it kinda goes to shit. I\u2019ve tried to keep it clean but my motivation to do so always just kinda vanishes after awhile. My parents HATE this. They will undermine everything I\u2019ve ever accomplished if my room isn\u2019t clean. For example, I just got a part time job teaching private voice and piano, something that is very difficult to do without a degree of some kind. I told my parents and they didn\u2019t care at all because my laundry wasn\u2019t done. They\u2019ll also take any fight my mom and I have and spin it back on me because my room isn\u2019t clean, even if it has nothing to do with that. For example, my mom one time saw me wearing a bikini, poked my stomach and said \n\n\u201cMmmm Pasta?\u201d\n\nMind you I\u2019m very self conscious about my weight and struggled with bulimia for awhile. I stormed out of the house and went crying to the beach only to get a text ten minutes later \u201cWell maybe if your room was clean...\u201d\n\nWell the other day I was fighting with my mom (again) because I said I was looking into apartments. I had told her I want to move in with a friend because I think not living together would help our relationship more and give me the space I need. She started crying and screaming about how I was \u201cso ungrateful\u201d and \u201cnot ready for the real world.\u201d \n\nI\u2019d had enough and that point and told her I wanted out because she has no idea how to treat anyone with any sort of respect, let alone her own daughter. I essentially just went off and she went to work crying. \n\nI feel bad, I do love her and all, but I\u2019m so sick and tired of all the bs. I know I should keep my room clean but when I tried to explain why I don\u2019t with all my mental health problems I was just called a \u201csnowflake millennial\u201d and told my disorders were fake. Meanwhile my mom sits there and preaches that she has BPD when she\u2019s yet to be diagnosed.\n\nAm I the asshole?

I've been with my girlfriend for almost a year now and there have been a string of issues that make me feel like or relationship will only ever be temporary.  This is mostly due to her sexual views which contrast mine.  She is much more open to sex but stays monogamous to me since I am less liberal about it.  She has made clear though that if we are separated, she still needs physical contact.  Which brings me to the incident...\n\nLast summer we were separated for 2 months due to working in different places.  We agreed before hand that if she did anything with someone else, we would follow boundaries and she'd tell me beforehand.  She did not do anything for 7 weeks but then at a party, she got cuddly with a co-worker and they ended up exchanging oral.  Pretty much they cuddled, he fingered her and she blew him.  Though this bothered me immensely, what hurt me the most was that I was trying to contact her through the party and she never responded until afterwards when she told me she did this with another guy.  It was honestly the worst I've ever felt.\n\nWe talked about it and she claimed she didn't consider it sex so she didn't know she should have checked up with me.  But what bothered me was she was outright ignoring me and I saw it as an act of cheating.  However I buried these insecurities and have been with her for another 4 months with no problems.\n\nBut I still think about this a lot and I could never see myself spending my life with her because of it.  There's a chance we'll be separated again this summer and I am wondering if it would be an asshole move to give her the option of staying 100% monogamous or breaking up.  Maybe I'm looking for more general advice but I could only think of this sub.  Thanks for the feedback.\n\nTLDR: girlfriend did something id consider cheating.

We are both young and in post-secondary school so that is a long way off. We get along very well for the most part. We often talk about marriage and kids and our future. \n\nWhen it comes to wedding rings, I hate the idea and the tradition. The absurdity and immorality of the diamond industry and how it became a tradition from tricky marketing makes me sick. I feel that many men feel that they HAVE to buy an expensive rock to show their love but that is absurd. IMO buying an expensive diamond ring means I'm buying into everything about the industry that disgusts me. \n\nMy SO desires a nice wedding ring, and it has been a dream of hers for a long time. Bringing up my distaste for the tradition always leads to an awkward fight, and now we cant talk about it at all without her saying she doesn't want to talk about it. She knows very shallowly from my rantings about the industry, but she doesn't care enough to not want one. \n\nI have talked about the idea of synthetic diamonds, but she is not interested and wants the real deal. She has came back and said she would be fine with synthetic for the band, but she wants a decent sized real diamond in the middle, something around the 2k to 4k range. This boggles my mind as that money could be a downpayment on a house, kids college money, exploring the world, etc. Why waste it on a little rock that I morally do not agree with? \n\nI'm not asking anyone to put down my GFs beliefs as I know a lot of people has distaste with diamonds. I get where she is coming from, a lot of girls dream of the real deal fancy ring their man will get them one day. I just choke up thinking about actually putting that cash on a single ring. \n\nAITA for not wanting to ever waste money on an expensive diamond wedding ring? I would do anything for this girl, but just giving up and doing the deed only confirms my thoughts that men are trapped into buying into a shitty industry.

After 2 or 3 weeks of geting to know her, I asked her out. Only, I made the mistake of asking her to \"hang out\" instead of explicitly asking her on a date. She said yes, but the next day I found out that she did have a BF. I thought \"that's fine, she's a cool person and I like having friends.\" We didn't hang out, though, and I never persued hanging out with her outside of work again. I did feel like I had caught a bit of the feely feels, but I figured I'd get over it and things would be kosher. I know a lot of women who I value as friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut we did talk a lot. Our positions at work caused us to spend a lot of time together talking alone. The more I got to know her, the more and more it became obvious that we had some pretty bonkers stuff in common. Tons of stuff in common.

I fell for her pretty hard, and I was in way over my head emotionally before I realized it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually, she left that job, but we kept in touch over FB messenger pretty often. My feelings grew to the point where I just couldn't get her out of my head. I became very, very depressed and started seeing a therapist for the first time in a long time. It highlighted the fact that I depend too much on others for happiness. I felt like I had to disconnect from her, and that there was no way for us to be friends without it being a toxic, one-sided thing. I didn't want to feel like I was leading her on in a friendship way for too long, and I felt like it would be best for both of us if we weren't friends while I tried to work on my co-dependency issues and my obsession with her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince she was already involved with someone and she seemed happy with what she was doing on that end, I didn't want to tell her about my feelings.

I felt like she was owed an explination, but I didn't think I should tell her about my feelings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut one day, she texted me, agressively asking for an explination. I told her that I had very strong feelings for her, and that it was probably best for both of us if we weren't friends.

Then she blocked me on all social media platforms that we followed each other on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was a month ago, and I am crushed.

We are both 18 now and about to graduate. A few months back she got a job at a department store and met a guy who would text her nonstop at all hours. I never gave it much thought until she got angry and defensive after I asked for her phone password while she was driving to change the song on Spotify. I asked her if it had anything to do with this guy from work, and got the \"you shouldn't worry about him\" talk in return. \n\n\n\n\nFast forward to this past weekend, I drove us down to San Diego just to hang out, which is give or take 2 hours away from our area. Everything had been going great all day, and we were waiting to order in a Denny's when she got all serious and dropped the absolute shocker of a lifetime. That guy wasn't just a friend, but she was *going to* cut him off after feeling super duper guilty, poor her. Iwas obviously still hurt, but mostly I was just pissed, so I stormed off, got in my car, and left her there.\n\n\n\n\nI pulled over a few miles away and she was blowing up my phone, apologizing, cussing me out, etc. In the middle of it all she did manage to tell me I had to come back and get her. I started to feel really guilty. She had her phone and wallet and all, but at this point with traffic, it would be around 3 hours before anyone would make it out to her. I didn't even know if her mom or sister were at work or not and able to go get her.  I gave thought to turning back, but eventually angrily texted her back to make her co-worker come get her.\n\n\n\n\nAnyways I still feel pretty shitty about the whole thing, in the moment I just couldn't fathom being in a car with her for hours listening to excuses. I've asked a few friends about this and have gotten really mixed responses about if I was in the wrong here.

She is the loud, sometimes obnoxious, attention loving performer-type and I, the goofy, introverted hermit, emotional artist-type. \n\nThe dynamic of our relationship has always been that I'm there for her whenever she needed me and if she was struggling with something, I was happy to spend however long talking her through it. I'm assuming with as much as I've done for her and helped her out in the past, she felt like she could rely on me. But, it wasn't so much the same for me. See, most of our conversations would always somehow end up focusing on her, even if it was something \\*I\\* wanted to talk about. Still, I considered her as my best friend and even an extended family member for all the events/family dinners she's been at.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, fast forward...I leave our hometown, move across country a few times, get married. She stays back home, pretty much doing/living the same life before I left. We halfassedly keep in touch while I'm away, and we even organize double dates/hangouts when I'm back home. But, over time, keeping in touch becomes more and more difficult and there's resentment compounding on my end for ridiculously stupid things like \"she never likes my pictures on instagram\", \"she didn't message to ask if I was ok when she saw I was in the hospital\", \"I'm always the one saying hello and she takes forever to respond to texts, yet she hits me up when she needs help with something\", etc...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo eventually, I got sick and tired of her shit and sent her this text;\n\n \n\nHey dude,\n\nJust wanted to reach out to apologize for being in town for over a week and not getting in touch. To be honest, I\u2019ve been kind of upset over the past few weeks and I got to a point where I thought it would be best not to reach out. It hit me some time later that letting anger get in the way of honest expression is the reason why most friendships wither and die over time. So my idea in being completely honest with you here is so that I have a chance to get it off my chest, give the situation an opportunity to unveil all of the hundreds of other possibilities my one perspective might be missing, and most importantly give this friendship another chance to survive. \n\nI want to be super clear that while this message may seem one sided - it\u2019s just me expressing everything I feel. And, what I feel is all I know. I fully open the possibility of being completely wrong and having misunderstood things. Ultimately, I\u2019m reaching out because I\u2019m not comfortable in making my own assumptions of the truth to a two sided story. How could I possibly?\n\nAnyway, for as long as I\u2019ve been capable, I\u2019ve always done my best to help you. I answered your call when I was on vacation to walk you through Instagram marketing, set up your YouTube ad campaign over the holidays, and have never hesitated to share with you anything and everything I\u2019m doing that has helped me - in order to help you. I never expected anything in return because that\u2019s not why I chose to help. I helped because I thought we had a mutual respect and care for one another as friends and as independent artists. But every time I reached out to say hello, I\u2019d never get a response, and when I did it was super delayed and the excuse was always the same. I became extremely ill right around your birthday but I messaged to wish you a happy birthday but you didn\u2019t respond until a week later, after you saw that I was in the hospital. By the end of all that - you reached out to ask me what happened, I was so tired of not being responded to, that I answered in a way to cut the conversation to avoid waiting for a response that would never come. That made me so sad. And made me wonder if you really cared. \n\nSo, ultimately it was time to go back home for a visit and I was extremely resentful towards you. To me, it feels like I\u2019ve inserted many coins in this friendship vending machine only to feel like I\u2019ve just come up short. You may have noticed that I didn\u2019t mention being busy as an excuse I\u2019m interested in talking about. I know how busy I am and I\u2019m assuming your schedule is no different. \n\nIn all honesty, I wasn\u2019t going to send this at until I played this 30 min exercise / game and it opened my eyes to why I should. (do it on desktop browser to fully understand what I\u2019m talking about). \n\nWhatever happens I feel good about being honest with you. Life\u2019s too short to be angry and I don\u2019t want to keep thinking about it. I will always love you.\n\n\\----------\n\nShe responded by saying she needed time to think things through and that she loved me and respected me...but then turned around to unfriend/unfollow me and she hasn't bothered to reach out like she lead me to believe she would. I feel hurt and used obviously, but the question that wracks my brain constantly is this...Am I an asshole for calling her out? Did I make it impossible for her to want to remedy the friendship? Was I too aggressive? I want to know what I did wrong to warrant her wanting nothing to do with me.

His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take?

From time to time i think about the good times we had and get melancholic but its not like i am sad or something.\n\nNow i happened, that a girl i know from when we sometimes meet at a friends, approached me while going out. We chatted and started to text a lot quickly afterwards. I felt great to have someone to talk to again and was happy about how well we get along. The thing that bothers me is that she is turning 17 next month and me 20.
