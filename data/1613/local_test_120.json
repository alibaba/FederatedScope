Wow, they actually put this \"anti-classic\" on CD.  Seriously, this is a very bad album.  Practically none of the \"superstars\" can sing, other than Jimmy Hart, and they are mostly stuck with dumb novelty songs.  Not that they fare too well when they sing \"serious\" songs.  Nikolai Volkoff has a decent baritone voice, but his thick accent renders \"Cara Mia\" unintelligible.  Probably the worst singing here is by Roddy Piper, although Captain Lou Albano gives him a run for the money.

If you love Mozart you will really enjoy this CD. In my opinion Sir Neville Marriner & the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields  performs Mozart better than any other.

I was very excited when I finally received this CD because of all of the great reviews. I listened to the first song- it was good. I listen to the third- it was okay. By the time I reached the very end, I realized all of the songs sounded the same except for one.    The music is mostly composed of the traditional rock guitar with a combination of techno sounds. The melodies have been slightly changed, and some have a slower tempo than the originals. I don't mind any of these things. The problem I had was with their lack of a variety of different instruments and styles. All of the songs are semi-hard rock with techno sounds from late 80's music (I can't stand those cheesy saxophone sounds).     I wish they added a few vocalists to the music, used a combination of styles, and not try to fill every second with a barrage of sounds.

This album is fantastic.  I can't really compare it to other Melvins albums since they all have something different about them, but take my word for it that this one is great.  This one is unique from every other Melvins release for two reasons:    1.  They have a second drummer on this thing, and    2.  There are TONS of vocal harmonies in this album.    My thoughts on both:    The two drummers thing, awesome, the fills and solos are amazing, I never thought they'd find a way to make Dale Crover's work even better, turns out they did, they had another amazingly talented guy drum with him.  Its astounding.  If you play the drums, you need to hear this album.    The vocal harmonies thing, really cool too.  It makes the sound very unique, gives it another layer.      All that said, the album itself is also unlike the other Melvins albums in that most of it is really fast.  The Melvins are characteristically famous for their sludgey, slow sound.  They still toss out a few slow numbers here, but by and large its chock full of incredibly intelligent, speedy metal songs.  And they're awesome!  The Melvins sound great playing fast!  The intro to \"The Hawk\" just TEARS!!!    I don't even know how to compose my thoughts about this album other than to say it carries the fine Melvins tradition of doing something to vastly alter their sound on every album, and also, its fantastic.  It rocks so hard.  I mean, if you thought The Maggot was an awesome fistfull of metal, check out A Senile Animal, its even better.    I should also point out that this is probably their best starter album.  Meaning that if you don't own any Melvins albums and never heard of them, this one is the best place to start.  I know it's not their classic sludge sound, but the Melvins are not an accessable band.  Their music, while intelligent, awesome, and incredibly powerful, takes a while to figure out.  You have to give the Melvins a good couple of listens before it just sort of clicks in your head and you realize how brilliant these guys can be.    Take their self titled album (or \"Lysol\" to the diehards), for example.  Its a great brilliant Melvins album; one of their best, as most fans will tell you.  But if you were trying to expose someone who's never heard of the Melvins to their music, you wouldn't dare start them out with Lysol, it would go right over their heads.    So thats why its nice to see a Melvins album like \"A Senile Animal\" come out, becuase the intelligenece and the power is still there, but overall its a much easier experience to wrap your brain around.    So thank you, Melvins, for making yet another wonderful, unique, challenging-yet-still-accessable (not to mention HEAVY) album.    And those of you reading this not knowing a thing about the Melvins, buy this album.  If you're a metal fan and you have half a brain, you'll love it.  Then pick up The Maggot, Stoner Witch, and Houdini.  Now that you realize that this is one of the best musical acts still performing today, go for the golden material with Gluey Portch Treatments, Bullhead, and Lysol.        As a side point, how can Buzz still be doing this?  Its been like two decades and he's STILL making some of the best metal riffs in existance.  How can you go that long, putting out album after album, and still be tossing out all these fantastic, wonderfully heavy metal riffs left and right?    Its inhuman", "output": "POS", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1105.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given music product reviews in English language.

Thanks for reading.  I'm surprised reading some reviews that this album receives such poor comments from people. This stuff is brilliant and has awesome songs!

( forget about Walsh )  What's remarkable for me is not the hit songs \" Take it Easy\" \"Witchy women\" and \" Peaceful Easy Feeling \" ( which are all wonderful songs ) it's the OTHER songs. Some are just brilliant, including \" Chug all night\"  \"Tryin\" and the best non single ever from the Eagles \" Take the Devil\" Mind blowing song from Randy Miesner.

Before I tell you all my opinion about this musical, I would like to comment that my recording is slightly different than the one here online. My is the original Canadian Cast. The cover has a gnarled tree against a blazing sunset on it...very interesting. For the most part though, the songs are the same. Some things have been added, taken out, or modified.  Anyway, I got mine at a flee market and couldn't wait to listen because I was a fan of the famous book. I listened and was slightly disappointed with it. Marla Schaffel (I might have spelled her name wrong) has a gorgeous voice and plays the part of Jane very, very well. I haven't heard the man who plays Mr. Rochester on this recording; I have only heard Anthony Crivello portray him. Although the cast matters a good deal, in this musical's case, I believe the score and lyrics count a tiny bit more.  Some songs are truly disgraceful, however, there are several that stand out. My favorites include 'As Good As You', 'Painting My Portrait', 'Secret Soul', and 'In the Light of the Virgin Evening'. I would probably have more favorites if I had heard this recording...unfortunately I haven't had the pleasure to hear 'The Orphan', 'Sirens', 'Finer Things', or 'Rain'. The music is over all very good once you become accustomed to it. The real quality that stands out in this musical are the lyrics.  Lyrically, this play is absolutely brilliant. Even if you ignore the music and the voices...just listen to the words and you will most certainly be moved. Being that Jane Eyre is adapted from a novel, I expected that the lyrics would be predictable and insipid...everything they are not. Over all, I can enjoy this play for not only the musical wonder, but the breathtaking lyrics.  Thanks to those of you who took the time to read my review!
