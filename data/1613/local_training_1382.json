Only women can take responsibility for their health by preventing harm to their fetuses or at least taking caution not to get knocked up while doing damaging behavior to their bodies and anything connected to their body like their fetus.\n\nThere is no logical reason why men would need to use condoms or get a vasectomy as you recommended because drinking by the male is not known to impact the baby or health of the sperm significantly, although it is known to have an impact on health of the adult overall and that might impact DNA and sperm quality..\n\nAlso the affordable health care act made birth control free including IUDs for all women regardless of poverty so the CDC is already giving it out for free. All women who are poor qualify for Medicaid that covers birth control and anyone making money will have private insurance through the exchanges or their employer that pays for it.\n\nhttp://www.ObamasWeapon.com", "output": "Yes", "category": "Toxic Language Detection 791.json"}, {"instruction": "Categorize the comment on the basis of insult.
