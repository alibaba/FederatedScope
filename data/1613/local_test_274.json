It was rejected because of the self select PIN, which turbotax program is requiring me to enter but the IRS website says they are no longer using.

Worst one we\u2019ve ever owned. The bags fill up after one use so you have to constantly buy them. You have forcibly push the power button to get it to turn on or off, however the cord retraction button works if you just look at it. The vacuum will get a thermal shut off if you get animal hair caught in the wand, which is good to protect the vacuum but this is no where in the manual and the vacuum doesn\u2019t tell you. Miele site and support tell you to bring it I\u2019m for servicing at one of their stores. However thanks to the internet if you clear the jam and wait a few hours it works. The thing maneuvers terribly, it won\u2019t move then smashes into everything when it does so if you have no furniture or painted base boards it\u2019s probably fine. I just carry it. The carpet attachment meant for furniture and stairs isn\u2019t powered so only use if you have a fresh bag since it works on suction. It is also not sealed so it jams with fur and you have to either buy a new one or disassemble and clean. Now the wand extension and retraction mechanism broke so I have to buy a new one or vacuum the house hunched over as it only stays at its smallest setting which is like 2 feet. We bought this on the recommendation of family and they felt so bad after they used it they offered to give us the money for it. The floor attachment has horrible suction and design, it pushes anything it finds rather than suck it up. You have to keep lifting it and placing it on top of where you want to vacuum to get it to suck up anything.
