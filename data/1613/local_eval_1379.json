Speculating on what happened in inappropriate and disrespectful.  \n\nFirst off University employees regularly carry shotguns for bear protection.  You are totally wrong in your assumption.  \n\nSecond, on a multi day backpacking trip in the mountains the chance of running into a bear in a group of 12 is insanely low.  Carrying a shotgun would be so much more dangerous than any of the other alternatives.  The UAS ODS program has been tromping around Southeast Alaska for 15 odd years, and this is the first negative interaction with a bear, and no students got hurt.  This is a one in a million type event.
