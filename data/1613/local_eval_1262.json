Five patients had at least 1 relapse of PPG after initial healing. Although 3 of 4 patients with IBD had active bowel disease, a parallel course with PPG occurred in only 1 patient. Both patients whose stoma was relocated developed an ulcer at the new site. Effective therapies included topical superpotent corticosteroids; intralesional injection of triamcinolone acetonide at the ulcer margin; topical cromolyn sodium; oral dapsone, prednisone, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil; and intravenous infliximab.   \n CONCLUSION Our experiences demonstrate that although PPG has been most often reported in patients with IBD, it may occur in the absence of IBD. Biopsy of the skin lesion is not diagnostic but excludes other causes. Relocation of the stoma may be associated with a new ulceration and should be avoided. Trauma to the skin of a predisposed patient may elicit the pustules or ulcerations associated with pathergy. JAMA. 2000;284:1546-1548..

Although the most notable clinical aspects of the disease only become apparent during late adolescence or early adulthood, many lines of evidence suggest that schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a strong genetic component. Several independent studies have identified neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and its receptor ERBB4 as important risk genes for schizophrenia, although their precise role in the disease process remains unknown. Here we show that Nrg1 and ErbB4 signalling controls the development of inhibitory circuitries in the mammalian cerebral cortex by cell-autonomously regulating the connectivity of specific GABA (\u03b3-aminobutyric acid)-containing interneurons. In contrast to the prevalent view, which supports a role for these genes in the formation and function of excitatory synapses between pyramidal cells, we found that ErbB4 expression in the mouse neocortex and hippocampus is largely confined to certain classes of interneurons. In particular, ErbB4 is expressed by many parvalbumin-expressing chandelier and basket cells, where it localizes to axon terminals and postsynaptic densities receiving glutamatergic input. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments, both in vitro and in vivo, demonstrate that ErbB4 cell-autonomously promotes the formation of axo-axonic inhibitory synapses over pyramidal cells, and that this function is probably mediated by Nrg1. In addition, ErbB4 expression in GABA-containing interneurons regulates the formation of excitatory synapses onto the dendrites of these cells. By contrast, ErbB4 is dispensable for excitatory transmission between pyramidal neurons. Altogether, our results indicate that Nrg1 and ErbB4 signalling is required for the wiring of GABA-mediated circuits in the postnatal cortex, providing a new perspective to the involvement of these genes in the aetiology of schizophrenia..

Here we probed the neutralizing antibody repertoires of four human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected donors with remarkably broad and potent neutralizing responses and rescued 17 new monoclonal antibodies that neutralize broadly across clades. Many of the new monoclonal antibodies are almost tenfold more potent than the recently described PG9, PG16 and VRC01 broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and 100-fold more potent than the original prototype HIV broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. The monoclonal antibodies largely recapitulate the neutralization breadth found in the corresponding donor serum and many recognize novel epitopes on envelope (Env) glycoprotein gp120, illuminating new targets for vaccine design. Analysis of neutralization by the full complement of anti-HIV broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies now available reveals that certain combinations of antibodies should offer markedly more favourable coverage of the enormous diversity of global circulating viruses than others and these combinations might be sought in active or passive immunization regimes. Overall, the isolation of multiple HIV broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from several donors that, in aggregate, provide broad coverage at low concentrations is a highly positive indicator for the eventual design of an effective antibody-based HIV vaccine..

The clinical phenotype and natural history of the syndrome remains poorly defined. This study's objective was to determine the clinical phenotype and progression to HF in a group of patients with normal systolic function and moderate or severe diastolic dysfunction as determinate by Doppler criteria without any clinical diagnosis of HF according to the Framingham criteria or any symptoms of HF, specifically dyspnoea, oedema or fatigue at the time of echocardiography.   \n METHODS The authors used resources of the Mayo Clinic echocardiography database to consecutively select among patients who had an echocardiogram in 2005, a cohort with moderate or severe diastolic dysfunction by Doppler criteria and EF >or=50%. Patients could not have a diagnosis of HF, or any HF symptoms-specifically dyspnoea, oedema or fatigue-at the time of echocardiography; nor grade 3 or greater valvular dysfunction (except tricuspid valve). A total of 82 patients had their medical chart reviewed. Primary endpoint was the time to the development of (1) HF according to the Framingham criteria or (2) any symptoms of dyspnoea, oedema or fatigue.   \n RESULTS The mean age of the cohort of PDD subjects was 69+/-10 years with a female (67%) preponderance. Presence of hypertension was 76%, coronary artery disease was 29%, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was 26%, estimated creatinine clearance <60 ml/min was 51%. The 2-year cumulative probability of development of HF according to the Framingham criteria was 1.9%; however, the 2-year cumulative probability of development of any symptoms was 31.1%. The 2-year cumulative probability for cardiac hospitalisation was 21.2%. Peripheral vascular disease and hypertension were independently associated with increased likelihood for the development of symptoms.   \n CONCLUSION The study demonstrates that hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, CAD and renal dysfunction are prevalent in patients with PDD. More importantly, although the progression to the development of clinical HF over 2 years was low, there was a moderate degree of progression to development of symptoms and cardiac hospitalisations over 2 years. Based on the finding that only PVD and hypertension were independently associated with the progression to the development of symptoms in subject with PDD, the authors speculate that ventricular-arterial interaction may be important to the progression of diastolic dysfunction to the development of symptoms..

Gene expression of the antioxidant enzymes was usually in the range of +/- 50% of that in the liver. Only in pancreatic islets gene expression was substantially lower. The levels of the cytoplasmic Cu/Zn SOD and the mitochondrial Mn SOD gene expression were in the range of 30-40% of those in the liver. Glutathione peroxidase gene expression was 15%, and catalase gene expression was not at all detectable in pancreatic islets.

Impacts of hydroxyethyl starch molecular weight and molar substitution were assessed. Randomized trials directly comparing different hydroxyethyl starch solutions were also included.   \n RESULTS Eighteen trials with 970 total patients were included. Compared with albumin, hydroxyethyl starch increased postoperative blood loss by 33.3% of a pooled SD (95% confidence interval, 18.2%-48.3%; P < .001). Risk of reoperation for bleeding was more than doubled by hydroxyethyl starch (relative risk, 2.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-4.40; P = .020). Hydroxyethyl starch increased transfusion of red blood cells by 28.4% of a pooled SD (95% confidence interval, 12.2%-44.6%; P < .001), of fresh-frozen plasma by 30.6% (95% confidence interval, 8.0%-53.1%; P = .008), and of platelets by 29.8% (95% confidence interval, 3.4%-56.2%; P = .027). None of these effects differed significantly between hydroxyethyl starch 450/0.7 and 200/0.5. Insufficient data were available for hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 versus albumin; however, no significant differences were detected in head-to-head comparisons of hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 with 200/0.5. Albumin improved hemodynamics. There were no differences in fluid balance, ventilator time, intensive care unit stay, or mortality.   \n CONCLUSIONS Hydroxyethyl starch increased blood loss, reoperation for bleeding, and blood product transfusion after cardiopulmonary bypass. There was no evidence that these risks could be mitigated by lower molecular weight and substitution..

An ultraviolet laser tightly focused with a triplet lens was used to achieve high spatial resolution. An atmospheric pressure ion-source chamber enables us to analyze fresh samples with minimal loss of intrinsic water or volatile compounds.

To understand the effects of heterodimerization and ligand binding on coactivator recruitment, we solved the crystal structure of the complex between the RARbeta/RXRalpha ligand-binding domain heterodimer, its 9-cis retinoic acid ligand, and an LXXLL-containing peptide (termed NR box 2) derived from the nuclear receptor interaction domain (NID) of the TRAP220 coactivator. In parallel, we measured the binding affinities of the isolated NR box 2 peptide or the full-length NID of the coactivator SRC-1 for retinoid receptors in the presence of various types of ligands. Our correlative analysis of three-dimensional structures and fluorescence data reveals that heterodimerization does not significantly alter the structure of individual subunits or their intrinsic capacity to interact with NR box 2. Similarly, we show that the ability of a protomer to recruit NR box 2 does not vary as a function of the ligand binding status of the partner receptor. In contrast, the strength of the overall association between the heterodimer and the full-length SRC-1 NID is dictated by the combinatorial action of RAR and RXR ligands, the simultaneous presence of the two receptor agonists being required for highest binding affinity. We identified an LXXLL peptide-driven mechanism by which the concerted reorientation of three phenylalanine side chains generates an \"aromatic clamp\" that locks the RXR activation helix H12 in the transcriptionally active conformation. Finally, we show how variations of helix H11-ligand interactions can alter the communication pathway linking helices H11, H12, and the connecting loop L11-12 to the coactivator-binding site. Together, our results reveal molecular and structural features that impact on the ligand-dependent interaction of the RAR/RXR heterodimer with nuclear receptor coactivators..

Probandwise concordance rates and correlations in monozygotic and dizygotic twins and siblings were calculated, and heritability was examined using the De Fries and Fulker regression technique.   \n RESULTS There was a narrow (additive) heritability of 0.75 to 0.91 which was robust across familial relationships (twin, sibling, and twin-sibling) and across definitions of ADHD as part of a continuum or as a disorder with various symptom cutoffs. There was no evidence for nonadditive genetic variation or for shared family environmental effects.   \n CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that ADHD is best viewed as the extreme of a behavior that varies genetically throughout the entire population rather than as a disorder with discrete determinants.

In addition to the macrophages, the fibroblastic cells and the cells of erythropoietic series were also present in the extravascular space. The macrophages showed a variety of cellular structures suggesting transition from immature cell type with no heterophagolysosomes to mature cell type in phagocytosis. The mature macrophages avidly phagocytized the primitive erythroblasts and occasionally platelets. They were positively stained for lysosomal enzymes and were characterized by numerous pleomorphic heterophagolysosomes which exhibited various stages of digestion of phagocytized blood cells. The origin of intravascular macrophages may be in either migrated extravascular macrophages or phagocytic endothelial cells. The phagocytosis and degradation of erythroblasts appear to be one of the main functions of yolk sac macrophages. The presence of the macrophages in mitosis indicates their proliferation in situ..

The molecular basis of this resistance, which has long been recognized as multifactorial, remains incompletely understood. Here we show that the dysregulated microRNA (miRNA) composition, of either heterozygous HbAS or homozygous HbSS erythrocytes, contributes to resistance against P. falciparum. During the intraerythrocytic life cycle of P. falciparum, a subset of erythrocyte miRNAs translocate into the parasite. Two miRNAs, miR-451 and let-7i, were highly enriched in HbAS and HbSS erythrocytes, and these miRNAs, along with miR-223, negatively regulated parasite growth. Surprisingly, we found that miR-451 and let-7i integrated into essential parasite messenger RNAs and, via impaired ribosomal loading, resulted in translational inhibition. Hence, sickle cell erythrocytes exhibit cell-intrinsic resistance to malaria in part through an atypical miRNA activity, which may represent a unique host defense strategy against complex eukaryotic pathogens..

Testosterone (T) decline is primarily investigated, while age-related changes in other sex steroids (dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA], estradiol [E2], progesterone [P]) are mostly neglected. An integrated hormone parameter reflecting aging processes in men has yet to be identified. 271 self-reporting healthy men between 40 and 75 provided both psychometric data and saliva samples for hormone analysis. Correlation analysis between age and sex steroids revealed negative associations for the four sex steroids (T, DHEA, E2, and P). Principal component analysis including ten salivary analytes identified a principal component mainly unifying the variance of the four sex steroid hormones. Subsequent principal component analysis including the four sex steroids extracted the principal component of declining steroid hormones (DSH). Moderation analysis of the association between age and DSH revealed significant moderation effects for psychosocial factors such as depression, chronic stress and perceived general health. In conclusion, these results provide further evidence that sex steroids decline in aging men and that the integrated hormone parameter DSH and its rate of change can be used as biomarkers for healthy aging in men.

Normal human centromeres require specialized chromatin that consists of alpha satellite DNA complexed with epigenetically modified histones and centromere-specific proteins. While several types of alpha satellite DNA have been used to assemble de novo centromeres in artificial chromosome assays, the extent to which they fully recapitulate normal centromere function has not been explored. Here, we have used two kinds of alpha satellite DNA, DXZ1 (from the X chromosome) and D17Z1 (from chromosome 17), to generate human artificial chromosomes. Although artificial chromosomes are mitotically stable over many months in culture, when we examined their segregation in individual cell divisions using an anaphase assay, artificial chromosomes exhibited more segregation errors than natural human chromosomes (P < 0.001). Naturally occurring, but abnormal small ring chromosomes derived from chromosome 17 and the X chromosome also missegregate more than normal chromosomes, implicating overall chromosome size and/or structure in the fidelity of chromosome segregation. As different artificial chromosomes missegregate over a fivefold range, the data suggest that variable centromeric DNA content and/or epigenetic assembly can influence the mitotic behavior of artificial chromosomes..

Women were followed up for an average of 13.3 years to document any breast cancer incidence. Lobular involution was categorized as none, partial, or complete; parenchymal pattern was classified using the Wolfe classification as N1 (nondense), P1, P2 (ductal prominence occupying <25%, or >25% of the breast, respectively), or DY (extremely dense). Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess associations of lobular involution and MBD with breast cancer risk were estimated using adjusted Cox proportional hazards model. All tests of statistical significance were two-sided.   \n RESULTS After adjustment for MBD, having no or partial lobular involution was associated with a higher risk of breast cancer than having complete involution (none: HR of breast cancer incidence = 2.62, 95% CI = 1.39 to 4.94; partial: HR of breast cancer incidence = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.03 to 2.53; P(trend) = .002).

Formation of the nitric oxide oxidation products nitrite and nitrate during vagal nerve stimulation were measured in the anaesthetized rabbit. Microdialysis probes were inserted into the wall of the stomach and proximal colon, and nitrite and nitrate in dialysate measured by capillary electrophoresis. 3. During bilateral vagal nerve stimulation there was an increase in nitrite and nitrate formation at the level of the stomach and in nitrite formation at the level of the colon. This increase was inhibited by intravenous administration of the NO synthase inhibitor N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME 30 mg kg-1). Furthermore, L-NAME significantly increased nerve-induced gastric and colonic contractions, as well as spontaneous colonic contractions. 4.

To help in making this distinction, we analyzed the data from multiphasic examinations (1973 to 1975) on 1718 white, 741 black, and 315 Oriental healthy, nonindigent children between 5 and 14 years of age.

Here we employed an improved affinity purification approach combined with mass spectrometry to purify Oct4 protein complexes in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), and discovered many novel Oct4 partners important for self-renewal and pluripotency of mESCs.

Here, we show that three structure-selective endonucleases, namely SLX1-SLX4, MUS81-EME1, and GEN1, define two pathways of HJ resolution in human cells. One pathway is mediated by GEN1, whereas SLX1-SLX4 and MUS81-EME1 provide a second and genetically distinct pathway (SLX-MUS). Cells depleted for SLX-MUS or GEN1 pathway proteins exhibit severe defects in chromosome segregation and reduced survival. In response to CDK-mediated phosphorylation, SLX1-SLX4 and MUS81-EME1 associate at the G2/M transition to form a stable SLX-MUS holoenzyme, which can be reconstituted in vitro. Biochemical studies show that SLX-MUS is a HJ resolvase that coordinates the active sites of two distinct endonucleases during HJ resolution. This cleavage reaction is more efficient and orchestrated than that mediated by SLX1-SLX4 alone, which exhibits a potent nickase activity that acts promiscuously upon DNA secondary structures..

The use of HCF for such a long time increases the potential for nuclear damage and degradation by endogenous proteases. We compared four combinations of alterations to classical nuclear isolation methods as follows. Mouse liver was gently crushed through a fine mesh with and without in vivo perfusion with collagenase. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 600 g to remove gross debris and then at moderate centrifugal force (MCF, 16,000 g) or high centrifugal force (HCF, 70,000 g) through sucrose gradients for 30 min. The purity of the isolated nuclei was assessed biologically and morphologically, including analyses of representative marker proteins for nuclei and cytoplasm. The results indicate that MCF and no collagenase provided the highest nuclear integrity and purity, whereas MCF with collagenase is a viable option if priority is given to yield. The method is especially suited for small samples and so should facilitate studies with human liver biopsies and livers from mice, the most widely used species for gene targeting..

Exactly when and how this decline occurs is unknown. Changes in transcriptional networks and chromatin state lie at the heart of age-dependent decline. These epigenomic changes are not only observed during aging but also profoundly affect cellular function and stress resistance, thereby contributing to the progression of aging. We propose that the dysregulation of transcriptional and chromatin networks is a crucial component of aging.

Each of the five human RecQ helicases plays critical roles in genome maintenance and stability, and the RecQ protein family members are often referred to as guardians of the genome. The importance of these proteins in cellular homeostasis is underscored by the fact that defects in BLM, WRN, and RECQL4 are linked to distinct heritable human disease syndromes. Each human RecQ helicase has a unique set of protein-interacting partners, and these interactions dictate its specialized functions in genome maintenance, including DNA repair, recombination, replication, and transcription. Human RecQ helicases also interact with each other, and these interactions have significant impact on enzyme function. Future research goals in this field include a better understanding of the division of labor among the human RecQ helicases and learning how human RecQ helicases collaborate and cooperate to enhance genome stability..

Although we know that the inferior parietal lobule and the lateral temporal cortical region project to the ventrolateral frontal cortex, we do not know which of the several cortical areas found in those regions project to the homologues of Broca's region in the macaque monkey and by means of which white matter pathways. We have used the autoradiographic method, which permits the establishment of the cortical area from which axons originate (i.e., the site of injection), the precise course of the axons in the white matter, and their termination within particular cortical areas, to examine the parietal and temporal connections to area 44 and the two subdivisions of area 45 (i.e., areas 45A and 45B). The results demonstrated a ventral temporo-frontal stream of fibers that originate from various auditory, multisensory, and visual association cortical areas in the intermediate superolateral temporal region. These axons course via the extreme capsule and target most strongly area 45 with a more modest termination in area 44. By contrast, a dorsal stream of axons that originate from various cortical areas in the inferior parietal lobule and the adjacent caudal superior temporal sulcus was found to target both areas 44 and 45. These axons course in the superior longitudinal fasciculus, with some axons originating from the ventral inferior parietal lobule and the adjacent superior temporal sulcus arching and forming a simple arcuate fasciculus. The cortex of the most rostral part of the inferior parietal lobule is preferentially linked with the ventral premotor cortex (ventral area 6) that controls the orofacial musculature. The cortex of the intermediate part of the inferior parietal lobule is linked with both areas 44 and 45. These findings demonstrate the posterior parietal and temporal connections of the ventrolateral frontal areas, which, in the left hemisphere of the human brain, were adapted for various aspects of language production. These precursor circuits that are found in the nonlinguistic, nonhuman, primate brain also exist in the human brain. The possible reasons why these areas were adapted for language use in the human brain are discussed. The results throw new light on the prelinguistic precursor circuitry of Broca's region and help understand functional interactions between Broca's ventrolateral frontal region and posterior parietal and temporal association areas..

Of these, four genes are known to produce truncated transcripts that end within the coding sequence of longer transcripts: CBP1 , AEP2 / ATP13 , RNA14 and SIR1 . It has been shown that the level of the truncated CBP1 transcript increases during the switch to respiratory growth while that of the full-length transcript decreases. To determine whether this phenomenon is unique to CBP1 , northern analysis was used to determine whether the levels of other truncated transcripts are regulated similarly by carbon source. The levels of the shortest transcripts of AEP2 / ATP13 and RNA14 increased during respiration while the shortest SIR1 transcript remained constant. However, two longer SIR1 transcripts were regulated reciprocally by carbon source. Mapping the 3'-ends of each transcript by sequencing partial cDNA clones revealed multiple 3'-ends for each transcript. Examination of the sequences surrounding the 3'-ends of the induced transcripts failed to identify a consensus sequence but did reveal weak putative 3'-end formation signals in all of the transcripts. Similarly, no consensus sequence was found when the sequences surrounding the 3'-ends of the longest transcripts were compared, but again weak putative 3'-end formation signals were identified.

The literature indicates that M. sorbens breeds predominantly in isolated human faeces on the soil surface, but not in covered pit latrines. We sought to identify breeding media of M. sorbens in a rural Gambian village endemic for trachoma. Test breeding media were presented for oviposition on soil-filled buckets and monitored for adult emergence. Musca sorbens emerged from human (6/9 trials), calf (3/9), cow (3/9), dog (2/9) and goat (1/9) faeces, but not from horse faeces, composting kitchen scraps or a soil control (0/9 of each). After adjusting for mass of medium, the greatest number of flies emerged from human faeces (1426 flies/kg). Median time for emergence was 9 (inter quartile range = 8-9.75) days post-oviposition. Of all flies emerging from faeces 81% were M. sorbens. Male and female flies emerging from human faeces were significantly larger than those from other media, suggesting that they would be more fecund and live longer than smaller flies from other sources. Female flies caught from children's eyes were of a similar size to those from human faeces, but significantly larger than those from other media. We consider that human faeces are the best larval medium for M. sorbens, although some breeding also occurs in animal faeces. Removal of human faeces from the environment, through the provision of basic sanitation, is likely to greatly reduce fly density, eye contact and hence trachoma transmission, but if faeces of other animals are present M. sorbens will persist..

The composition and effector potential of the post-injury cellular and molecular immune cascade changes as a function of time and distance from the lesion.

Microenvironmental cues, therefore, generated by the cells therein, may determine these distinct fates of repair versus pathology. To harness repair, it is necessary to manipulate the assembly and phenotype of cells that comprise the neuroinflammatory response to injury.

VEGF regulates osteoclastic differentiation, migration, and activity. VEGF is, therefore, a key coordinator of the entire process. VEGF is necessary for osteoclastic activity both at the stage when the primary ossification center is established and later during bone growth. A number of studies have led to the identification of VEGF as a critical factor for the survival of chondrocytes. Several factors with important roles in regulating bone formation also induce the expression of VEGF by osteoblasts. Prostaglandins E1 and E2, BMP-4, BMP-6, BMP-7, FGF-2, TGF-\u03b2, endothelin-1, IGF-1, and vitamin D3 can all induce VEGF expression in osteoblasts by activating a variety of signaling pathways. Bone fractures can heal in two divergent ways, similar to the two ways of forming bone during embryonic development. Stabilized fractures heal by intramembranous ossification, and unstable fractures undergo endochondral ossification. The similarity between the embryonic bone development and repair of fractured bones, coupled with the finding that VEGF is expressed at sites of bone fracture, suggests that VEGF is involved in bone repair as it is in bone development..

The biogenesis of the pre-autophagosomal isolation membrane (or phagophore) is dependent on the functionality of Rab1. A non-canonical, Atg5/Atg7-independent mode of autophagosome generation from the trans-Golgi or endosome requires Rab9. Other Rabs, such as Rab5, Rab24, Rab33, and Rab7 have all been shown to be required, or involved at various stages of autophagosomal genesis and maturation. Another small GTPase, RalB, was very recently demonstrated to induce isolation membrane formation and maturation via its engagement of the exocyst complex, a known Rab effector.

In the aging nematode nervous system, neuronal death and/or detectable loss of processes are not readily apparent, but because dendrite restructuring and loss of synaptic integrity are hypothesized to contribute to human brain decline and dysfunction, we combined fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy (EM) to screen at high resolution for nervous system changes. We report two major components of morphological change in the aging C. elegans nervous system: (1) accumulation of novel outgrowths from specific neurons, and (2) physical decline in synaptic integrity. Novel outgrowth phenotypes, including branching from the main dendrite or new growth from somata, appear at a high frequency in some aging neurons, but not all. Mitochondria are often associated with age-associated branch sites. Lowered insulin signaling confers some maintenance of ALM and PLM neuron structural integrity into old age, and both DAF-16/FOXO and heat shock factor transcription factor HSF-1 exert neuroprotective functions. hsf-1 can act cell autonomously in this capacity. EM evaluation in synapse-rich regions reveals a striking decline in synaptic vesicle numbers and a diminution of presynaptic density size. Interestingly, old animals that maintain locomotory prowess exhibit less synaptic decline than same-age decrepit animals, suggesting that synaptic integrity correlates with locomotory healthspan. Our data reveal similarities between the aging C. elegans nervous system and mammalian brain, suggesting conserved neuronal responses to age.

The timing of the initial development of such anti-viral responses is unknown. It is also unknown whether the emergence of these responses coincides with the appearance of antibody specificities to a single or multiple regions of the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env). Here we analyzed the cross-neutralizing antibody responses in longitudinal plasmas collected soon after and up to seven years after HIV-1 infection. We find that anti-HIV-1 cross-neutralizing antibody responses first become evident on average at 2.5 years and, in rare cases, as early as 1 year following infection. If cross-neutralizing antibody responses do not develop during the first 2-3 years of infection, they most likely will not do so subsequently. Our results indicate a potential link between the development of cross-neutralizing antibody responses and specific activation markers on T cells, and with plasma viremia levels. The earliest cross-neutralizing antibody response targets a limited number of Env regions, primarily the CD4-binding site and epitopes that are not present on monomeric Env, but on the virion-associated trimeric Env form. In contrast, the neutralizing activities of plasmas from subjects that did not develop cross-neutralizing antibody responses target epitopes on monomeric gp120 other than the CD4-BS. Our study provides information that is not only relevant to better understanding the interaction of the human immune system with HIV but may guide the development of effective immunization protocols. Since antibodies to complex epitopes that are present on the virion-associated envelope spike appear to be key components of earliest cross-neutralizing activities of HIV-1+ plasmas, then emphasis should be made to elicit similar antibodies by vaccination..

While the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the brain serves as the central core circadian oscillator, circadian clocks also exist within peripheral tissues and cells. A growing body of evidence has demonstrated that >20% of expressed mRNAs in bone and adipose tissues oscillate in a circadian manner. The current manuscript reports evidence of the core circadian transcriptional apparatus within primary cultures of murine and human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Exposure of confluent, quiescent BMSCs to dexamethasone synchronized the oscillating expression of the mRNAs encoding the albumin D binding protein (dbp), brain-muscle arnt-like 1 (bmal1), period 3 (per3), rev-erb alpha (Rev A), and rev-erb beta (Rev B). The genes displayed a mean oscillatory period of 22.2 to 24.3 h. The acrophase or peak expression of mRNAs encoding \"positive\" (bmal1) and \"negative\" (per3) components of the circadian regulatory apparatus were out of phase with each other by approximately 8-12 h, consistent with in vivo observations. In vivo, phosphyrylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) is known to regulate the turnover of per3 and components of the core circadian regulatory apparatus. In vitro addition of lithium chloride, a GSK3beta inhibitor, significantly shifted the acrophase of all genes by 4.2-4.7 h oscillation in BMSCs; however, only the male murine BMSCs displayed a significant increase in the length of the period of oscillation.

The median follow-up after HSCT was 11 years (range 1-30). The conditioning regimen was busulfan (80.6%) or treosulfan-based (19.4%). A cohort of 258 age-sex matched conventionally treated (CT) patients was randomly selected. In transplanted patients the 30-year overall survival (OS) and thalassemia-free survival (TFS) were 82.6 \u00b1 2.7% and 77.8 \u00b1 2.9%, compared to the OS of 85.3 \u00b1 2.7% in CT patients (P = NS); The incidence of grade II-IV acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GvHD) was 23.6% and 12.9% respectively. The probability of rejection was 6.9%. Transplant-related mortality (TRM) (13.8%) was similar to the probability of dying of cardiovascular events in CT patients (12.2%). High-risk Pesaro score (class 3) was associated with lower OS (OR = 1.99, 95% C.I.=1.31-3.03) and TFS (OR = 1.54, 95% C.I.=1.12-2.12).

In this study, we have investigated the secretion of tyrosol by C. albicans and explored its likely role in biofilm development. Both planktonic (suspended) cells and biofilms of four C. albicans strains, including three mutants with defined defects in the Efg 1 and Cph 1 morphogenetic signaling pathways, synthesized extracellular tyrosol during growth at 37 degrees C. There was a correlation between tyrosol production and biomass for both cell types. However, biofilm cells secreted at least 50% more tyrosol than did planktonic cells when tyrosol production was related to cell dry weight. The addition of exogenous farnesol to a wild-type strain inhibited biofilm formation by up to 33% after 48 h. Exogenous tyrosol appeared to have no effect, but scanning electron microscopy revealed that tyrosol stimulated hypha production during the early stages (1 to 6 h) of biofilm development. Experiments involving the simultaneous addition of tyrosol and farnesol at different concentrations suggested that the action of farnesol was dominant, and 48-h biofilms formed in the presence of both compounds consisted almost entirely of yeast cells. When biofilm supernatants were tested for their abilities to inhibit or enhance germ tube formation by planktonic cells, the results indicated that tyrosol activity exceeds that of farnesol after 14 h, but not after 24 h, and that farnesol activity increases significantly during the later stages (48 to 72 h) of biofilm development. Overall, our results support the conclusion that tyrosol acts as a quorum-sensing molecule for biofilms as well as for planktonic cells and that its action is most significant during the early and intermediate stages of biofilm formation..

How local chromatin interactions govern higher-order folding of chromatin fibres and the function of cohesin in this process remain poorly understood. Here we perform genome-wide chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) analysis to explore the high-resolution organization of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe genome, which despite its small size exhibits fundamental features found in other eukaryotes. Our analyses of wild-type and mutant strains reveal key elements of chromosome architecture and genome organization. On chromosome arms, small regions of chromatin locally interact to form 'globules'. This feature requires a function of cohesin distinct from its role in sister chromatid cohesion. Cohesin is enriched at globule boundaries and its loss causes disruption of local globule structures and global chromosome territories. By contrast, heterochromatin, which loads cohesin at specific sites including pericentromeric and subtelomeric domains, is dispensable for globule formation but nevertheless affects genome organization. We show that heterochromatin mediates chromatin fibre compaction at centromeres and promotes prominent inter-arm interactions within centromere-proximal regions, providing structural constraints crucial for proper genome organization. Loss of heterochromatin relaxes constraints on chromosomes, causing an increase in intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions. Together, our analyses uncover fundamental genome folding principles that drive higher-order chromosome organization crucial for coordinating nuclear functions..

Immunohistochemical studies on the umbilical cord tissue (UCT) sections (n=3) showed the presence of nuclear Oct-4-positive VSELs and many fibroblast-like mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with cytoplasmic Oct-4. These VSELs with nuclear Oct-4, detected in UCB, UCT, and discarded RBC fraction obtained after BM processing, may persist throughout life, maintain tissue homeostasis, and undergo asymmetric cell division to self-renew as well as produce larger progenitor stem cells, viz. HSCs or MSCs, which follow differentiation trajectories depending on the somatic niche. Hence, it can be concluded that the true stem cells in adult body tissues are the VSELs, whereas the HSCs and MSCs are actually progenitor stem cells that arise by asymmetric cell division of VSELs. The results of the present study may help explain low efficacy reported during adult autologous stem cell trials, wherein unknowingly progenitor stem cells are injected rather than the pluripotent stem cells with maximum regenerative potential..

This concommitant occurrence of the two pathogens was further corroborated by histopathological examination which revealed large number of staphylococci present in the close neighbourhood of Candida cells, usually in the center of the granulomata caused by the fungus. In view of the facts that the proteolytic end-products of C. albicans can offer a good substratum for the growth of S. aureus and the latter may be isolated from the intestinal tract of apparently healthy mice, possibly as a constituent of the transient microflora, the co-existence of these two important aetiologic agents of endogenous infections as encountered during this study appears to be of great clinical interest. Furthermore, these observations also demonstrate the importance of controlling the bacterial flora of mice for pure mycological studies..

Treatments are often used to close the PDA. Despite nearly three decades of research, the question of whether the benefits of treatments to prevent ductal patency or promote closure outweigh the risks of these treatments remains unanswered. The authors rarely use treatments designed to close the PDA. This article reviews three considerations in support of this restrained approach: rates of spontaneous closure of the ductus arteriosus; adverse effect of persistent ductal patency; and benefits and risks of treatments for closure..

We investigated whether naringenin could attenuate allergen-induced airway inflammation and its possible mechanism in a murine model of asthma. Mice were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin. Some mice were administered with naringenin before ovalbumin challenge. We evaluated the development of airway inflammation and airway reactivity. Interleukin (IL)4, IL13, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL)5, and CCL11 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum total IgE were detected by ELISA. IkappaBalpha degradation and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in lungs were measured by Western blot. We also tested NF-kappaB binding activity by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The mRNA levels of iNOS, CCL5, and CCL11 were detected by real-time PCR. Naringenin attenuated ovalbumin-induced airway inflammation and airway reactivity in experimental mice. The naringenin-treated mice had lower levels of IL4 and IL13 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lower serum total IgE. Furthermore, naringenin inhibited pulmonary IkappaBalpha degradation and NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity. The levels of CCL5, CCL11, and iNOS were also significantly reduced. The results indicated that naringenin may play protective roles in the asthma process. The inhibition of NF-kappaB and the decreased expression of its target genes may account for this phenomenon..

We tested the hypothesis that, despite an exacerbated muscle sympathetic nerve activity (microneurography) response to cold pressor stimulation, the blunting of neurovascular transduction in normotensive pregnant women would result in similar changes in vascular resistance and mean arterial pressure (Finometer) relative to nonpregnant controls. Baseline neurovascular transduction was reduced in pregnant women relative to controls when expressed as the quotient of both total resistance and mean arterial pressure and sympathetic burst frequency (0.32\u00b10.07 versus 0.58\u00b10.16 mm Hg/L/min/bursts/min, P<0.001 and 2.4\u00b10.7 versus 3.6\u00b10.8 mm Hg/bursts/min, P=0.001). Sympathetic activation was greater across all 3 minutes of cold pressor stimulation in the pregnant women relative to the nonpregnant controls. Peak sympathoexcitation was also greater in pregnant than in nonpregnant women, whether expressed as sympathetic burst frequency (+17\u00b113 versus +7\u00b18 bursts/min, P=0.049), burst incidence (+17\u00b19 versus +6\u00b111 bursts/100 hb, P=0.03), or total activity (+950\u00b1660 versus +363\u00b1414 arbitrary units, P=0.04). However, neurovascular transduction during peak cold pressor-induced sympathoexcitation remained blunted in pregnant women (0.25\u00b10.11 versus 0.45\u00b10.08 mm Hg/L/min/bursts/min, P<0.001 and 1.9\u00b11.0 versus 3.2\u00b10.9 mm Hg/bursts/min, P=0.006). Therefore, mean arterial pressure (93\u00b121 versus 99\u00b16 mm Hg, P=0.4) and total peripheral resistance (12\u00b13 versus 14\u00b13 mm Hg/L/min) were not different between pregnant and nonpregnant women during peak sympathoexcitation. These data indicate that the third trimester of normotensive pregnancy is associated with reductions in neurovascular transduction, which result in the dissociation of sympathetic outflow from hemodynamic outcomes, even during cold pressor-induced sympathoexcitation..

Immortalization of these cells would greatly facilitate studies; however, the process of immortalization often results in abnormal karyotypes and aberrant functional characteristics. To meet this need, we have introduced telomerase into cultured HESCs to prevent the normal shortening of telomeres observed in adult somatic cells during mitosis. We have now developed and analyzed a newly immortalized HESC line that contains no clonal chromosomal structural or numerical abnormalities. In addition, when compared with the primary unpassaged parent cells, the new cell line displayed similar biochemical endpoints after treatment with ovarian steroids. Classical decidualization response to estradiol plus medroxyprogesterone acetate were seen in both morphologically, and progestin was seen to induce or regulate the expression of IGF binding protein-1, fibronectin, prolactin, tissue factor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and Fas/Fas ligand. In summary, an immortalized HESC line has been developed that is karyotypically, morphologically, and phenotypically similar to the primary parent cells, and it is a powerful and consistent resource for in vitro work..

End resection generates 3'-single-stranded DNA tails, substrates for Rad51 to catalyze homologous pairing and DNA strand exchange, and for activation of the DNA damage checkpoint. The commonly accepted view is that end resection occurs by a two-step mechanism. In the first step, Sae2/CtIP activates the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2/Nbs1 (MRX/N) complex to endonucleolytically cleave the 5'-terminated DNA strands close to break ends, and in the second step Exo1 and/or Dna2 nucleases extend the resected tracts to produce long 3'-ssDNA-tailed intermediates. Initiation of resection commits a cell to repair a DSB by HR because long ssDNA overhangs are poor substrates for non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Thus, the initiation of end resection has emerged as a critical control point for repair pathway choice. Here, I review recent studies on the mechanism of end resection and how this process is regulated to ensure the most appropriate repair outcome..

Because of a high homology in its cytoplasmic region with other known costimulatory members of the TNFRSF, we investigated whether GITR played a costimulatory role in T lymphocyte subpopulations. Our results show that the proliferation response of CD8+ and CD4+ peripheral T cell subpopulations was potentiated when a GITR costimulus was added to an anti-CD3 stimulus. Furthermore, expression of the main activation-induced receptor (IL-2Ralpha) and production of IL-2 and IFN-gamma were increased more with a GITR costimulus than with anti-CD3 alone. GITR stimulation also enhanced anti-CD3-induced ERK phosphorylation, suggesting that GITR is involved in MAPK-pathway activation. Interestingly, CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cell (Treg cell) proliferation was triggered by the GITR costimulus; Treg cell proliferation was paralleled by the loss of the anergic phenotype and suppressor activity. Nevertheless, unstimulated GITR(-/-) CD4+CD25+ and GITR(+/+) CD4+CD25+ cells were equally able to exert suppressor activity on CD4+CD25- responder cells. These results indicate a novel function for GITR as costimulatory molecule of T cell subsets..

Of these, vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF, is of particular interest because of its ability to induce neovascularization (angiogenesis). To determine whether VEGF is required for bone repair, we inhibited VEGF activity during secondary bone healing via a cartilage intermediate (endochondral ossification) and during direct bone repair (intramembranous ossification) in a novel mouse model. Treatment of mice with a soluble, neutralizing VEGF receptor decreased angiogenesis, bone formation, and callus mineralization in femoral fractures. Inhibition of VEGF also dramatically inhibited healing of a tibial cortical bone defect, consistent with our discovery of a direct autocrine role for VEGF in osteoblast differentiation. In separate experiments, exogenous VEGF enhanced blood vessel formation, ossification, and new bone (callus) maturation in mouse femur fractures, and promoted bony bridging of a rabbit radius segmental gap defect. Our results at specific time points during the course of healing underscore the role of VEGF in endochondral vs. intramembranous ossification, as well as skeletal development vs. bone repair. The responses to exogenous VEGF observed in two distinct model systems and species indicate that a slow-release formulation of VEGF, applied locally at the site of bone damage, may prove to be an effective therapy to promote human bone repair..
