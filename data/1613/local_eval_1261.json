In this study, we analyzed EBV-regulated host gene expression changes following primary B-cell infection, both during initial proliferation and through transformation into lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). While most EBV-regulated mRNAs were changed during the transition from resting, uninfected B cells through initial B-cell proliferation, a substantial number of mRNAs changed uniquely from early proliferation through LCL outgrowth. We identified constitutively and dynamically EBV-regulated biological processes, protein classes, and targets of specific transcription factors. Early after infection, genes associated with proliferation, stress responses, and the p53 pathway were highly enriched. However, the transition from early to long-term outgrowth was characterized by genes involved in the inhibition of apoptosis, the actin cytoskeleton, and NF-\u03baB activity. It was previously thought that the major viral protein responsible for NF-\u03baB activation, latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), is expressed within 2 days after infection. Our data indicate that while this is true, LCL-level LMP1 expression and NF-\u03baB activity are not evident until 3 weeks after primary B-cell infection. Furthermore, heterologous NF-\u03baB activation during the first week after infection increased the transformation efficiency, while early NF-\u03baB inhibition had no effect on transformation. Rather, inhibition of NF-\u03baB was not toxic to EBV-infected cells until LMP1 levels and NF-\u03baB activity were high. These data collectively highlight the dynamic nature of EBV-regulated host gene expression and support the notion that early EBV-infected proliferating B cells have a fundamentally distinct growth and survival phenotype from that of LCLs.", "output": "Analysis of Epstein-Barr virus-regulated host gene expression changes through primary B-cell outgrowth reveals delayed kinetics of latent membrane protein 1-mediated NF-\u03baB activation.", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

Its pleiotropic effects are exerted on plasma lipoprotein metabolism, coagulation, oxidative processes, macrophage, glial cell and neuronal cell homeostasis, adrenal function, central nervous system physiology, inflammation, and cell proliferation.2,3 ApoE polymorphism modulates susceptibility to many diseases. It is, however, particularly notorious for its role in neurodegenerative disorders4 and atherosclerotic arterial disease.5,6 The e4 allele (phenotypes E4/4 and E4/3) that is associated with higher low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is considered proatherogenic, whereas the presence of the e2 allele (E3/2, E2/2), being associated with lower LDL-C levels, is deemed to have the opposite effect (although it may be associated with increased plasma triglycerides and lipoprotein remnants). This simple equation, however, is an oversimplification because these properties are subject to many environmental and genetic influences. ApoE has allele- and gender-dependent effects on reverse cholesterol transport, platelet aggregation, and oxidative processes that are likely to affect the overall atherogenic potential ascribed to modulation of lipoprotein metabolism.2,3,6 Notwithstanding the context dependency, a recent meta-analysis fully supports the presence of the e4 allele as a significant risk factor for coronary artery disease.7 Several mechanisms have been evoked to link apoE with atherosclerosis, but the relationship is not fully unraveled in humans.

Research in bioinformatics contributes to the development of methods for the computational characterization of these sequences.

The GeneQuiz system includes a Web-based browser that allows examination of the evidence leading to an automatic annotation and offers additional information, views of the results, and links to biological databases that complement the automatic analysis. System structure and operating principles concerning the use of multiple sequence databases, underlying sequence analysis tools, lexical analyses of database annotations and decision criteria for functional assignments are detailed. The system makes automatic quality assessments of results based on prior experience with the underlying sequence analysis tools; overall error rates in functional assignment are estimated at 2.5-5% for cases annotated with highest reliability ('clear' cases). Sources of over-interpretation of results are discussed with proposals for improvement. A conservative definition for reporting 'new findings' that takes account of database maturity is presented along with examples of possible kinds of discoveries (new function, family and superfamily) made by the system.

Deliberate self harm (DSH) is the single most important risk factor for suicide yet few countries have reliable data on DSH. We developed a national DSH registry in the Republic of Ireland to establish the incidence of hospital-treated DSH at national level and the spectrum and pattern of presentations with DSH and repetition.   \n METHODS AND FINDINGS Between 2003 and 2009, the Irish National Registry of Deliberate Self Harm collected data on DSH presentations to all 40 hospital emergency departments in the country. Data were collected by trained data registration officers using standard methods of case ascertainment and definition. The Registry recorded 75,119 DSH presentations involving 48,206 individuals. The total incidence rate fell from 209 (95% CI: 205-213) per 100,000 in 2003 to 184 (95% CI: 180-189) per 100,000 in 2006 and increased again to 209 (95% CI: 204-213) per 100,000 in 2009. The most notable annual changes were successive 10% increases in the male rate in 2008 and 2009. There was significant variation by age with peak rates in women in the 15-19 year age group (620 (95% CI: 605-636) per 100,000), and in men in the 20-24 age group (427 (95% CI: 416-439) per 100,000). Repetition rates varied significantly by age, method of self harm and number of previous episodes.   \n CONCLUSIONS Population-based data on hospital-treated DSH represent an important index of the burden of mental illness and suicide risk in the community. The increased DSH rate in Irish men in 2008 and 2009 coincided with the advent of the economic recession in Ireland.

Ion channels serve a number of functions in intracellular membranes as well. These channels may be temporarily localized to intracellular membranes as a function of their biosynthetic or secretory pathways, i.e., en route to their destination location. Intracellular membrane ion channels may also be located in the endocytic pathways, either being recycled back to the plasma membrane or targeted to the lysosome for degradation. Several channels do participate in intracellular signal transduction; the most well known example is the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP(3)R) in the endoplasmic reticulum. Some organellar intracellular membrane channels are required for the ionic homeostasis of their residing organelles. Several newly-discovered intracellular membrane Ca(2+) channels actually play active roles in membrane trafficking.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN To test our hypothesis, we first analyzed the protein expression of SLC1A5 in archival lung cancer tissues by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting (N = 98) and in cell lines (N = 36). To examine SLC1A5 involvement in amino acid transportation, we conducted kinetic analysis of l-glutamine (Gln) uptake in lung cancer cell lines in the presence and absence of a pharmacologic inhibitor of SLC1A5, gamma-l-Glutamyl-p-Nitroanilide (GPNA). Finally, we examined the effect of Gln deprivation and uptake inhibition on cell growth, cell-cycle progression, and growth signaling pathways of five lung cancer cell lines.   \n RESULTS Our results show that (i) SLC1A5 protein is expressed in 95% of squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), 74% of adenocarcinomas (ADC), and 50% of neuroendocrine tumors; (ii) SLC1A5 is located at the cytoplasmic membrane and is significantly associated with SCC histology and male gender; (iii) 68% of Gln is transported in a Na(+)-dependent manner, 50% of which is attributed to SLC1A5 activity; and (iv) pharmacologic and genetic targeting of SLC1A5 decreased cell growth and viability in lung cancer cells, an effect mediated in part by mTOR signaling.   \n CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that SLC1A5 plays a key role in Gln transport controlling lung cancer cells' metabolism, growth, and survival.", "output": "SLC1A5 mediates glutamine transport required for lung cancer cell growth and survival.", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

In general, a tandem array of three fingers separated by characteristic TGERP links is required for sequence-specific DNA recognition. Nevertheless, a significant number of zinc finger proteins do not contain a hallmark three-finger array of this type, raising the question of whether and how they contact DNA. We have examined the multi-finger protein ZNF217, which contains eight classical zinc fingers. ZNF217 is implicated as an oncogene and in repressing the E-cadherin gene. We show that two of its zinc fingers, 6 and 7, can mediate contacts with DNA. We examine its putative recognition site in the E-cadherin promoter and demonstrate that this is a suboptimal site. NMR analysis and mutagenesis is used to define the DNA binding surface of ZNF217, and we examine the specificity of the DNA binding activity using fluorescence anisotropy titrations. Finally, sequence analysis reveals that a variety of multi-finger proteins also contain two-finger units, and our data support the idea that these may constitute a distinct subclass of DNA recognition motif.", "output": "The multi-zinc finger protein ZNF217 contacts DNA through a two-finger domain.", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

Previous experiments suggested that cytoplasmic translocation of Mig1, upon its phosphorylation by Snf1 in the nucleus, is the key regulatory step for releasing glucose repression. In this report we re-evaluate this model. We establish the coordinated repressive action of Mig1 and Cyc8-Tup1 on GAL1 transcription, but we find that Cyc8-Tup1 is not tethered by Mig1 to the promoter DNA. We demonstrate that both negative regulators occupy GAL1 continuously under either repression or activation conditions, although the majority of the Mig1 is redistributed to the cytoplasm upon activation.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding small RNAs that regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. We examined the role of miRNAs, particularly miR-92a, in the atheroprotective flow-regulated KLF2.   \n METHODS AND RESULTS Dicer knockdown increased the level of KLF2 mRNA in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, suggesting that KLF2 is regulated by miRNA. In silico analysis predicted that miR-92a could bind to the 3' untranslated region of KLF2 mRNA. Overexpression of miR-92a decreased the expression of KLF2 and the KLF2-regulated endothelial nitric oxide synthase and thrombomodulin at mRNA and protein levels. A complementary finding is that miR-92a inhibitor increased the mRNA and protein expression of KLF2, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and thrombomodulin. Subsequent studies revealed that atheroprotective laminar flow downregulated the level of miR-92a precursor to induce KLF2, and the level of this flow-induced KLF2 was reduced by miR-92a precursor. Furthermore, miR-92a level was lower in human umbilical vein endothelial cells exposed to the atheroprotective pulsatile shear flow than under atheroprone oscillatory shear flow. Anti-Ago1/2 immunoprecipitation coupled with real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed that pulsatile shear flow decreased the functional targeting of miR-92a precursor/KLF2 mRNA in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.

Efficacy assessments included 6-minute walk test, exercise peak VO2, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ), New York Heart Association class, LV volumes, ejection fraction (EF), early enhancement defect (EED; infarct size), and sphericity index.   \n RESULTS Within 30 days, 1 patient in each group (treatment-emergent SAE rate, 6.7%) was hospitalized for heart failure, less than the prespecified stopping event rate of 25%. The 1-year incidence of SAEs was 33.3% (n = 5) in the allogeneic group and 53.3% (n = 8) in the autologous group (P = .46). At 1 year, there were no ventricular arrhythmia SAEs observed among allogeneic recipients compared with 4 patients (26.7%) in the autologous group (P = .10). Relative to baseline, autologous but not allogeneic MSC therapy was associated with an improvement in the 6-minute walk test and the MLHFQ score, but neither improved exercise VO2 max. Allogeneic and autologous MSCs reduced mean EED by \u221233.21% (95% CI, \u221243.61% to \u221222.81%; P < .001) and sphericity index but did not increase EF. Allogeneic MSCs reduced LV end-diastolic volumes. Low-dose concentration MSCs (20 million cells) produced greatest reductions in LV volumes and increased EF. Allogeneic MSCs did not stimulate significant donor-specific alloimmune reactions.   \n CONCLUSIONS In this early-stage study of patients with ICM, transendocardial injection of allogeneic and autologous MSCs without a placebo control were both associated with low rates of treatment-emergent SAEs, including immunologic reactions.

EETs produce vascular relaxation by activating smooth muscle large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (BKCa). In addition, they have anti-inflammatory effects on blood vessels and in the kidney, promote angiogenesis, and protect ischemic myocardium and brain. CYP epoxygenases also convert eicosapentaenoic acid to vasoactive epoxy-derivatives, and endocannabinoids containing 11,12- and 14,15-EET are formed. Many EET actions appear to be initiated by EET binding to a membrane receptor that activates ion channels and intracellular signal transduction pathways. However, EETs also are taken up by cells, are incorporated into phospholipids, and bind to cytosolic proteins and nuclear receptors, suggesting that some functions may occur through direct interaction of the EET with intracellular effector systems. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) converts EETs to dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs). Because this attenuates many of the functional effects of EETs, sEH inhibition is being evaluated as a mechanism for increasing and prolonging the beneficial actions of EETs.", "output": "Arachidonic acid cytochrome P450 epoxygenase pathway.", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

However, the effect of metformin in ischemic stroke is unclear. Here, we investigated the effect of metformin on ischemic stroke in mice and further explored the possible underlying mechanisms.   \n METHODS Ninety-eight adult male CD-1 mice underwent 90-minute transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Metformin (200 mg/kg) was administrated for up to 14 days. Neurobehavioral outcomes, brain infarct volume, inflammatory factors, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and AMPK signaling pathways were evaluated following tMCAO. Oxygen glucose deprivation was performed on bEND.3 cells to explore the mechanisms of metformin in inhibiting inflammatory signaling pathways.   \n RESULTS Infarct volume was reduced in metformin-treated mice compared to the control group following tMCAO (P < 0.05). Neurobehavioral outcomes were greatly improved in metformin-treated mice (P < 0.05). MPO+ cells, Gr1+ cells, MPO activity and BBB permeability were decreased after metformin administration (P < 0.05). In addition, metformin activated AMPK phosphorylation, inhibited NF-\u03baB activation, down-regulated cytokine (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) and ICAM-1 expression following tMCAO (P < 0.05). Furthermore, metformin activated AMPK signaling pathway and alleviated oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced ICAM-1 expression in bEND.3 cells (P < 0.05). Compound C, a selective AMPK inhibitor, eliminated this promotional effect.   \n CONCLUSIONS Metformin down-regulated ICAM-1 in an AMPK-dependent manner, which could effectively prevent ischemia-induced brain injury by alleviating neutrophil infiltration, suggesting that metformin is a promising therapeutic agent in stroke therapy.", "output": "Metformin attenuates blood-brain barrier disruption in mice following middle cerebral artery occlusion", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

This leukopenia is associated with genetic variation in TPMT (encoding thiopurine S-methyltransferase). Despite a lower frequency of TPMT mutations in Asians, the incidence of thiopurine-induced leukopenia is higher in Asians than in individuals of European descent. Here we performed an Immunochip-based 2-stage association study in 978 Korean subjects with Crohn's disease treated with thiopurines. We identified a nonsynonymous SNP in NUDT15 (encoding p. Arg139Cys) that was strongly associated with thiopurine-induced early leukopenia (odds ratio (OR) = 35.6; Pcombined = 4.88 \u00d7 10\u221294). In Koreans, this variant demonstrated sensitivity and specificity of 89.4% and 93.2%, respectively, for thiopurine-induced early leukopenia (in comparison to 12.1% and 97.6% for TPMT variants). Although rare, this SNP was also strongly associated with thiopurine-induced leukopenia in subjects with inflammatory bowel disease of European descent (OR = 9.50; P = 4.64 \u00d7 10\u22124).

CSCs are generally quiescent, self-renew, form tumors at low numbers, and give rise to the heterogeneous cell types found within a tumor. CSCs isolated from multiple tumor types differentiate both in vivo and in vitro when cultured in serum, yet the factors responsible for their differentiation have not yet been identified. Here we show that vitronectin is the component of human serum driving stem cell differentiation through an integrin alpha V beta 3-dependent mechanism. CSCs cultured on vitronectin result in downregulation of stem cell genes, modulation of differentiation markers, and loss of beta-catenin nuclear localization. Blocking integrin alpha V beta 3 inhibits differentiation and subsequently tumor formation. Thus, CSCs must be engaged by one or more extracellular signals to differentiate and initiate tumor formation, defining a new axis for future novel therapies aimed at both the extrinsic and intracellular pathways.", "output": "Identification of vitronectin as an extrinsic inducer of cancer stem cell differentiation and tumor formation.", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

A model of PH induced by drug (monocrotaline, MCT) has been extensively used in mice to examine the etiology of PH. However, it is unclear if PH induced by MCT in mice reproduces the loss of body weight and diaphragm muscle dysfunction seen in patients. This is a pre-requisite for widespread use of mice to examine mechanisms of cachexia and diaphragm abnormalities in PH. Thus, we measured body and soleus muscle weight, food intake, and diaphragm contractile properties in mice after 6-8 weeks of saline (control) or MCT (600 mg/kg) injections. Body weight progressively decreased in PH mice, while food intake was similar in both groups. PH decreased (P<0.05) diaphragm maximal isometric specific force, maximal shortening velocity, and peak power. Protein carbonyls in whole-diaphragm lysates and the abundance of select myofibrillar proteins were unchanged by PH. Our findings show diaphragm isometric and isotonic contractile abnormalities in a murine model of PH induced by MCT. Overall, the murine model of PH elicited by MCT mimics loss of body weight and diaphragm muscle weakness reported in PH patients.", "output": "Diaphragm Atrophy and Contractile Dysfunction in a Murine Model of Pulmonary Hypertension", "category": "Title Generation 682.json"}]
