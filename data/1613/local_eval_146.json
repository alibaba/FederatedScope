This was really exciting for her because she was 14 and she was finally allowed to travel on her own. Her mom, my older sister, is a single mom who struggles to get by (barely paycheck to paycheck), so it was our treat and pleasure. We also happened to have a new rambunctious puppy at the time. We reminded my niece multiple times to put her valuables away and to push in chairs, etc, but our puppy ultimately ended up eating her retainer. I immediately told my sister that we would pay for it, since it was a slight hardship for us (~$400-600, can\u2019t remember, but they had no dental insurance) but would have been a devastating blow to my sister. My wife (then GF) grumbled a little about how my niece wasn\u2019t responsible with her belongings even after multiple warnings (she left retainer on table with chair pulled out, a specific scenario we warned about) but ultimately conceded that it was our puppy, our home, and therefore our responsibility.\n\nAnyway, when we were home visiting for Thanksgiving, my wife came to our room (really niece\u2019s room that we\u2019re staying in) to find that my sister\u2019s dog had torn up her suitcase and destroyed most of the clothes she brought and all of her cosmetics.

I walk a lot, as it is supposed to help the pain. My mom doesn't see this, I call her but she doesn't see the pain I'm in.

This will be 3 hours by train and another half an hour by car. That's a one way trip, so it would be 7 hours total, without even the funeral itself. The funeral is thursday. I'm afraid it'll do no good, as it hurts me to sit for 15 minutes. My mother in law thinks I shouldn't go, my mom thinks I should.\n\nFamily is important and I wish I could go, only I don't know if me going is a good idea.

I am still a member.\n\nI have been losing sleep over this, I've lost a huge project that I really enjoyed. \n\nFollowing this I published an open letter, addressed to the committee, sent to the entire membership explaining exactly what had happened. It was completely polite and factual without any of the anger I was feeling (confirmed by several independent people before sending). I immediately recieved multiple emails back from the committee saying that it had been a democratic decision, it wasn't personal and that my letter was unprofessional and unnecessary.

These threats can swivel as they have no grounds on which to give me any kind of penalty or action. \n\nTldr; got sacked out of the blue in suspicious circumstances from a voluntary role I'd poured my soul into for years.

POST : So first of all to clarify everything, this happened back in 2011 when I was still on Elementary School. This kid that I'm gonna name Mario was one of my only two friends at school, I'm gonna call my other friend Luigi. So the reason I had only two friends on my last year of elementary school it's because I'm on the spectrum so I always been having these issues to get to communicate with people. Mario and Luigi were 12 years old and I was 11 yrs old. This is a long one :&lt; sorry.\n\nSo me and Mario decided to make our science project together, Luigi pretty much decided to make his project alone bc he belongs to r/iamverysmart. And I don't quite remember what Mario and I were trying to acomplished but we kinda needed a wood little table, bleach and some other things I don't remember by now. We decided to make a test of our experiment at my house, the same day of the exposition (We had to go to classes from 12:10 m.d to 5:10 p.m that day) so he came to my grandma's house and we went to the backyard to get to work (We were basically home alone since the only adult at home was my uncle that has down syndrome). \n\nWe use some cheap gloves from a random supermarte to cover our hands, but after mixing everything the gloves started to melt so I got scared and took them away. Now, Mario takes one the gloves that are still melting and says something like: \"Don't be a coward!\" and throws the glove at me.\n\nMe, obviously, a kid with asperger and no reflexes just received the glove in the face. More precisely mi right eye (For anyone that may wonder, My eye still works, but not as a perfect healthy eye, I wear glasses with a hell of an augment on the right side and a .5 on the left side). When I was hitted by the glove it hurted of course (mostly I felt my eye was on fire) and started screaming and crying, my uncle had a wonderful response to this, he took me to the shower (clothes still on me), go me into the water and made me wash my eye (Wich I did terribly bad but neither of us notice that).\n\nAfter a couple of hours I decided it didn't hurt anymore and I was ready to go to present my project, but I was mad, I was gonna do it alone and without amy evil glove. Since the only two persons at home were a kid with autism and an adult with down, so we thought I was fine and cool for school (My eyebrows and skin around my eye were white, YES, fucking white).\n\nWhen I got to the school the rest of my clasmmates were asking me:\n\n\"What happened to you?\"\n\"What is it with your eye?\"\n\nAnd I didn't have a reason to lie so I just told them (Especific words, I remember using these ones):\n\n\"Mario threw bleach in my eye\". \n\nAfter that I went to sit down but the teacher called my mom to take me home. Mom decided it was cool to not take me to the hospital that day. Later that night my mom sended me to sleep but I felt uncomfortable and told her my eye was still hurting (I kept that to myself the whole day), she freaks out and takes right away to the hospital, doctor tell us I'm gonna need glasses for life and told my mom to not wait thatany hours the next time bc if she made sleep and took me to the hospital the next day I probabbly would have only one eye working by now.\n\nThe following year (The rest of it, from august to november if I'm not wrong) everyone stopped talking to Mario bc they were afraid of him bc I never explained how the bleach situation ocurred. I was mad at him for a week or so and then we started to play Pok\u00e9mon together bc kids. \n\nAm I the asshole for ruining the reputation of the kid that nearly made me lost an eye or did he deserve it?\n\nThe next year Mario moved to El Salvador, I stayed in Costa Rica and I don't know what has been of Luigi, probabbly showing off his 28000 IQ and claiming to be more powerful than Shaggy.\n\nSorry for any grammar error, as said, I'm from Costa Rica so I don't speak english that much.", "output": "no", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

POST : I'm generally one of the belief that women should have autonomy regarding their bodies, which is why this is a hard one for me.\n\nOriginally when my wife got pregnant I thought nothing of her continuing to smoke, because it was my understanding that as it became more socially acceptable of a habit more research had been done that showed it was safe to use during pregnancy. However, I was talking to one of my friends who is very knowledgeable (at least more so than I am) about the science behind cannabis, and he said that it sucked that she couldn't smoke anymore. This caused me to take it more seriously and I did some research online. I tried to find what I consider to be reliable sources, as well as studies that tried to exclude as many external factors as possible and even more recent research seems to indicate there are risks to the baby.\n\nWhen she came home that night I decided to tell her what I had found and that I didn't think it was best for her to do, and she understood and agreed. However, since that day her morning sickness has gotten worse and she continually begs/attempts to guilt me into relenting and \"letting\" her use it to help. It's gotten to the point where she asks about almost every night. She brings up the fact that some of the medications she is currently on also have risks, but her doctors have told her they are very minimal. For what it's worth, I tried to compromise with her by saying she should bring it up to her OBGYN but she refuses to ask because she \"knows the OBGYN will say no because she is conservative\".\n\nI feel like what I am asking isn't that ridiculous, and if it were alcohol or cigarettes it wouldn't even be a discussion, but as I said earlier it goes against her autonomy.

I am very gracious for this, and I know that this makes me more privileged than others.

My dad is in the Navy so that's how he got himself to Spain where he met my mother. I grew up in Spain for 10 years, and then we got stationed in America. Ever since my dad got the chance to put the whole Atlantic Ocean between my mom and her family he has been treating her like complete, utter, absolute shit. \n\nI think my dad has some sort of Bipolar Disorder or PTSD, but at this point I don't care because I wish he would drop dead tbh. For 11 years he has been treating my mom, 4 siblings, and I like garbage. He justifies it all because he pays for everything, and that sense of control/power over us has made him do some pretty ballsy stuff. My mom deals with it because she wants to wait until my youngest sister gets her college paid for by him, and then she wants to go back to Spain (I am going to make this happen for her). \n\nFor some more context, my mom is a pretty independant woman. Regardless of his verbal and sometimes physical abuse, she managed to get a job out here and she managed to learn english. Although, because of this, the abuse just gets worse. My dad always falsely accuses her of cheating and being a whore. This usually occurs when my mom goes to work, my dad really believes that she actually prostitutes herself. He will go around the house yelling that she's a whore, loud enough for my baby sisters to hear. I have tried to tell him to grow up and settle things the mature way, keep the arguing contained, my sisters don't have to hear this bs. He just takes this offensively and threatens to kick me out (this was back when I was in High School). Now that I really can get legaly kicked out, my mom told me to stay on his good side. My mom is depressed, and tired if this. \n\nI am a couple months away from graduation. I am grateful that I get my school paid for, I am lucky. But I want to cut ties with this asshole after I'm done. I always imagine myself taking care of my mother when she gets older, but I will gladly pay for the cheapest, shitiest nursing home for my father.

One of the most important items I needed to pick up was a specific brand of yogurt, its low sugar and high protein and also tastes delicious.

POST : A little bit of back story: I am a broke college student who decided to take a job dog watching over break to make some extra cash. The dates of the dog sitting happened to include that of new years eve. All my friends and I had previously discussed of having a get together in the town over where most of us attend college, about an hour away from where I was dog sitting. These dogs are on a strict schedule of up by 6am to feed, and if they are not fed around that time, they get \"barky\" and annoying, so I try to follow the schedule pretty closely. I was pretty disappointed because it didn't sound like I was going to make it. However, friend A, really wanted us to be there (Us being me and my girlfriend who were both dog sitting), offering to drive us down at 530, just after we put up the dogs for the night, and then back before 6am the next morning so we can feed them, recognizing that we have responsibility to these dogs. Of course we agree, if he's willing to do all the leg work of driving down and back, we would love to go, so the plan stands, as of the Sunday the 30th, that we will drive down and back all before the dogs need attention. \n\nWake up the morning of the 31st, low and behold, light dusting of snow and temperatures that aren't going to break the 10's, causing me to be wary. The weather continues on for most of the day, I decide to invite friend A over for lunch to discuss the plan, because I am cautious of going when the roads are going to be bad, weather advisories have already been called for some of the surrounding highways, and the temperatures are going to be deadly low. He comes over and I soon mention that I dont think it makes sense to go tonight, due to mainly the road conditions and our responsibility to the dogs. Mind you, the roads were indeed slick, I had just been to the grocery store and had experienced icy patches already. He immediately gets irate, saying that we always seem to have an excuse, demanding a rational for why we didn't want to go beyond just not feeling comfortable being in a car at these conditions. He kept saying that he got new snow tires and it would be fine, to which I responded saying Ice doesn't give a shit if you have new snow tires. He then followed up with saying \"Your decision not to come really says something about where your priorities are at\" and \"This may be the last time we see all of our friends in one place\" which most certainly isn't true (Everyone is in town till at the latest, the 12th). His arguments seemed to revolve heavily around guilt-tripping and a peer pressuring tactic, mentioning how everyone will be pissed with us if we bail. Our overarching reason for not wanting to go was not wanting to be on the roads when the conditions are shitty and our driver will be tired, however, we were the assholes for bailing on them because of our previous responsibilities. While we may of talked about throwing a party for new years eve, I was unaware of what the dog sitting would entail nor what the road conditions would be, yet he took it very personally, like we didn't want to hang out with him of the rest of our friends, when we tried to make it as clear as possible that it had everything to do with us being responsible for these dogs but more importantly not wanting to be on the unnecessarily.

Our first semester of our first year we were awesome friends having lots of fun. Even in highschool we were very close! The second semester, we began drifting apart. I would try to talk to her and she kinda talked down to me and made me feel like crap. When she wouldn't talk down to me, she would hide in her dorm (we had suites). So we didn't talk since college. (about 6 months) Last semester (my second year 1st semester) she asks me out of the blue if I would go to her wedding and wear a dress. Not really thinking, I said \"sure! Just talk to me more okay, I miss you!\" She said she was busy and that's why she didn't message me. I decided that college was college and before it we were awesome friends in HS &amp; first semester so maybe we just weren't a good roommate match. So for the past few months I've sent her messages and she just responds with one word or makes excuses when I ask if she wants to hang out. I'm like \"how come you never message me and when we do talk I have to initiate it?\" She says because she's in school or has to work and even was \"cleaning\" one time. She's ALWAYS busy. I get being busy, I work 2 part time jobs and go to college FULLtime. I make time for people I care about. I thought maybe we weren't good as roommates but we could be friends again that's really why I agreed. I thought her wedding would be good for us to start talking again and I could be a friend to support her.\n\nI feel like it's an asshole move to say yes then bail, I also feel like it's a jerk thing to have time for other people (goes on fancy trips with other friends) and expect me to go support you when you don't do anything to keep this friendship going.

We were friends since before I even started dating Mary, but the thing is, Mary hated her.\n\nShe  hated her with a burning passion, She'd wish death uppon her several times, called  her a Whore, a Slut, and several other things, but  Rebecca had no idea of this, since these 2 never even talked.\n\nOne  day, Mary and I had a fight about my  friendship with Rebecca.

I feel like my GF is self centered in a lot of ways and takes advantage of my kindness and somewhat uses me. \n\nA few examples of what I mean\n\n- Last night she was watching Netflix on our Smart TV and her legs were hurting so she wanted to do some stretching. She handed me the remote and asked me to find her yoga. Not a big deal there, I happened to hear a yoga program a few days ago that is one of those like 8 week mapped out programs with videos included. After the video she says I'm going to try to do this every day, cool, works for me. I told her I'll find the programming guide for her so she can see what videos she should watch every day. She tells me \"no you can just put the video on and tell me okay this is what you're doing.\"\n\n- She absolutely refuses to take partial responsibility to try and remember to take her birth control. I have to get it for her every night or else she doesn't/forgets to take it. Sometimes, even if I verbally remind her to go take it, she has me get it for her. I ask her why doesn't she make an effort to remember to take it herself and why is it always on me, she responds with \"it isn't always on you, you give it to me and I take it\"\n\n- When she goes to bed she will always ask me to set her alarm for work on her phone and plug it in. This especially annoys me when she literally hands me her phone when shes done browsing Facebook or whatever and then asks me to do this. I understand it if her phone is on the dresser or something and I'm walking by and shes already in bed, but that to me is ridiculous. \n\n- We don't often go to bed at exactly the same time (I'm full time getting my masters in CS, she works full time, I usually go to bed about an hour later or so) but sometimes when we do and I'm already in bed messing around on my phone or whatever and she is getting out of the shower she will get in bed without turning the light off and ask me to turn it off and turn on the fan. I usually make a big deal about this whenever it happens and ask her if shes serious...\n\nI don't want it to come off as she treats me as her slave and just bosses me around all the time, I just feel that I get punished for my kindness, because all of these things (and others like it) I have done at some point not because I was asked, but just to be nice and it seems once I do something to be nice a couple of times it seems like its just expected that \"oh okay this is your job now\" and it just kind of frustrates me. \n\nWIBTA if I brought up that I feel like I have a child rather than a GF? Obviously I would NOT phrase it this way, but that is honestly how I feel especially with stuff like the birth control and the alarm.", "output": "yes", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

POST :      Aight so pretty much from like grade 4 I\u2019ve always been really good at KINDA fitting into every group of friends I could find but never all the way being the same as them so I\u2019ve always had a lot of problems making actual friends. But I found a group I fit in better than most other ones, but they\u2019re all white. ( I\u2019m black and was  one of the very few coloured people at my elementary school) so every sleepover/ time we\u2019d hang out they\u2019d try out all their racist jokes and just say things I didn\u2019t agree with at all but by this point I had been with them for almost a year and was completely outnumbered by white people who think racism / racist jokes or comments are the funniest thing in the world, so I kinda just went with it. \n\nThese are still most of the people I talk with in high school, with the addition of several others similar to them and one Friend who I genuinely considered to be my best and closest friend who I\u2019ll refer to as V. I used to be very very ugly and fat in grade 9, as well as desperate for approval/ friends. So all these people I\u2019ve known for a long time used that to get me to go do stupid and really embarrassing things and they recorded all of them. The next two years (currently grade 11) they\u2019ve been holding those videos against me and threatening to send them out to people if I didn\u2019t do shit for them, just basically being huge dicks and acting like they\u2019re just playing around and everything is hilarious and we\u2019re such great friends. But anyways I\u2019ve been asking V non stop the last year to delete the videos or to keep them to himself ( he was the one with the majority of the videos a couple others did the same thing with ones they have ) and he said that he won\u2019t delete them, but he also won\u2019t send them to people.\n\nBut in the last week I\u2019ve been sent the videos and made fun of by 6 different people, and in my English class (this is a class I have a different friend group in, as well as 2-3 from the group of dicks ) one of the kids from the group of dicks (I\u2019ll call him D) came over to the group and asked \u201cdo you guys want to see some videos of *****\u201d and I knew what he was about to do so I tried to take his phone, resulting in D running to the other side of the class and sending it to everyone he could, including those in the class, and i watched every single person in my English room open the videos and laugh at / make fun of me before airdropping the videos to every phone they could reach. At the end of the class D told me that V had sent the videos to multiple groupchats with 25+ people where they all made fun of me more. I was pissed and I was going to beat his ass but D like literally sprinted to his next class and kept acting like everything bout this was a big joke while I\u2019m still getting made fun of by people in the halls for it.\n\nThen I finish the day and go home, already in a terrible mood, feeling way more depressed than usual, feeling completely powerless and suicidal, and about two hours later I got a message from a school friend I don\u2019t even talk to laughing at me and making fun of me on Instagram DMs with an attached Instagram story. V posted all the videos on his story with 900 followers and every single guy friend I have has seen it, plus I\u2019m already shit at talking to girls and not doing great in that department so this doesn\u2019t help that at all. I sent V a text and a message on Instagram telling him to take me off his story rn, both of which he leaves on read and keeps the video up. But he still wants to act like we\u2019re friends in person Nd everyone\u2019s making me feel like IM the asshole here for being mad and not thinking it\u2019s funny and saying I\u2019m overreacting Nd being a bitch when I\u2019m just sick of their shit\n\nSooo I just really need to know AITA right now for not wanting to talk to any of these people anymore? Because I really do not feel like I\u2019m overreacting \n\nEdit: tomorrow is a big trip to Quebec pretty much to party and do bare drugs and have sex n shit, Today V broke his wrist in gym class (bone sticking out and shit ) and will not be able to go on the trip.

I had moved in with some family out of state and was told everything was set. (Internet, food, power, jobs.) \n\n Surprise when I get there none of that was there. No one had a job. There was about 6 people living in a tiny trailer, 4 guys, 2 girls. Not including the people who would just drop by. For 850 a month (minus expenses). Only Me, my cousin, and my uncle were able to find work after a week or two.\nThen the main new guy \"moved in\" Maybe a month later. \n\n\n  At first me and my cousin shared a room but after a while of everyone hanging out in there I was told to \"move my bed to the kitchen so I can have some space.\" I didn't think much of it and did as I was told.\n\n \n I made a little blanket fort in the back of the kitchen so I could block out some light and get some sleep before work. I had gotten my first real job and wanted to do my best there.\n\n\n\nNow this new guy there was a worst influence then the family I moved in with.  He did some hard drugs and got my cousin back into smoking meth. Needless to say I wasn't the biggest fan of his. But he did help bring in some money  here and there, and was good friends with my cousin.  so I kept my mouth shut.\n\n\nHere's where the AITA comes in. \n\n\nAfter a month or so I got sick of this man. He was over all the time. Didn't pay rent and ate our very limited food. He would always reply with, \"once we (him and his mom, who also smoked meth) get our welfare we'll help out!\"  Even though he had a job painting doors.\n (Learned after I moved out he did get welfare and when he did he never came over again) \n\n\nAfter a night of drinking I had to sleep through for my job the next day, this man's phone alarm goes off, and no one gets up but me.  Normally I'm a nice guy, I would have woken him up but I was tired from there BS all night, had work later, and didn't really give a fuck about him at this point.\n\n\n\nAbout an hour of this 10 second loop of a metal song I Don't know plays before he finally gets up. Checking his phone he yelled, \"shit!\"  Before calling his boss.\n\n\n\nan hour late? yep, This man was fired.  \n\n\n\nI moved out a week or so later when my uncle told me that if I go back home to see my sick and dying grandpa to just move back in with my parents. So I did. \n\n Gandpap lived another 6 years :)\n\n\nTL:DR a junky who lived with us and got my cousin addicted to meth over selpt his alarm. I woke up and didn't wake him.

I have a strong inkling ITA, but needed to confirm, so please lay it out honestly.  \n\nFor the past couple weeks, a few friends and I have been planning a 2 week vacation overseas later this year. The group originally included, myself, my gf, and my friends Don and Michael. The four of us have been good friends for years now.\n\nNow Michael has been dating this girl, Melanie, for about a year and some change. We all like Melanie enough, she\u2019s a nice person, and treats everyone respectfully. However, it\u2019s been unanimously decided amongst not just us 3, but the entire friend group that Melanie is just *okay.* \n\nWhile she is a nice person, we have very different senses of humor, demeanor, and perspective. \n\nThat being said, we all still go out together, hang out together, and Michael brings Melanie to almost all of our functions and events, which is completely fine.\n\nHowever, Michael asked today if Melanie could join us on our vacation. Obviously we all said yes, as she\u2019s his gf and we all felt he was entitled to bring her. On top of that, my gf is also going, so how could I object. However, no one was exactly ecstatic about the situation.\n\nMy question is AITA for having negative feelings about Michael bringing his gf along with us on our 2 week vacation?\n\nMy thinking was that if I was spending a lot of money and going through the inevitable overseas travel pains and stresses, I\u2019d like to do so with the friends I originally planned with.

I work in retail to finance my life as a student. Since I have been working in retail for ages and even before I started my studies I am in a position where I sub for my boss in the evenings and thus am in a position of some responsibility. Now let's discuss my WIBTA situation:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks ago I worked with a much older colleague of mine who is working the registers (I'll call her Ms. Karen), while I am supervising the cash registers of our huge store. She was having a bad day, being at odds with my boss about how her breaks were handled that day, while I was having a great day and was in good spirits. When I am in a supervising position I like to check in with the people at the registers when no customers are around to know if they need stuff etc. sometimes this also ends with some casual conversation. As I was in a good mood and have a somewhat booming voice, I could tell that my casual conversation with some of my other colleagues were doing nothing to improve the mood of Ms. Karen, who has got more disgruntled by the minute. When she finally finished her shift, I was the one who took her to the back to finish up her cash register. When in the back I asked her if I was to blame for even worse mood. Since she didn't offer me an answer, I apologised in case I was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went on a 2-week vacation and when I came back today I asked my boss if Ms. Karen had complained about me. Ms. Boss answered that Ms. Karen had asked who was supervising one of her shifts and when she got an answer that didn't contain my name, she responded with an annoyed \"As long as it's not Mr. u/Erzlump\". Back in the day when I started there we actually got along great and she often told me that the place needed more people like me - so this total turn surprised me. Now since my Boss and she do not get along very well (while my boss and I do), my Boss did not pay a lot of attention to her response - but the reaction could, of course, have been a lot different.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow the WIBTA Part: Tomorrow her shift will just be ending as mine begins, giving me a good chance of meeting her in the back. It really irks me that I asked her if she had a problem with me, yet received no answer, only to then find out that she now openly displays her resentment towards me in front of my Boss to the point where she says she prefers not to work with me at all. The thing is that if I asked here \"Hey, Ms. Karen, why do you not want to work with me anymore\" there could be other people present and she could that it as if I am trying to embarrass her. However, maybe she just said it as a joke and I want to give her a chance to tell me directly what's her problem. As our store (and relationship) are set up, I will have no real chance of talking about this to her with just the both of us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - WIBTA if I asked my colleague why she does not want to work with me anymore?", "output": "yes", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

She won\u2019t brush her hair because she\u2019s afraid it will fall out. She won\u2019t change clothes. She has nightly rituals that go on for hours. She won\u2019t flush the toilet etc. When my mom try\u2019s to help my sister will get manipulative and scream that she (my mom) doesn\u2019t love her and that she hates her. Which breaks my mom.

POST : I'm a 28 y/o male and in my immediate family I have all women, mostly this is because I was raised by my mother and have no contact with my father's side of the family due to a messy divorce when I was young. My two sisters (early 30s), my three aunts (two who are my mother's sisters and one married in to the family and married my aunt), and they have an assortment of close friends of the family all of which are women that also go to these events. \n\n\nAbout 3 years ago, my mother had an idea to do a 'girls only' weekend. Originally this was to see one of the Magic Mike movies, and because it was such a hit they started to do these weekend outings once or twice a month. Originally it didn't bother me, because I'm an adult and I have my own life, and my own house, and I really didn't even think about it. But an incident recently made me annoyed at the whole concept. My aunt's birthday was in January and normally we go to her favorite restaurant for her birthday, which also incidentally is my favorite restaurant. So I bought her a present and a card, and waited for an invitation and none came. \n\n\nWhen I asked what was going on for her birthday, I was told they celebrated it early on their girls day because she was going to be out of state during her birthday. This kind of irked me because when I mentioned I bought her a present my mother told me to just drive over to her house and give it to her. I felt pretty left out since I am the only male in my immediately family, having a 'girls day' is the equivalent to saying 'hey let's celebrate my birthday but not invite him'. \n\n\nI griped about and was told that I was basically being self centered and that she can celebrate her birthday however she wants. I agree with that, but once again, I'm the only one being left out and it feels shitty. The proverbial straw that broke the camel's back was I was just also just informed that they were planning a summer vacation this year as 'girls only' too, and when I asked my mother what about the vacation we normally take as a family, she told me that they can't afford to do both so they are just doing the girls only vacation this year. \n\nAt this point I was VERY annoyed and had a loud argument with my mother and sister, telling them that it's really shitty that twice a month they have group activities and specifically exclude me, and on top of that are now even taking vacations and excluding me. Nothing came of the argument and they wouldn't budge, so I decided I needed a break from my immediate family because they don't consider my feelings relevant. So I removed myself from the family group chat and deactivated my Facebook. Now my phone is being blown up and I'm being told that I'm immature and I need to grow up. I responded that a lot of grown people don't see much of their family at all and I'm just going to follow that example. \n\n\nAm I the asshole here?

It\u2019s brash, unspecific and general, but I\u2019m afraid I have a severe lack of knowledge on different syndromes and disabilities and I am unable to specify which disorder her daughter lives with. It does not appear to be a physical disability. \n\nA bit of background: I\u2019m a customer assistant at the local shop where I live. I\u2019ve worked here for over a year, and I\u2019m generally praised for my communication skills with our customers and I often receive positive feedback from customers themselves. I like working there and I like the customers (apart from the odd few, but y\u2019know, retail). \n\nOur shop is very small and only ever has 2-3 people working a shift at one time. This means we get to know our customers on a reasonably personal level. This woman and her daughter come in to the shop often as they live nearby. They initially made a point of getting to know everyone by name, which I appreciated as it was friendly. But they continued to get closer. The mum will come in with her daughter (who is around 24, and a very sweet girl, but is very attached to her mum and will do anything she says), and will say to her daughter \u2018oh look, _____ is working, to give him/her a hug\u2019. This happens very often and not all staff are comfortable with this, particularly some of the males, but we are all often afraid to say no. \n\nFurthermore, the mum began asking, on her daughters behalf, if we could add her (the daughter) on Facebook/WhatsApp so she could have friends. One of my colleagues felt too awkward to say no and now the daughter messages her 24/7, comments on all of her Facebook posts, and proceeded to find all other social media through her Facebook. She posts statuses saying \u2018_____ is my best friend\u2019 and tags my colleague. The mum will also say \u2018there\u2019s your best friend\u2019 or even \u2018there\u2019s your sister/brother\u2019 to her daughter and point to members of staff, and I even heard her refer to my boss as her daughters dad. This makes the daughter believe she is much closer to the staff than she really is. \n\nHer mum has begun to walk straight into the office at work, which even the customer assistants are not allowed to do, because she believes her and her daughter are on close terms with our staff. We are all far too uncomfortable to tell her no for fear of discrimination. Her mum is also very touchy with staff, for example, stroked my boss\u2019s beard and told him he needed to shave. The next time they were in, her daughter did the same, because she has obviously seen her mum do this and assumed it was appropriate behaviour.\n\nToday, they came into the shop, and told me they liked my hair. The mum asked me if I could come round to their house for a \u2018girls day\u2019 and do her daughters hair. Her daughter became so excited and asked for my phone number to arrange this. The mum said she\u2019d make lunch and take us out afterward. I understand that it just be hard for her that her daughter doesn\u2019t have friends, but this is not the way to help her make them. I very so awkward and under a lot of pressure, that I claimed I was super busy over the next couple weeks.

POST :  \n\nHey,\n\nSo a quick summary:\n\nI'm in a relationship with my boyfriend, it was wonderful at the start, then things became bad, he started to control me because of my past, accused me of actively cheating, calling me names for my past, being aggressive towards others. Then I wanted to break up and started flirting with another guy and fooled around with him, which was ABSOLUTELY a bad idea and I have told my boyfriend about that and we agreed to stay together, but so his accusations and calling me names continued. I'm not bad about that, it's still something I am unhappy about but it's my fault.\n\nSo that's the situation, and here how it's now, some months later:\n\nHe keeps on saying I'm cheating, often when I go to work, during work or when I come back. He can see where I am, and because of gps which is not always accurate, he calls me and says \"where are you, you're fucking with him right?\", etc and when I'm not answering, it's getting a lot worse. But I'm telling me here, I did this, it's my fault, I have to accept it.\n\nWhat I'm annoyed about is that his mood can change so suddenly, which also happend before I cheated. One moment we are happy and joking, I look at him and hes like \"you fucked someone today right?\", and then starts to call me asshole etc.\n\nAlso I'm saying myself I have to accept that he's calling me names etc, but it does hurt, and I'm thinking of the future and I know he will never stop doing that, so what's the sense of staying with someone I've hurt so much that he will torture me my life with calling me names and sometimes being aggressive towards me?\n\nSomething unrelated to the cheating, he is often fighting with other people. When something is not right, he shouts at them. We have a neighbour, who is blocking the entrance for our car, and he instantly gets aggressive, calls him names, shouts at him etc. I tried to talk with the neighbour, but he was getting aggressive towards me for talking with him and trying to discuss the problem. This is the same for anything where someone is not agreeing with him, shouting at him, calling them names etc. He even did this in front of the police once.\n\nI feel like I'm living with an antisocial person, and this makes me feel bad about myself and how other look at me.\n\nI would have left already if this would be always like this, but it's not.\n\nWhen we're at home, it's all fine, we have some fun together, we can laugh and cuddle. But if something is not alright, like me not cleaning up the room but instead playing games or me not giving him a kiss when he comes back, he's angry and either shouts at me or ignores me and I'm wondering, what his problem might be. That's his favorite two things, either being aggressive and calling me names, or ignoring me and making me wonder what I did wrong again.\n\nAnd another moment, he's laughing, making fun of what just happend and kisses me. I'm totaly confused by this and can't make my mind up.\n\nI'm thinking of breaking up but I just can't because it's not always this bad, and I fear that if I tell him that I'll break up with him, he cries and says that everything was a joke and that he loves me and then I can't say no.\n\nI feel like that I went to early into this relationship, that I did not get to know the whole site of his. Now I see him being antisocial and aggressive towards neighbors and his family and it's also affecting me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what I want to know is  \n\n\nAITA if I break up with him now, or do I deserve it because I cheated?  \nOr AITA for not breaking up with him, because I do not deserve him?", "output": "no", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

He heads out and locks the door behind him... she calls him back in and takes his apparent second key. \n\nI asked at the beginning if john and her had a past, she told me she kissed him once while they were drunk. I know I\u2019m an asshole for doing this, but I went thru her phone and found out they had been together before her and I were. I told her immediately what I had done, but that I didn\u2019t appreciate her lying. \n\nThey still text and call daily, which makes me very uncomfortable. I\u2019ve tried to express this to Jane but she doesn\u2019t seem to get it. I am untrusting of john and it makes me occasionally untrusting of Jane. We\u2019re planning on moving cross country in a few months, but I can\u2019t handle him around now.. I just want him out.

POST : Here's the situation, I'm a 14 year old in 8th grade, and It's after school, me and my friends walk in our usual routine, There are 3 other friends walking with me, Kent, Tyler, and Terry. Me and Kent talk about Terry, I bring up the time we said Terry had no neck (Terry is fat), Terry overhears. I need to do some more explaining for this, we're all part of a group of 9 or so friends who poke fun at each others, and others flaws, none of us take it seriously, it's just teasing, but, we always make sure we have the friend hear what we say, as we don't like to talk shit behind backs. Lots of times, there is some friendly roughhousing involved like piling on top of each other, or tackling one another, etc.. We each try not to cause harm, and if we do, it's purely accidental, as when we go too far, we make sure to ask if they're okay, or if they know it's just a joke. we apologise to each other if we know we went far. As I was saying, I say Terry has no neck, Terry started Hitting Kent's backpack with a stick as a joke Kent told Terry I said it, and started hitting my backpack as a joke, and hit my upper leg with the stick lightly. My mom picks me up at this spot, Terry and I laugh it out, but my mom See's this. as I get in the car with Terry (as he needed a ride) my mom tells Terry, \"Don't do what you don't want other's to do to you\" in Spanish. Terry does not understand Spanish, but Kent most likely does. As I walked into the car, Tyler Tells me what is going on. as a teen, I don't like other's standing up for me, I'm 14, not 5, we know the boundaries. I tell my mom, it was a joke, hoping for her to understand. Instead she and I have an argument where I try to explain my side. This goes on with how you expect it to, my mom argues that I can't let myself Be taken \"bullied\" of like that, while I tell her it was a joke, while Tyler is next to me is laughing quietly. After Tyler leaves at his house, me and Mom argue worse than before, since Tyler left, I was able to say things to my mom like, \"I hate it when you think I'm five\" and she would talk about how \"Tyler should have heard this to know that you're not comfortable with being pushed around\" I'm pretty mad at this, because I know that it's pure jokes (it's really just jokes).  This goes on and on, She treats my argument Like a joke, so when I brought up points like how when Kent sprayed ketchup on me on accident, he apologized. all she replied with was \"Uh huh\" and never acknowledged it, but It was just an accident. Even worse is my dad told me that it would escalate from accident, into a fight. I explained the generosity of my friends, and how they say sorry, he said that's a lie. We argued, I tried being serious to my mom about it, by telling her I'm not a child anymore. she didn't take me seriously. They think I can't defend myself at all, although they're just trying to protect me.

I moved in with friends and they come from difficult backgrounds. I'm conflicted because they're actually good, ambitious, hardworking people and care about me, but I want to be around people who are, I guess in my terms, better. I'm uncomfortable with how the guys talk about women. One always complains about how he never gets dates, that people don't want to hang out often enough, that people work too much, and complains about the girls who have rejected him but he still crushes on them. I've been realistic with him on what he can do to change his situation, but he doesn't try clubs, change how he looks to be more attractive, etc. Another comments on how attractive other girls who are at least 6 years younger than him are even though he has a girlfriend. He actually hit on me before when I had a boyfriend, which I thought was trashy. The other brags about stuff like how he used to date a girl who was a D-cup.  One girl jokes about how her dad cheated on her mom and she doesn't expect her own relationship to last. That's not them as a totality, but I just don't like that these are the type of people I decided to live with and I like myself less because of it. I don't want myself to get used to this being the norm and this isn't helping the bias against guys I have from growing up seeing the men in my family cheat. I even recently found out a cousin broke up a marriage in a messed up way and I'm sick of feeling like I can't run away from this pattern. My main reason is that I just don't want to think this is what I should expect from people and I expect better. They seem to have just accepted their life and what they saw growing up, but I want to surround myself with people I can be proud of. I'm not perfect either and I don't want to sound like I'm better than them, but I'm just really disappointed right now. ", "output": "yes", "category": "Ethics Classification 1129.json"}]
