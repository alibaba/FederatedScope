REVIEW METHODS Randomised trials that compared ultrasound imaging with standard methods (no imaging) in the performance of a lumbar puncture or epidural catheterisation were identified.   \n RESULTS 14 studies with a total of 1334 patients were included (674 patients assigned to the ultrasound group, 660 to the control group). Five studies evaluated lumbar punctures and nine evaluated epidural catheterisations. Six of 624 procedures conducted in the ultrasound group failed; 44 of 610 procedures in the control group failed. Ultrasound imaging reduced the risk of failed procedures (risk ratio 0.21 (95% confidence interval 0.10 to 0.43), P<0.001). Risk reduction was similar when subgroup analysis was performed for lumbar punctures (risk ratio 0.19 (0.07 to 0.56), P=0.002) or epidural catheterisations (0.23 (0.09 to 0.60), P=0.003). Ultrasound imaging also significantly reduced the risk of traumatic procedures (risk ratio 0.27 (0.11 to 0.67), P=0.005), the number of insertion attempts (mean difference -0.44 (-0.64 to -0.24), P<0.001), and the number of needle redirections (mean difference -1.00 (-1.24 to -0.75), P<0.001).   \n CONCLUSIONS Ultrasound imaging can reduce the risk of failed or traumatic lumbar punctures and epidural catheterisations, as well as the number of needle insertions and redirections.

PI3K inhibitors thus have considerable potential as molecular cancer therapeutics. Here, we detail the pharmacologic properties of a prototype of a new series of inhibitors of class I PI3K. PI103 is a potent inhibitor with low IC50 values against recombinant PI3K isoforms p110alpha (2 nmol/L), p110beta (3 nmol/L), p110delta (3 nmol/L), and p110gamma (15 nmol/L). PI103 also inhibited TORC1 by 83.9% at 0.5 micromol/L and exhibited an IC50 of 14 nmol/L against DNA-PK. A high degree of selectivity for the PI3K family was shown by the lack of activity of PI103 in a panel of 70 protein kinases. PI103 potently inhibited proliferation and invasion of a wide variety of human cancer cells in vitro and showed biomarker modulation consistent with inhibition of PI3K signaling. PI103 was extensively metabolized, but distributed rapidly to tissues and tumors. This resulted in tumor growth delay in eight different human cancer xenograft models with various PI3K pathway abnormalities. Decreased phosphorylation of AKT was observed in U87MG gliomas, consistent with drug levels achieved. We also showed inhibition of invasion in orthotopic breast and ovarian cancer xenograft models and obtained evidence that PI103 has antiangiogenic potential. Despite its rapid in vivo metabolism, PI103 is a valuable tool compound for exploring the biological function of class I PI3K and importantly represents a lead for further optimization of this novel class of targeted molecular cancer therapeutic.", "output": "False", "category": "Text Quality Evaluation 685.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

Multivariate analysis controlling for potential confounding baseline variable was undertaken for the measured outcomes. All subjects, within the low vitamin D and low PTH group following the magnesium loading test had evidence of Mg depletion [mean(SD) retention 70.3%(12.5)] and showed an increase in calcium 0.06(0.01) mmol/l [95% CI 0.03, 0.09, p=0.007], together with a rise in PTH 13.3 ng/l (4.5) [95% CI 3.2, 23.4, p=0.016] compared to baseline.

Numerous studies have shown that H(2)S has vasodilator and antihypertensive effects in the cardiovascular system. However, intracellular mechanisms of the H(2)S-induced vasodilation and its interactions with other endothelium-derived relaxing factors, such as nitric oxide (NO), remain unclear. We investigated whether H(2)S directly regulates endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activity and NO production in endothelial cells. NaHS, a H(2)S donor, dose-dependently increased NO production in cultured endothelial cells. This effect was abolished by a calcium chelator (BAPTA-AM), but not by the absence of extracellular calcium. The NaHS-induced NO production was partially blocked by inhibitors of ryanodine receptor (dantrolene) or inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (xestospongin C). NaHS significantly increased intracellular calcium concentrations, and this effect was attenuated by dantrolene or xestospongin C. NaHS induced phosphorylation of eNOS at the activating phosphoserine residue 1179. The NaHS-induced eNOS phosphorylation and NO production were not affected by a PI3K/Akt inhibitor (wortmannin).

We also looked at their association with classical prognostic factors in EC. To our knowledge, this is the first time survivin expression is investigated in terms of its relation to COX-2 in the developmental pathway of EC.   \n METHODS Archived tissue samples of 50 EC, 30 endometrial hyperplasia and 20 proliferative endometrium were selected and immunohistochemically analyzed for survivin and COX-2 expression.   \n RESULTS Both survivin and COX-2 were overexpressed in hyperplasia and endometrial adenocarcinoma cases compared to proliferative endometrium, which was statistically significant (p=0.01, p=0.02, respectively). Among EC cases, survivin and COX-2 were strongly positive in 38 (76%) and 30 (60%) patients, respectively. Furthermore, we found survivin and COX-2 to be positively correlated, which was also statistically significant (p=0.0001, r=0.46). Neither survivin nor COX-2 expression was correlated with classical prognostic factors of endometrial carcinoma such as myometrial invasion, grade or lymph node metastasis (p>0.05). Neither COX-2 nor survivin had an impact on overall survival (p>0.05).   \n CONCLUSIONS Both survivin and COX-2 are overexpressed, and they seem to be early events in the occurrence of EC. Moreover, protein products of these two genes are positively correlated. COX-2 and survivin might share a common molecular pathway or enhance each other's actions in the developmental pathway of EC.

A clearer definition of the benefits achievable by interventions specifically focused on correcting maternal nutrition deficits should not be limited to improvements in the quality of maternal nutrition supplements, but on the cumulative quantity and timing of interventions (also recognizing the heterogeneity between populations).

STUDY SELECTION Randomised controlled trials that evaluated any dietary or lifestyle interventions with potential to influence maternal weight during pregnancy and outcomes of pregnancy.   \n DATA SYNTHESIS Results summarised as relative risks for dichotomous data and mean differences for continuous data.   \n RESULTS We identified 44 relevant randomised controlled trials (7278 women) evaluating three categories of interventions: diet, physical activity, and a mixed approach. Overall, there was 1.42 kg reduction (95% confidence interval 0.95 to 1.89 kg) in gestational weight gain with any intervention compared with control. With all interventions combined, there were no significant differences in birth weight (mean difference -50 g, -100 to 0 g) and the incidence of large for gestational age (relative risk 0.85, 0.66 to 1.09) or small for gestational age (1.00, 0.78 to 1.28) babies between the groups, though by itself physical activity was associated with reduced birth weight (mean difference -60 g, -120 to -10 g). Interventions were associated with a reduced the risk of pre-eclampsia (0.74, 0.60 to 0.92) and shoulder dystocia (0.39, 0.22 to 0.70), with no significant effect on other critically important outcomes. Dietary intervention resulted in the largest reduction in maternal gestational weight gain (3.84 kg, 2.45 to 5.22 kg), with improved pregnancy outcomes compared with other interventions. The overall evidence rating was low to very low for important outcomes such as pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, and preterm delivery.   \n CONCLUSIONS Dietary and lifestyle interventions in pregnancy can reduce maternal gestational weight gain and improve outcomes for both mother and baby.

This study examines intron and exon characteristics from annotations of whole genomes to investigate the intron recognition mechanism. Exon definition uses the exon as the unit of recognition, placing length constraints on the exon but not on the intron (allowing it a greater range of lengths). In contrast, intron definition uses the intron itself as the unit of recognition and thus removes constraints on internal exon length forced by the use of an exon definition mechanism. Thus, intron and exon lengths within a genome can reflect the constraints imposed by its splicing. This study shows that it is possible firstly to recover valid intron and exon information from genome annotation. We then compare internal intron and exon information from a range of eukaryotic genomes and investigate possible evolutionary length constraints on introns and exons and how they can impact on the intron recognition mechanism. Results indicate that exon definition-based mechanisms may predominate in vertebrates although the exact system in fish is expected to show some differences with the better characterized system from mammals.

MATERIAL AND METHODS We studied 123 postmenopausal women evaluated in the C.I.Parhon National Institute of Endocrinology, the Pituitary and Neuroendocrine Diseases department. All cases had been reffered for the evaluation of BMD by the general practitioner. The evaluation included serum measurements of total and ionised calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 25 hydroxi vitaminD (25OHD), parathyroid hormone (PTH), osteocalcin, betacrosslaps. Central DXA osteodensitometry was performed.   \n RESULTS 91.9% of cases had 25OHD serum levels below 30 ng/ml (74.8% had VD deficiency, 17.1% VD insufficiency). Only 8.1% had sufficient VD levels. A history of fragility fractures was present in 45.83% of the osteoporotic patients, 27.27% of the osteopenic ones and 15.15% of the women with normal BMD. 32 women (26%) were on VD supplementation at the time of evaluation. Among these subjects, the 25OHD level was significantly higher in those with prior fragility fractures (p=0.018) and osteoporosis (p=0.008). 25OHD concentration negatively correlated with PTH, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin. The bone markers evaluated had a significant inverse correlation with the radius BMD, T and Z scores (p=0.004). 27.17% of the cases with VD deficiency had secondary hyperparathyroidism. The 25OHD concentration was significantly lower in these cases (p=0.000).   \n CONCLUSIONS VD insufficiency is widely prevalent but still under-recognized and under-treated, possibly leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Previously, the Hunchback (HB) protein has been implicated in setting the anterior expression limit of the UBX homeotic protein in parasegment 6. Here we investigate DNA elements and trans-acting repressors that control spatial expression of the Abdominal-A (ABD-A) homeotic protein. Analysis of a 1.7-kb enhancer element [iab-2(1.7)] from the iab-2 regulatory region shows that in contrast to Ubx enhancer elements, both HB and Kr\u00fcppel (KR) are required to set the ABD-A anterior boundary in parasegment 7. DNase I footprinting and site-directed mutagenesis show that HB and KR are direct regulators of this iab-2 enhancer. The single KR site can be moved to a new location 100 bp away and still maintain repressive activity, whereas relocation by 300 bp abolishes activity. These results suggest that KR repression occurs through a local quenching mechanism. We also show that the gap repressor Giant (GT) initially establishes a posterior expression limit at PS9, which shifts posteriorly after the blastoderm stage. Finally, we show that this iab-2 enhancer contains multiple binding sites for the Polycomb group protein Pleiohomeotic (PHO). These iab-2 PHO sites are required in vivo for chromosome pairing-dependent repression of a mini-white reporter.

In the present study, we investigated whether ketamine inhibits release of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a late-phase cytokine of sepsis, in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages through heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) induction.   \n METHODS Macrophages were preincubated with various concentrations of ketamine and then treated with LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL). The cell culture supernatants were collected to measure inflammatory mediators (HMGB1, nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and interleukin 1\u03b2) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Moreover, HO-1 protein expression, the phosphorylation and degradation of I\u03baB-\u03b1, and the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 and nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) p65 were tested by Western blot analysis. In addition, to further identify the role of HO-1 in this process, tin protoporphyrin (SnPP), an HO-1 inhibitor, was used.   \n RESULTS Ketamine treatment dose-dependently attenuated the increased levels of proinflammatory mediators (HMGB1, nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, and interleukin 1\u03b2) and increased the HO-1 protein expression in LPS-activated macrophages. Furthermore, ketamine suppressed the phosphorylation and degradation of I\u03baB-\u03b1 as well as the LPS-stimulated nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB p65 in macrophages. In addition, the present study also demonstrated that ketamine induced HO-1 expression through the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 in macrophages. The effects of ketamine on LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokines production were partially reversed by the HO inhibitor tin protoporphyrin (SnPP).   \n CONCLUSION Ketamine inhibits the release of HMGB1 in LPS-stimulated macrophages, and this effect is at least partly mediated by the activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and NF-\u03baB suppression.", "output": "True", "category": "Text Quality Evaluation 685.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.
