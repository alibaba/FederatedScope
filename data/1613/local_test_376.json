Which of the following statements correctly describes a possible outcome of this reaction and why it would occur?\n(A)Conservation of mass indicates that if a single new particle were created in the reaction, it must have a total mass equal to the combined masses of the electron and positron. (B)Conservation of charge indicates that all new particles created in the reaction would have no electric charge. (C)Conservation of momentum indicates that two identical gamma rays moving off in opposite directions could be created. (D)Conservation of energy indicates that the antimatter positron could annihilate into energy, leaving the stationary electron behind.", "output": "C", "category": "Question Answering 1336.json"}, {"instruction": "You are given a question on high school physics.
