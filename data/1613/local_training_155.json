something like, \"i want to be a good person, and i don't think we need extrinsic motivations for being good. if i'm motivated by the threat of hell or the promise of heaven, then i'm not truly moral.\" i don't know how good that argument is, but i do know that i'm a moron for getting myself into this with a stranger at the park. i look up and there's another mom giving me the evil eye. i was basically implying that christian morality is shit and i'm way too good for it. it did end the conversation, but in the worst possible way. this lady, who thinks sitting on a park bench is an act of faith, suddenly needed to get back home. she had definitely understood the holier-than-thou-ness of what i said, and i think it was kind of a disorienting role reversal. so i was able to prove that there's no bigger sanctimonious asshole than a former christian.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nbut that's not even the end of it. my daughter ends up making friends with a little girl who wants to get our phone number. she brings her mom over and we exchange numbers. this little girl is actually in my daughter's class, and i'm really happy that they've hit it off. the mom then introduces me to her husband and friend. the husband leaves to load the kids up in the car. i recognize her husband from the ice cream shop near by. we were there like a week ago and i just happen to remember him because he had a baby and what seemed like a bunch of other small children with him. it seemed like a lot for one parent to handle, and i sypathized. anyway, i mentioned that i remembered him from the ice cream shop because he seemed like such a good dad. the mom said, \"he *is* a good dad!\" and i continued, \"and then i saw him on meet-the-teacher night, and i was like, there's that good dad again.\" it was quiet. i'm a woman, by the way. that seems relevant to the story. and meet-the-teacher night is when you go see the classroom and teacher for the first time. so it's a small classroom, and i recognized the guy. he seemed to recognize me too, or looked at me like i was familiar or something. the population of our city is well over 900k, and i remembered seeing her husband twice in the last week or so. i might as well have said, \"i stalk and lust after your husband.\" that's how it was interpreted. i'm happily married and her husband is like an average, middle-aged guy. he really just stood out as one man doing a heroic parenting job at the ice cream shop. i can't imagine having a whole brood of children and having to single handedly take them places. but this lady and her friend now think i'm like a young, hussy single-mom on the lookout for a good dad or something. i hate everything i say to people. \n\n\n\n\n**tl;dr my kid really needs to make new friends, and i skillfully alienated every parent i met at her kindergarten meet up.**", "output": "TIFU at my daughter's kinder playdate", "category": "Title Generation 1137.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text.

(the office is like a comfort food to me, i watch it very often, and it always can take my mind off of sadness or being unhappy. to explain exactly how sad and almost depressed i am right now, i will share the fact that in the past two years i have watched the office end to end 9 times.)\n\nso i start watching the office, and in no time i get to \"the episode\". this episode is \"casino night\" in season two, the episode of jim and pam's first kiss. i watched this episode through, and i had already known it was my ideal situation to happen with this crush of mine. delirious at 2 in the morning, depressed with my slowly moving life, and full of confidence after watching this episode of the office, i decided it was time to make a change.\n\nfor almost two months now, i have had a letter to her in my notes on my phone. it was everything i have ever wanted to tell her about how she made me feel in general, and included my feelings that i recorded on the spot sometimes when i was with her. this letter was something i have always wanted her to see, and resembled the \"tea cup letter\" that jim almost gave pam, but took back discreetly at the last second, and ended up giving her years later. he took it back knowing it was the wrong time to give her this, and gave it to her exactly when she needed it. this is not how it ended up going for me. \n\nin my confidence and need for a change in my life, i thought she would instantly fall in love with me after seeing how she made me feel, and that it was the perfect time to give it to her because she happened to conveniently be online at the time. i copied and pasted this unfinished letter that i had drafted over the past few months, and i hit send.\n\nit felt great to do this! i was at the happiest i had been all year, knowing she would feel the same way. this feeling lasted for just under a minute. her response to my letter was \"this is too much, i think we are best as friends.\" this broke my heart. i had worked up a year's worth of courage for this, and my huge slump-breaking action only piled on to how depressingly slow my life is moving. i could only get to sleep last night knowing that in doing that, the hardest part was behind me, and i would be saved from being embarrassed if i had done it in person (instead of online while depressed and delirious).\n\ni was so wrong in thinking i had saved myself from school-wide embarrassment if i had done it in person. my crush sent my message to some of her friends that night (i found this out when i went to an event and was mocked with carefully picked quotes from my personal letter).\n\nwell reddit, now my whole school knows the sentimental details of a relationship i thought i had, and the fact that in all my courage i was to scared to confront her in person, and i did it in an im. \n\nafter all of this, i'm only left wondering:\n-what do i do now?\n-how can i escape this depression that grows with every day?\n-what do i do to fix the lump in my stomach about facing my friends?\n\n*(thank you reddit for reading this huge story ending in my unwavering depression. please just say anything in the comments, i could use any advice i can get right now.)", "output": "TIFU By Asking Out My Crush In The Worst Possible Way", "category": "Title Generation 1137.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text.

 that's where the fu starts.\n\nthere was also a couple of generic boxes of tapes and drives i found at the back of the server room.  as they contain data, and i wasn't sure what, i was keen to burn them all, but turns out the company we hired the dumpster from (there was lots of garbage to get rid of) do data disposal (apparently just some sort of industrial shredder).  they came round to pick everything up late yesterday afternoon before i clocked off.  most of the hds, which we have used to store data for the last 5-6 years, also went inside a box (well, inside a rack then inside a box) to be transported to the new building.\n\ncome this morning.  i got in about 6 am.  i thought if i get a good start i might get my extra holiday days plus tomorrow off, before a manic monday helping everyone with their computers.  i open the boxes, which were transported over yesterday afternoon, and start to move the server crates.  all well and good.  except about 45 minutes ago i open the box with the hds in.  and was met with tape disks.  the last 5 years of my company's data, payroll, admin, plus the actual archived data, is gone.  backups, gone.  profiles, e-mails, all gone.\n\ni'm fucked reddit.  i now have 48 hours to figure out what the fucking fuck to do.  i'm left with some tape disks that i can't even read (the box with the tape drives in went out along with the hds), and about 40 hours before management are expecting to come in monday morning with the server humming along nicely.\n\njim and dave get here about lunchtime.  no idea how i keep this from them until then.\n\n \n\n*edit #1 (9.14):* company have called back on phone right now!\n\n*edit #2 (9.19):* the disposal company would not give me any info until i gave them the account number for the contract we used. gave me some bullshit about how it could violate any confidentiality or put any sensitive items at risk. it's garbage! so pissed. can't call anyone to get it otherwise they will know the mess i'm in. couldn't even get a yes or no as to the status of the boxes.\n\n*edit #3 (9.25):* going to re-pack the stuff i unpacked this morning, try to make it look like nobody was here, that can at least buy me some time when jim and dave arrive.  looking through laptop e-mails too to see if there's been any mention of an account number anywhere.\n\n*edit #4 (10.25):* when i was moving boxes around (put our stuff at the back of the piles so it should give us a few more minutes here today) i found a sheet with all the details on! going to give them a call back now. will update as and when i have more info about the next step.\n\n*edit #4 (10.35):* so. they don't do data disposal! at least not directly. the 'e-waste' as she called it is contracted out to some other company, who i have the details for and will call now. the stuff they collected was sorted and disposal/recycling has started, but the computers and hds have gone to this other company yesterday. she has no idea what they do. my info on the shredder was from the project lead. hoping it's wrong now. anyone work in the field who can let me know what you do?\nps i had no idea some people chucked away computers! jesus.\n\n*edit #6 (10.56):* i rang and got a message saying offices not open until monday at 9. taking your advice though reddit and driving down now in case someone's there. also sent a couple of e-mails. it's about a 2 hour drive away so this will be my last edit for a while. going to tell the guys it's a family emergency or something and they will have to set things up to begin with. see you soon...\n\n*edit #7 (11.13):* **fuck dave fucking knows fuck**\n\n*edit #8 (13.03):* burnt rubber to get here fast, whole place is locked up though. can't see anything out the back. trying the number again. any ideas before i start the drive back? spoke to dave too, it's not as bad as i thought. he is doing one of the hr girls though: http://imgur.com/8pz8jxq http://imgur.com/hpvc9da\n\n*edit #9 (13.11):* left a note under the door. hopefully someone gets in touch before monday morning. heading back now to figure out what to do with the rest of the fucking stuff. may have to explain to jim what the fuck is gong on but he doesn't need to know until i figure out what to do.\n\n*edit #10 (15.08):* i'm back now, dave and jim have only been here for about an hour, all the stuffs unpacked, asked them to do a lot of the cabling and i'll figure out my next step.  jim's been looking through the boxes for the hds.  the box of tape disks is in my trunk.\n\n*edit #11 (15.19):* maybe i should chuck jim in there instead of the tapes...this guy is seriously panicking wants to tell the higher ups. could i pin it on him?\n\n*edit #12 (15.42):* i pulled the fire alarm. that gives me a few hours to think about what to do. we're heading out for a few beers and food whilst this gets sorted. dave knows. i know. sofia knows. jim doesn't know. dave hasn't told anyone. but jim looking nervous.\n\n*edit #13 (16.39):* http://imgur.com/bnpejhv food and beers. dave is a genius. he suggested three rounds of this weird chinese liquor and now we're all a little tipsy we carry on and reveal it when he's too impaired to do anything bad. then we discuss our plan of action for tomorrow.\n\n*edit #15 (19.02):* **omfg**. the reason jim looked so worried is because some of those drives are full of coke. contents stripped out and then sells them on as an intermediary (he said who but not making this worse now, changed 'jim's name too). uses our safe so the stuff never goes through his place long, and no-one would suspect a thing. hell i didn't. there's 4 of them that were stored with the backup hds. it's ok tho. plan is now crash at jim's then to head back down tomorrow to the facility and find a way in. no one there to let us in means no one to stop us. we can fucking do this guys!\n\n*edit #16 (19.06):* fuck. so drunk already. fixed layout shit will update in the morning.\n\n*edit #17 (21.48):* hitting the sack now. jim had a 'friend' come over who dropped a sack of tools off, for tomorrow i guess. did not look happy. do not want to see him right now. dave has gone round to sofia's place, i'm sleeping on the couch.\n\n*edit #18 (04.13):* someone is banging on the door reddit. i'm scared. hungover and scared.", "output": "TIFU by throwing away the wrong box.", "category": "Title Generation 1137.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text.

there are so many people. my only choice is to wait until we passed through the city center and there were fewer people on the bus. so through the entire city center i sat in my own vomit waiting for my chance to get off. eventually, i decide to just go for it and i take my bag and hold it horizontally so as to minimize drippage. i think holding it horizontally made it worse as there was a lot of drippage indeed. i get the the bottom level, and get the hell out of there. people at the bus stop looked at my bag strangely, i walked just beyond the bus stop and placed my bag next to a trash can. i then snapped a quick [picture](http://imgur.com/a/gffrm) (keep in mind most of the nastiness is inside seeping out). \n\nfrom here all i had to do was get home, but how? how could i grab a taxi and stink it up to the point where no one else would want to ride in there for the rest of the day let alone put my infested bag in there. i stood next to the bus stop for a good 10 minutes working out my current predicament. eventually i decide to walk to a smaller road to try and get a taxi and attempt to put my bag in the back. this doesn't work as i couldn't find any taxis. then i see a large dumpster and wonder if i can carry all my books and laptop and dispose of my bag in there. when i went to unzip my bag, the horrid slime deterred me and i gave up that idea. eventually i decide just screw it, walk out to the main road and grab the first taxi. i put my bag in the back which the driver luckily didn't give a second thought. about 10 seconds after i told him where to go he starts waving his hand in front of his face and saying something about a dog. i just play dumb and mutter something about having stepped it garbage and apologize. he is probably super confused and keeps winding down the windows every 5 minutes. when we get home i paid the driver with a s$100 bill (didn't have anything else) and as he struggles to find change i thank him. his boot is probably gonna stink for a week. i feel bad but i've made it home. \n\n \n\nedit: spelling", "output": "TIFU by reading on the bus", "category": "Title Generation 1137.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text.

(i never missed a question, so by the end of the year i was letting the entire class cheat off of me to compensate for my lack of social skills.)\n\n\nanyway, this is the point:\n\none day i was sort of day dreaming when i could feel her touching my back. again, she was sort of crazy and i had shitty social skills, so i was cool with it. she grabbed my bra strap and messed around with it for a while, which i ignored. after about 5 minutes--during which time i surely could have stopped here--she undid my bra. i don't know how annoying this would typically be, but i was wearing a tight knit sweater which was a little bit see-through. the thinness of the fabric had not bothered me before, as both the shirt and my bra were white, but became very inappropriate once my bra started slipping off. i sort of held my tits in place for the rest of class, which was harder than it should have been because it did not fit me. i am incredibly petite, so getting straps short enough for my arms was hard for me as a stupid adolescent, and my breasts hadn't quite finished growing, which put a wrench in buying bras. anyway, without the hook in back, it slid completely off.\n\nobviously, i tried to get the hell out as soon as the bell rang. it was the last period, so i had to run to catch the bus. in a school 800 students over the building's maximum capacity, the buses left exactly five minutes after class ended. i mean, there are several thousand students in the halls at once--a sea of people, a veritable hall mosh pit--and they expected us to collect our shit and get from one end of the building to the other in 5 minutes. to hell with asking teachers questions or grabbing homework assignments. \n\njust as i leave, the teacher stops me to compliment me on my last essay. i come off as a bit of a jackass while i try to keep my bra in place and blow her off. it was just painfully awkward--her taking her time to me nice to me, me holding my breasts, trying to get the conversation to end. i eventually made the bus, but i was always afraid that the teacher thought that i was a rude pervert forever after.\n\n\ni would like to say i learned a lesson about personal space, but she later left painful hickeys on my arms during a similar situation.", "output": "TIFU By ignoring a classmate while she undid my bra in class", "category": "Title Generation 1137.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text.

to calgary from montreal and knew nobody living there other than my mom and my cousin. since i had no friends, i was regularly on tinder in an attempt to meet new people but more specifically, to get some lovin. i was going to live with my mom for the first little while, however her apartment got flooded, so we both moved in with my cousin. my first weekend in calgary, my mom went away on business trip, and warned me not to fuck up because i have a history of making some bad decisions.\n\ni matched a few people and started chatting with some. this one girl, let\u2019s call her \u201cstacy,\u201d messages me. we get to talking and eventually plan to meet up at a bar. i told her to choose the spot because i\u2019m new to the city.\n\ni get dropped off and immediately notice that the bar is very sketchy. i text stacy and we meet outside the bar for a smoke. upon first meeting her, i instantly noticed that she\u2019s a bit bigger than her pictures presented her as (not surprised) and that she had a questionable fashion sense (wearing unusual jellyfish-print leggings). i was dressed up pretty nicely, which instantly made me feel weird.\n\nas we are having a smoke, i notice she\u2019s talking really fast, and not just to me, but to everybody that was outside on the street. we finish our cigarettes and walk inside. as we walk into the bar she turns to me and says \u201cif i start acting really weird, it\u2019s because i dropped ketamine right before you got here.\u201d although i was skeptical of this development, i\u2019ve dabbled with drugs before, had a couple of beers in me, and basically decided \u201cfuck it, let\u2019s see where this takes me.\u201d\n\nwe grab drinks, and she literally couldn\u2019t talk about anything other than drugs, burning man, and photographing herself naked. i could tell the ketamine was really hitting her, as her words were coming out of her mouth much quicker than her thoughts. eventually, she says we should leave and we end up at her sister\u2019s place that she was house sitting for the weekend. we start fooling around in her sister\u2019s bed, i started to finger her, then she said \u201cput it all in.\u201d \n\ni reply \u201cwhat do you mean?\u201d\n\nshe then said \u201cput in all your fingers.\u201d \n\ni reluctantly proceed. after all fingers turn into fisting, she asks me if i\u2019m \u201cfeeling adventurous.\u201d i generally have an open mind about this type of stuff, but this girl was so crazy that i was genuinely worried about what was going to happen.\n\nshe asked me if i wanted a butt plug in my ass, to which i said \u201cno\u201d\n\nshe asked me if i was into nipple clamps, to which i said \u201cno\u201d.\n\nshe then suggests that we lay down a yoga mat in front of a full body mirror so that she can watch me have sex with her from behind. as this request didn\u2019t seem too crazy, i played along. as i began to fuck her, she was aggressively staring into my eyes the entire time. even when i broke eye contact, which was frequently, her dilated pupils would always find mine.\n\nafter a few minutes, her hand slipped forward, causing the enormous steel encased full body mirror standing in front of us to fall over and smash me directly in the forehead. to this day i have no idea whether this was on purpose or not. at this point i am majorly shaken-up, and i push the mirror (which did not break) off my head. as i do this my forehead started squirt-bleeding onto her back like i had exploded an artery. i was freaking out. she was freaking out. we were yelling at each other out of confusion for a couple of minutes. \n\nonce things calm down a bit, i ask her where her shower is so i can go wash the blood out of my head. she follows me into the shower and eagerly starts giving me a blowjob as i clean the blood off my face. although i wasn\u2019t pleased with the situation i didn\u2019t stop her. we eventually get out of the shower and she asks me if i want anything for the pain. forgetting that she is passionate about drugs, i say yes and she gives me two pills. without thinking, i take them and then ask her what she gave me, as i could tell it wasn\u2019t tylenol or advil. she replies \u201coh, just a couple of oxys.\u201d\n\ni figured getting mad was a waste of time. i just wanted to get dressed get my things and leave. she didn\u2019t have any band aids, so i improvised and taped a kleenex over the gash. as i went back to her sister\u2019s room where all my clothes were, the oxys hit me like a ton of bricks, so i laid down. her bed felt like a marshmallow cloud. i wasn\u2019t going anywhere.\n\nstacy eventually comes into the room and says \u201cnow, where were we?\u201d \n\nconfused, i replied \u201cwhat do you mean?\u201d \n\nshe said, \u201cbefore the mirror fell\u2026 i\u2019m not quite done with you.\u201d\n\nby this point i was exhausted, bleeding out of my head, and just wanted to pass out. she was very persistent about not being done with me so i eventually agreed to just lying there and letting her hop on and do all the work. i was trying not to fall asleep while she was having her way with me, but eventually i finished and collapsed into an oxy-induced sleep.\n\nthe next morning i wake up. i look around, there is blood everywhere. the room looked like a csi crime scene. her sheets, comforter, pillows and carpet were all white and the tissue that i had taped to my forehead came off at some point in the night = blood literally everywhere. at this point she is still asleep. clearly i am traumatized and wasn\u2019t trying to stick around, so i tip-toe around the bloody crime scene looking for my lost belongings. after i find most of my things i get out of there as quickly as possible, still bleeding out of my head due to the lost make-shift band-aid. i get in a cab hungover, with nothing covering the large open gash on my forehead. the cab driver turns around and without me saying a word, asks me if i want to go to the hospital. i gave him an approving nod and ended up getting five stitches and fucking up pretty hard.\n \nstacy texted me a couple of times after this to try and meet up. i

could you show me your drivers license please?\" etc etc. nothing special. he then smiles and says **joking** \"ok, thank you for your support and you can continue your drive, unless you have something hidden in your trunk\". we smiled and grandpa just had to say one of his stupid comments \"hahaha, of course not officer. except for the kalashnikov rifle of course\". and bam, thats when the officers mood changed directly from have-a-good-day-gentleman to what-the-fuck-did-he-just-say, looking pissed and concerned at the same time. and this all within seconds, while picking his gun and yelling \"get of this car immediatly and show me your hands!!!\" \n\ngrandpa started laughing even louder, thinking this was a joke, while i had the \"what the heck is happening\"-look on my face. but this guy was all serious and he continued shouting \"i said get out of the car immediatly\". i had already realized he was serious, not so grandpa. getting outside, he was already calling for support as i went on trying to tell him that my grandpa always makes jokes like these. he wouldn\u00b4t believe me, however and we were told to put our hands on the car while the other officer literally checked every inch of our car. it took a good half an hour but eventually they let us go warning that these are not the kind of jokes to make.\n\ni was annoyed, but as we started our ride soon enough (thanks good), i was not afraid of loosing our plane. grandpa looked at me and said \"sorry, i didn\u00b4t know these guys have no sense of humor\" and i answered \"whatever\". \n\neventually, we then arrived at the airport. it wasn\u00b4t full of people which was good and we managed to go through very fast. fast forward some time and we are sitting in our plane, waiting for the pilot to start the flight but nothing happens.\n\n10 minutes pass. 20 minutes. 30 minutes. nothing happens and then we heard the pilots voice saying \"dear passangers, we are sorry to tell you that the flight will delay a bit because of some tecnical problems.\" etc etc. i thought okay, nothing serious, when all of a sudden a steward came to our seats telling us \"excuse me gentleman, would you two please stand up and follow me please?\"\n\ni just thought \"what-the-actual-fuck\". why? we didn\u00b4t do anything, what was the reason for this? she answerd \"please just follow me, i will explain later\". so we stood up and went with her outside with our hand luggage, as we were asked to do so, when i realize there are like 5 or 6 cops (or airport security) with machine guns waiting outside. i dropped my jaw as i really couldn\u00b4t understand what the fuck was going on.\n\nthen one of them said (in a very rude tone) \"you sir (pointing at my grandpa), please open up your hand luggage\"\n\"but what is actually happening? why all this chaos? i\u00b4ve nothing special in this bag?\" my grandpa answerd. \"please open your bag now\".\n\nso he put his bag on the floor and opened it and another officer proceeded taking everything slowly outside and checking it. after a few seconds he seems to have found what they were looking for.......a fucking cigarette lighter shaped like a revolver (similar to [this one](http://www.ebay.de/itm/like/231720488044?ul_noapp=true&chn=ps&lpid=106))\n\nmy grandpa went all crazy, laughing like hell saying \"hahahah oh, i see now what may have caused all that shit\" and i was like \"omfg. never ever again\"\n\none cop even face-palmed himself and finally, we were allowed to go back to our seats and fly the fuck to italy, but they insisted they would keep the lighter and to avoid such things in future.....\n\n....i defininitely needed a fucking vacation after this day....", "output": "TIFU with the Cops TWICE on the same day thanks to my wife\u00b4s grandpa", "category": "Title Generation 1137.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text.

willard\u2019s, so we ordered takeout. i knew i wanted to get an open-faced sandwich \u2013 my go-to meal whenever it\u2019s on the menu \u2013 but couldn\u2019t decide between the turkey and the brisket. while the brisket sounded better at the time, i decided to go with the turkey because it would probably be a bit easier on my stomach. i gave my order to my coworker, who ordered for everyone over the phone and went to pick it up. when she returned with the food, she told me the restaurant didn\u2019t actually have turkey (why they didn\u2019t say that when she placed the order on the phone, i don\u2019t know) so she got me the brisket instead\u2026\n\nwithout traffic, my drive home is about 30 minutes, and with traffic it can take as long as an hour. i left my office at 6pm. everything felt fine as i pulled out of the parking lot, but about two minutes later, out of nowhere, the brisket tried to use the emergency exit. i was approaching a very important intersection: going straight through would lead to a gas station that may or may not have a bathroom; right would lead to a plaza with a subway and chipotle, among many other shops with public restrooms; and left would put me onto an access road leading onto the first of two major highways on my way home with nowhere to stop until i reached my apartment. i was tired from staying late at work, and really didn\u2019t feel like stopping to poop. i convinced myself that while it was pretty bad at the moment, it would probably come and go in waves, and i could ride it out until i got home like i had done so many times before.\n\nnow is a good time to mention i am no stranger to this situation. over the last few years, i have developed anxiety from finding myself in situations where i needed to poop but had nowhere to go. even if i didn\u2019t have to poop, knowing i wouldn\u2019t be able to poop if i needed to would make me need to poop. these anxiety poops were most prevalent in the car, as there is usually no readily available bathroom while driving. after so many close calls in the car, i began to keep a stash of plastic shopping bags in the mesh pocket behind my passenger seat, just in case\u2026 a last resort. the closest i had ever come to shitting in a plastic bag in my car was on my way to work one morning two summers ago, in a very similar situation \u2013 i had just gone through the last intersection with access to public restrooms before i got to the office, and found myself sitting bare-ass on a frantically placed plastic bag while driving 55 mph in four lanes of traffic (there was construction on the left shoulder and there was a barrier instead of a right shoulder, so no place to pull over). some one or some thing must have been watching over me that day, because as i was about to let loose all over the bag that was in no way covering the entire seat or enclosing my entire ass, enough gas came out to relieve the pressure just enough to make it the rest of the way to the office toilet. with that in mind\u2026\n\ni found myself on the access road leading to the major highway\u2026 the poop had subsided for a brief period, but then came back with a vengeance. without traffic, i was about 25 minutes from home, with nowhere to stop and poop without exploring a random exit. but like i said, it was 6pm on a thursday. my access road merged into a second access road, which then merged into the right lane of a three-lane highway with frequent traffic lights. rush hour traffic was so bad, i was at a standstill on the first access road. to my right were some shops, but they were back up the hill i had just come down, and the only way back would be to turn around on the shoulder and go the wrong way back up the one-way access road. it was at this point, sitting still in all of this traffic at the beginning of this long journey home, that i knew i was shit out of luck. i grabbed the bags from behind the seat and put them on the seat next to me. i was wearing dress clothes \u2013 a button down shirt, tie, dress pants, dress socks, and dress shoes. i undid my belt to ease the pressure \u2013 didn\u2019t help much. i took off my watch and rolled up my sleeves \u2013 i knew this was going to get messy. took the belt all the way off. i had stared fate in the eye so many times before, yelling \u201cnot this day!\u201d but it seemed that my day of reckoning was finally upon me. i put the flashers on and pulled over to the shoulder of the access road. i pulled my pants and underwear down to my thighs, rolled my shirt up my back, and began to slide the bag underneath. i knew from my last experience with the bags that i really had to carefully and precisely place the bag so that rather than sitting on it, i was sitting in it. i did the best i could. my sphincter, toned and hardened from holding back countless shit storms, not so dissimilar to leonidas\u2019s 300 spartans holding off thousands of persians, was growing weaker. at ease, old friend, at ease\u2026 then it happened.\n\nif you haven\u2019t shit yourself recently, let me tell you \u2013 it feels wrong \u2013 and i don\u2019t mean the feeling of relief shrouded in a sloppy veil of regret and disdain. rather than falling straight down into an open toilet, the way i was sitting was forcing the crazed butthole evacuation down and forward in the direction of my knees. in addition to that, i wasn\u2019t sitting very high off the bag/seat. both of these factors caused this brisket bomb to explode all over my ass, taint, and the back of my legs. the feeling of poop mushing up against the lower part of your buttcheeks is such an unnatural feeling that nobody should ever have to feel. it was so wet and mushy, and it came it pulses \u2013 the only way i can describe it is like a soft serve ice cream machine spewing out the last bit of ice cream, leaking out in mushy pulses with the occasional somewhat solid glob. \n\nwhen it was all over, i carefully pulled the bag out and noticed a pile of poop in it \u2013 at least i had caught some of it. i put that bag in another bag to keep it from breaking or leaking. i found some napkins nearby and did one full-palmed wipe, and that napkin was soaked. top to bottom and side to side. i put that in the poop bag, tied it up, then triple bagged it. i did get some poop on my finger while wiping, so i put on some hand sanitizer \u2013 i had bigger issues than a little poo on my finger. my ass, grundle, and legs are still soaked in my own shit. keep in mind i\u2019m still sitting in stop and go traffic, so there are other cars literally right next to me \u2013 anyone in a truck or suv could easily look down into my sedan and witness these horrors unfolding \u2013 but that was the least of my worries. i knew i would have to sacrifice my undies to protect my pants and car seat. i pulled them up with my pants, and just felt them absorb the wet poop covering that area - you\u2019ve never truly had swamp ass until you\u2019ve driven 30 minutes sitting in your own diarrhea.\n\ni composed myself and got back on the road. while situated at a traffic light, i tried to shimmy around to see if the bag had done its job or if i had gotten any poop on the seat. while the car was in park as i was shitting, i was still in drive at this point, so without thinking, my foot left the brake and i nearly rear-ended the car in front of me as i was checking to see if i had shit on my car seat. i hit the brake just in time, and narrowly avoided an extremely awkward encounter \u2013 getting out of my car to consult the driver of the car i just hit, covered in my own shit. although, i would like to think there are still some good people in this world, and that they would have understood, or at least took some pity on the poor soul who just shat in a bag in his car.\n \ni didn\u2019t see any poop on the seat, and was finally good and on my way, and the worst of it was over\u2026 or so i thought\u2026 about 10 minutes away from my apartment, the feeling came back. i\u2019m already covered in my own shit, sitting next to a bag of my own shit, and need to shit again. only this time, i\u2019m out of bags. the bags, my contingency plan, were meant as a last resort. i hoped i would never have to use them in the first place, but never considered the scenario where i had already used them and needed more\u2026 i considered my options. i couldn\u2019t go into a building to use a public restroom, because i was literally covered in my own shit and didn\u2019t know what sort of damage my pants had taken. i had a raincoat on the floor next to me, but didn\u2019t want to poop in that. since i didn\u2019t have anything else to poop in inside the car, i could pull over and poop outside the car, but i was on the highway and there weren\u2019t many wooded areas i could go into. i decided against creating a poop shield with both the front and back passenger doors because it would be too difficult and messy to squat on the side of the road with diarrhea. my only option, after already shitting in a bag in my car and sitting in my own shit smoothie\u2026 was to just shit my pants.\n\ni was wearing tight underwear that really hugged my thighs, so i had to think about where the poop would go if it filled the underwear up and overflowed. i pulled my pants and underwear up a bit higher to prevent spillage out the back. i knew that if i were to shit my pants and walk anywhere, it would undoubtedly run down my legs, so to avoid it spilling out of my pants onto my shoes, car floor, or the carpet of my apartment, i tucked my pant legs into my dress socks \u2013 this is tough to do with one hand while driving. i drove through the pain and made it to the last major traffic light \u2013 from here it was one more light, then the home stretch down my road. i needed to turn right, and was the only one in the right turn lane, but traffic was so thick that i couldn\u2019t find a gap to go right on red. at this point, i needed to poop so bad that my sphincter and penis were both literally throbbing in rhythm. it was as if the time i sat on the bag in four lanes of 55 mph traffic, the time i was with a friend in his dad\u2019s truck and had to ask to stop at 2 gas stations and a rite-aid before finally finding a bathroom at a dunkin donuts (after already asking, stopping, and pooping at another dunkin donuts about 10 minutes earlier), and the time i had the ghost pepper sauce at buffalo wild wings and drove home, were all just practice for my sphincter, leading up to this very moment. since i couldn\u2019t find a gap, i was watching the crosswalk timer in front of me, counting down from 18, to try to perfectly time the light change. when it got to 0, it started over. it did that three times. i was screaming and banging on the steering wheel, and literally whimpering. i finally found a gap and got into the left turn lane at the next light, a big line of cars in front of me. the light changed, and i didn\u2019t give a fuck what color that left turn arrow was when i got to it, i was making it through that light. i got through, and was on my road, just over a mile to go. then all of the cars in front of me stopped. there was a bus in front of me that was stopping on and off. more screaming and banging on the steering wheel ensued. do i bargain with the devil, or can i make it one last mile\u2026 traffic finally cleared and i sped to my parking lot. i ran inside and just made it to the toilet. i finally purged myself of this wretched demon, as pure liquid came bursting through the tattered flood gates. bits of poop that had been drying on my ass for 30 minutes flaked off on the seat. i started wiping and it was like trying to mop up juice with cardboard. i stood up and looked at myself in the mirror \u2013 everything from my beltline to a few inches down the back of my thighs was covered in a yellowish brown shit. i got in the shower and cleaned up \u2013 then it was time to assess the damage. i didn\u2019t even look at the underwear, i immediately threw it out. but it had done its job, and will be immortalized as a martyr through the sharing of this tale (moment of silence). my pants were mostly clean except for a bit of wetness right in the seam where there was pressure from the points of contact of my butt on the seat. there was also another small ring of wetness on the beltline. my dress shirt was mostly clean as well, with only a few small wet rings near the bottom where it must have been dragging. i sprayed them thoroughly with stain remover and put them through two wash cycles \u2013 i wasn\u2019t about to throw out a nice dress shirt and pair of dress pants just because i pooped on them a little. the car seat was completely clean except for one dime sized stain right in the center (i assume it leaked through my pants) which came right out with some cleaning solution. \n\nas this happened a few weeks ago, i have since made a new and improved poop-on-the-go kit: three 13 gallon garbage bags with drawstrings \u2013 one black and two clear \u2013 for pooping in and covering the seat, two pairs of rubber gloves, paper towels, baby wipes, a pair of dark colored underwear, and athletic shorts, all in a duffel bag. i will be looking into getting a bedpan or some sort of plastic container that i can poop in.\n\nwith all that said\u2026 the brisket was delicious.", "output": "TIFU by getting the brisket and trying to drive home", "category": "Title Generation 1137.json"}, {"instruction": "In

(oh the k-holes we fall into.) \n\nonce word broke out that steam powered giraffe was playing a show at a nearby radisson, we all knew serendipitously that this would be our glorious \u201choorah\u201d to sophomore year. we invited two mutual friends from out of town, shane and robbie, to join us in the festivities. they were also quite familiar with the band, and completely unfamiliar with the culture. \n\nso...the first pitfall we fell into was not understanding what the \u201csteam\u201d in \u201csteam powered giraffe\u201d implied. the second was ever trusting a radisson hotel. but giving credit to where it\u2019s due: the radisson delivered.  \n\non the day of the performance, shane and robbie arrived, and all of us gathered in the living room to smoke a bowl and buy tickets. and upon further internet research about this concert at the radisson, we learned we were about to enter a world we were not accustomed to, for this was not just a concert, but an entire festival. \n\nso what a perfect time to mention that mike had been saving five tablets of lsd for five adventurous boys! he\u2019d been waiting to try lsd ever since he woke up from a two-week long coma, no lie. so after the tickets were ordered, the acid was dropped. \n\na few hours pass, and somewhere, in the midst of five giggling dipshits, was an idea. an idea that would change the course of the entire experience. i forgot who, but either mike, dick, or myself, proposed that we would cosplay for the festival.\n\ni assumed the role of \u201creginald steamclaw,\u201d a smooth-talking inventor who sported a victorian aesthetic, complete with an eye-patch and a prop \u201cfreddy krueger\u201d glove. mike wore a vest, hardly looking the part, but we were on acid so it just seemed like everything was on point. shane and robbie decided to go as themselves, respectively. and then there\u2019s the aptly-named, dick.\n\nmike, shane, robbie, and i impatiently waited in a cab outside. dick was still \u201cgetting ready.\u201d finally, after a few uncomfortable minutes, the car door opened, and i swear, i never felt more claustrophobic in my life. it was like every bad memory i ever had manifested into a pointing finger, shaming me for all the poor decisions i\u2019ve made. dick assumed the role of \u201camerican man,\u201d the ultimate threat to the steampunk culture, sporting business-casual attire, a fourth-of-july party hat, and an american flag as a cape. my acid-fueled brain was trying to justify dick\u2019s act. was this genius or flat out wrong? this kid was pre-med after all. the cab driver was not having any of it, and even suspected \"american man\" of having a weapon on him. \n\nthe moment the cab dropped us off outside the radisson parking lot (where a majority of the festival took place), the boys and i were almost immediately the enemy. a cast of eccentric characters wandered the parking lot, and the many we encountered, glared at us for mocking their way of life. one individual, in particular, stared us down while cracking a whip. it only took a couple of vicious stares for dick to remove his \u201camerican man\u201d costume, in fear that someone would bludgeon him with a pair of brass goggles. \n\nat this point, i\u2019m not sure if we lost each other, or decided to split up, but either way, all of us ended up separated, with only two working phones. alone and slightly terrified, the effect of the acid only grew more intense, further testing the bounds of reality. \n\ni stumbled upon a ballroom where a formal victorian dance party was indeed occurring. the best way i can describe this room is \u201ceyes wide shut\u201d.  so i began interacting with the guests, and an eerie woman with lavish wings approached me, appearing oddly sensual. i said to her in a pseudo-british voice, \u201ci like your wings.\u201d she responded, seductively, \u201ci like your claws...but they\u2019re plastic.\u201d suddenly, as if a disc scratched, the ball came to an abrupt halt. i\u2019m not even kidding. all eyes seemed to be on me, and with the power of improvisation, i responded, morosely,  \u201cas is my heart.\u201d close one. the ball continued, and at this point, i was fully immersed into this character out of fear of being sought out as an outsider.\n\ni stood on the sidelines of the dancefloor, trying to collect myself. my heart was racing, my skin was sweating, my throat was dry, and just before i thought it couldn\u2019t possibly get any more real, i saw a monkey. it was one of the most creative cosplays i\u2019ve ever seen. this mysterious man was in heavy \u201cplanet of the apes\u201d-esque makeup, sporting a comically oversized top-hat. he was walking flamboyantly across the dancefloor, stealing drinks off trays, and stealing people\u2019s dates with such irresistible charm. i was convinced it was johnny depp. made perfect sense to me that he\u2019d want to cosplay under-the-radar at a steampunk festival in new jersey. \n\ni took a deep breath, and before i knew it, the monkey was beside me. \u201cthere you are, reginald!\u201d \n\ni stuttered, \u201cugh, yes, there you are, i\u2018ve been...waiting for you?\u201d\n\nan improvised relationship began to formulate between our characters. he then introduced me to his silent human-slave, jonathan, who, no bullshit, was dressed as an astronaut, and was subordinately chained to the bar. (\"jonathan\" may or may not have been his real name...). i told the monkey that i had been looking for my friends. i began explaining what they looked like, and what they were wearing. all of a sudden, a vendor, adjacent to the bar, claimed he saw one of my friends. \u201cyes, i remember your patriotic companion, he was at the game room.\u201d he then gave me a map of the radisson, and told me to \u201cmeander\u201d down a path a little outside of the festival. \u201coh, perfect, an adventure,\u201d the monkey proclaimed.\n\nthe monkey, his human slave, and i traveled to this strange location on the map. we were lucky to run into my friend mike, whom we then rescued from two plague doctors on stilts who were surrounding him like vultures circling their prey. mike looked terrified, and his confusion was only heightened by the introduction of the monkey and jonathan, who was being dragged around with a chain leash. poor guy just woke up from a fucking coma. and at some point, robbie appeared. he had been smoking jays in the parking lot to calm his anxiety. \n\nthe walk towards the game room, with every step, became increasingly chilling, as everyone fell silent. jonathan was already a mute, apparently, but clearly something wasn\u2019t right. we reached the game room, which was a large, ominous tent. i even broke character, and asked the monkey what was up with the game room. he responded with more \u201csteampunk\u201d jargon that i was obviously not aware of. mike, robbie and i approached the entrance to the tent. i noticed that the monkey and jonathan suspiciously stayed behind. the monkey then shouted, \u201creginald, wait, it\u2019s a trap. the vendor was a trickster!\u201d \n\nbefore i could even rationally respond, mike and robbie were already in the tent. i walked inside; it was a dark hallway leading to a red door. like a kubrickian nightmare, these suggestive, synchronized cyborgs danced along the sides of the hall, emitting erotic moans, pointing towards the red door. i saw mike in front of me. but to the left of me, i noticed robbie peering into an entrance to another room. in that room, i swear on my life, was a large man in a green wig, wearing a diaper, grinning at us in the most unnerving way. the what-the-fuck-o-meter was off the charts.\n\nmike was nervously waiting for me at the red door. i immediately grabbed him by the shoulder, and we left the tent. we never found out what existed beyond that door, but i imagine it was some horrific, robot orgy. wasn\u2019t having any of it.\n\neventually, we were able to regroup with the rest of the bunch. shane apparently spent the majority of his trip at a pottery tent making a gift for his significant other. the monkey and jonathan were nowhere to be seen. so without almost any verbal communication, we all collectively came to the agreement to get the fuck out of there. i didn't even get to see steam powered giraffe perform.\n\ntowards the end of the night, we gathered in mike\u2019s room, and passed around four maybe five blunts...to no avail. no amount of weed in the world could make sense of what we all experienced. and by no means were we the heroes of this tale. we mocked a culture, and they fired back on all cylinders. but if i gained anything from this journey, it was that i never wanted to act and perform more in my life up until that point. i suppose that\u2019s the beautiful takeaway. dick is almost done with medical school; helping people. \n\nthe worst part is that we don\u2019t even know if any of this actually happened. it wasn\u2019t until maybe a few months later that the boys and i learned that our acid tablets had been laced with pcp\u2026\n\nand, these days, i often wonder what the monkey is up to. was he real or a figment of my imagination? and then i\u2019ll see a trailer for some shitty johnny depp movie coming out, and my mind is at ease.\n\n \n\nedit: thank you for reading! i addressed my friends and added/corrected some details for authenticity. \n\nedit: spelling", "output": "TIFU by dropping acid at a Steampunk Festival (without knowing what Steampunk was)", "category": "Title Generation 1137.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text.

(monday is a holiday for us)\n\nso here i am, knowing i've screwed up.  feeling like an piece of crap.  i'm worried i will lose my job, and feeling it would be justified.  this company doesn't take lies well, even small ones.  i have all weekend to worry about it.  i'm already torn between figuring out how to regain his trust and respect, and starting the search for a new job.", "output": "TIFU by lying to the head of my department", "category": "Title Generation 1137.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text.

young decently physically attractive man, i've been around the block a few times with men (both topping and bottoming) without any trouble. i even have a goal in life: to have sex with every major race on the planet. so far, i've knocked off white, black, latino, and arab. all i was missing in my mind (although i know there are more) were indian, native american, and asian.\n \nso it's been about 6 months since i've had sex, and i was getting a little desperate. and where do desperate people go to have sex? craigslist. a week ago, i thought: \"fuck it. why not post and see what happens?\" i fill out everything and get a few good pics of myself. i put that i prefer safe sex and i\u2019m verse, rather muscular, mobile, ddf, open to all races, etc. and i post.\n \ni get responses, but half of them are overweight 50 year-old men looking to be my \"daddy\", and i'd rather throw up than have sex with them. the other half just don't really suit me. so after a day, i give up and head to the beach in florida for a relaxing vacation with some family members with my ad still up in craigslist.\n \nin florida, i go off of my healthy eating lifestyle and eat til my heart's content. fried shrimp, tuna, fried calamari, burgers, and more all down my gut. there wasn't much to do in where i was in florida, but the food was great. although two days ago, as i'm laying in bed, i see that i had a few more responses trickle in from my post a while back. most were of the same shit from before until i saw one: \"curious asian looking\" so i open the response.\n \ni was expecting someone just like the rest, but from the pictures he sent, he was in great shape, wanted to host, and wanted safe sex, all checks in my book, so i respond. after chatting a while, he tells me that he\u2019s had sex with women, but he wasn\u2019t sure that he was straight and wanted to try it with a guy to make sure. i told him that i have no problem with his curiosity and that it'd be best for him to top because prepping to be a bottom is a pain in the ass (literally). i tell him that i'm out of town, but i'll be back in a couple of days so we can hook up then. he seems pretty nervous about it all and very cautious, but we plan for the night on the day i get back from florida.\n \nfor all of you straight people out there, prepping to bottom is annoying and time consuming. you can't eat 24 hours before you have sex and/or you have to clean out your system with an enema right beforehand. if you don\u2019t, shit hits the fan (or the dick should i say). the problem was that the seafood was just too damn good, and i wasn\u2019t going to turn down an opportunity for the older family members to pay for dinner. i decide i\u2019ll bank on the enema.\n \ncoming back from florida, i\u2019m really excited. i get to have sex for the first time in a while and get one step closer to my \u201cmr. worldwide\u201d goal. i even stop eating just in case, solely drinking water. i do all of the enema stuff (all coming out clear so i know my system is clean). my ass is a bit wet still but i had to hurry up to david (not his name, but i\u2019ll just call him that) because i got back from florida later than expected. i rush over to his place.\n \npulling up to his place. it was in a sketchy location, but the building was really nice. david owns a small computer company so i have a good feeling about his apartment. i rush up to his apartment building, look up his name, and david buzzes me in. i go to his room and david opens the door.\n \nlooking at david, he didn't really look like the photos he sent me. he was a kinda lanky and not as hot as he led me to think, but at this point, it\u2019s not like i\u2019m in the mood to turn around. david introduces me to his cat and tries to make small talk because he\u2019s nervous, but we both know we\u2019re not here for small talk. looking around his apartment, it\u2019s minimal, but nice: granite countertops, a huge tv, new washer and dryer, and, mentioning in his small talk, a brand new bed in his bedroom with white covers. he asks if i need to use his living room bathroom sink or even his bedroom shower, but i tell him that i\u2019m all good so we head to his bedroom.\n \nin david's bedroom, we start making out, and boy is he a great kisser. a real pro. tonight\u2019s going to be a good night. \n \nhere\u2019s where it gets really nsfw. i\u2019m so fucking ashamed of this. if you decided to skim my story, this is where my tifu starts.\n \ndavid starts to strip my clothes off. i\u2019ve never had anyone take off my clothes with such ease and it\u2019s really fucking sexy. we lay on his new white bed naked and he starts rimming my ass. i then suck his dick, and he flips me so my stomach is on the bed with my ass facing toward him. he then lays on top of me and goes straight for my ear, licking and slurping my ear. a bit odd but who am i to judge. david puts on a condom, lubes it, shoves it in my ass, and lays on top of me.\n \nin movies, sex sounds like a really wet clopping noise like that klonking sound you can make with your tongue. it sounded like that. klonk klonk klonk repeated over and over. it sounded really weird to me because i can feel that my ass is wet. in my mind, i just thought it was because my ass was still a little wet from the enema, so i didn't say anything. after a minute, he stops with his dick still inside my ass.\n \n\u201coh shit.\u201d says david.\n \n\u201cwhat?\u201d\n \n\u201cshit!\u201d\n \nmy shit is on his dick. fuck. i didn't clean out enough. he starts freaking out. some of my wet shit ended up on his bed.\n \nas he starts pulling his dick out of my ass, my stomach grumbles and i felt a feeling i\u2019ve never felt before. it was a mixture of fear, the feeling when you start falling from a roller coaster, and the feeling when you're about to shit your pants.\n \ndavid pulls it out all of the way and my asshole turns into the fucking niagara falls. wet shit starts flying everywhere. all over him, my legs, his new bed, the floor, and probably his fucking cat. everywhere. and god does it smell. all of that fried seafood i ate in florida hid in my colon and was making a break for it. i\u2019ve never smelt something so putrid come out of my body in my life. i\u2019m about to puke.\n \ni look back and david is covered in my wet, rotten seafood shit. david is dry heaving, sprinting to his bathroom, but doesn't make it; he pukes on his living room floor. \n \ni have no idea what to do. i need to get the shit off of my legs, but at this point, i need to get the hell out of there. i\u2019m frozen.\n \nafter throwing up, david runs into the bathroom, almost slipping on the mixture of his vomit and my shit on the way. he closes the door and turns the shower on, mumbling \u201cshit\u201d under his breath. then, i jog to his living room bathroom, use sink water and all of his toilet paper to wipe the shit off of me, and put my clothes on.\n \ni walk over to david\u2019s bedroom bathroom and the door is locked. i knock and ask him if he\u2019s ok and if i need to get him anything. he coughs out a yes and that i just need to get the hell out and that he\u2019s never going to have sex with a guy ever again. with the stench of rotten seafood still in the air, vomit on the floor, and shit stains on his new bed, i slap all of the money in my wallet ($70) on his living room coffee table and leave.\n \nso here i am, beginning to write this to you all after showering the rest of the shit off of me. i fucked up. i really did. i tried to text him, but he, understandably, has not responded. i might even have an ear infection. tifu.\n \n \n\nedit: i posted this yesterday, but it got deleted because it wasn't the

awesome, shall we begin?\n\ni'll start off by explaining i work in a museum as part of the education team which means i teach school groups most days. yesterday we had a school we weren't expecting show up (which doesn't happen often but still happens) but it was only one class so while another member of our team lead the group i spent most of the day getting on with preparing a presentation i have to give in a few weeks.\n\nnow we're a fairly laid back office on days like this & recently when i'm busy at home i generally have something playing on netflix in the background, so much so that i'm used to have background noise while i'm working on anything for a long period of time, so i spent most of yesterday working on my presentation with 'scrubs' on in the background. \n\nmost days i work from 9-4 but on tuesdays i finish at 3 because i have to get from work to a brownie unit i've been helping with but that's currently on hold however i still planned to leave early as i had two flat viewings that evening with bob (the fiance mentioned in previous posts), one at 4:30 & one at 5. now at lunch time bob rang me to say he wasn't well & wouldn't be able to make the viewings, so i rang & cancelled the 4:30 one as it was a secondary viewing booked because he got held up at work last week & couldn't make it there last week & it seemed pointless viewing it alone again but we decided i should go to the other one & report back if it was any good. i told him to go to bed & get some rest then had some lunch before getting back to work.\ni keep working on my presentation, 'scrubs' happily playing on in the background & before i know it, it's 3 o'clock. now usually i'd be out like a shot (not that i don't love my job but that office gets really hot & stuffy) but i'm doing well with my work & it won't take me two hours to get to this flat so i decide to get a drink then stick around till half past instead, not so long that i'd be late but long enough to get a bit more work done & one more episode of 'scrubs' to play, seems like a good plan, don't you think?\n\nso i keep going till half past, i save, shut down, sign out & head for the bus stop. the bus is late of course, as usual but it eventually turns up & i get on & start my way to this flat. i get into town at about quarter to & worry i might be a tad late so i ring the estate agent to let them know just in case then head off to get the bus that will take me closer to where i need to be. this bus is also late but i get on & at 4:59 i am sitting in my seat on the top deck, waiting for us to move when suddenly another bus comes up to pull in at the stop just in front of the one my bus is at. \n\nnow this particular street is part of a busy bus station that also allows general traffic, so at times this street can be packed with vehicles & clearly this particular bus driver doesn't have the patience to wait for anyone else to move so he can pull in & he obviously thinks that there's enough space for him to get past...he's almost right, almost. \n\nfor a moment he glides past with ease then suddenly there's a horribly loud, wrenching, unfamiliar noise that sounds a lot like something breaking & quite a few people seem more than a bit concerned with the events unfolding outside of our bus. after about a minute or so we hear the inevitable sentence \"you'll have to get off & wait for the next one\"...shit. we all pile off & only then to we see what's really happened, the moving bus has almost made it but for that darn protrusion at the front of our bus known as the wing mirror...which is now in two parts, the arm lying on the ground, abandoned by the actual mirror which is now residing on the dashboard inside the bus, a hitherto unexplored area now accessed due to the window now broken & spread across the road. the bus that was moving also has a broken window at the back (really hope no one was sat there at the time, there didn't seem to be anyone hurt thankfully). i look at this scene as anger flashes briefly through me, soon replaced by acceptance at my shitty luck, why am i surprised? i take out my phone to call the estate agent \n\n\"sorry, i'm going to be later than expected, my bus was just hit by another bus\" \n\n\"oh, wow, well we can wait around for you but we have to have the keys back at the office by half past so if you make it by twenty past you'll only have a few minutes to look around, you'll have to hurry, see you soon\"\n\n...shit. the time is now 5:18 & i'm trapped in the back corner of a completely packed single decker trying to hold everyone who just got off the double decker, panicking that when i get there a, i won't be able to get off because of all the people & b, the estate agent will have gone already.\n\nat 5:25 i squeeze my way off the bus, apologizing to everyone i have to push past on my way, & run from the stop round the corner, following the dot on my phone & praying she's still there...she is, thank god! & after all that effort?

feel free to delete it mods if it isn't tifu worthy.\n\nsome backstory about myself,  i grew up with a really dark childhood, i'm not gonna go into detail but let's say after everything i've seen throughout my life i've grown up to have little to no sympathy with anyone. i was pretty much depressed for most of my high school life and  extremely anti-social. i can barely hold a conversation with someone for more than 5 minutes because i eventually get bored of what they have to say. i hate people and am scared of them at the same time, at one point in time i even skipped a semester of college because i was too scared of getting rejected by my blockmates, literally on the first day of school i could already see my soon to be classmates and compared to them i look like a nobody so i backed off, went back home, told my mom i couldn't do it because i was too scared. she understood and said to take all the time i need.\n\nso during this time i didn't go out of my house at all, gained a lot of weight, had poor hygiene and spent most my day infront of the computer. my mom told me my high school classmates were looking for me, but i told her to tell them that i moved outside the country to avoid them. \n\neventually after a couple of months spending all day on the computer i've become really good at this online game called league of legends and started to get really popular, but nobody i was friends with online knew my real name or anything personal about me and i kept it that way for a long time until i joined a team which required me to give off my personal info, so for the first time in a long time i've actually decided to make myself known to a few people (teammates). i eventually became friends with the rest of my teammates' friends but they still knew nothing about me since i told them to not give off any personal details about me. after playing a couple of pub games i played with this girl, i treated her like i treated everyone with my old anti-social self, few words stuff like that. she wouldn't stop talking to me and i eventually found her annoying so i asked her why she wanted to know more about me. she told me she said i seemed troubled and wanted to help me. i asked her why she wanted to help me and she said that its just the way she is.  so i told her a bit about myself and why i'm like this but not everything of course, til this day i still don't know why i did that. we started to play more  and became really close friends, keep in mind she still has no idea what my name is or anything, just a story about my past. \n\none day she invited me to join a chat room with her friends and i was like yeah sure why not, when i got in everybody greeted me and they were all really friendly, they asked me if i had a mic and i said no, nobody has ever  heard my voice before and i didn't want to talk to them anyway because i was still scared of being rejected or being teased about my voice and whatnot. eventually they all left and it was just me and that girl left in the room, she asked me to get a mic and i told her i didn't want to but she was insistent she said she really wanted to hear me speak and for another unknown reason i did it, i went to a store and bought a cheap mic so i could talk to her. i told her about it and she was really happy and asked if we could start chatting and i was still quite hesitant, i had my mic but i was still petrified of the fact that i'm about to talk to a complete stranger online. i just said hi, and that was literally the only thing i said vocally, everything else i typed out instead cuz i was still pretty scared. she was ok with it and teased me saying that i have a cute voice and told me that i should talk to her more often to get used to being social. eventually i did about a couple of months after i started talking to people and i finally gave out my name and that's when i started to get really popular, i didn't like being popular because i still hated being social and interacting with people i dont know. throughout this i've been talking to her pretty much everyday she came back from school or when she goes online and i started to like her a lot. i could tell she liked me too and she asked if we could meet but unfortunately her place was a 2 hr flight from my place, and her semester doesnt end in 3 months, so she said we should meet during summer and i told her i'd try. so during that time before summer i started to work out again, make myself look presentable, cut my hair cuz i really liked her and wanted to make the best impression towards her. \n\nsummer came and i asked my really close friend if i could stay at his place for a while and he was cool with it, although i could only stay for 2 weeks and that was more than enough. so i flew over to his place and right after i got on his computer i told her that i was here and she was ecstatic, she told me she couldn't wait to see me and she'd come over here tomorrow. i started to get really nervous cuz this was the first time i'd be talking to a girl irl that i really liked and i was scared she wouldn't like me. so the next morning while i was playing some games with my friend, his parents told us that there was a girl at the door and i was like \"holy shit this is it\" i was literally trembling. she came in and instantly recognized me and gave me a hug. my friend then said that we should watch a movie together and so we did, after the movie we went back to his place and i immediately crashed into his bed cause i was dead tired, she hopped into bed with me for whatever reason and my friend just went back on his pc right behind us. i didn't know what to do, so i just laid there quiet and she knew that was pretty nervous so she decided to break the ice and started a conversation with me, we talked and played in bed a bit like she started hitting me and playfully biting me. so after 5 minutes of that i decided to tell her that i really liked her she said she liked me too and yeah that was the start of our relationship, i eventually had to go back to my place since my friend only let me stay for 2 weeks. she was pretty sad, i was sad too but i told her that i was gonna move here for college so i could be close to her and a month later i eventually did, i'm staying in a condominium right now and we did see each other more often and we were a relatively happy couple for 6 months. eventually she started getting busy with school and she was pretty sad from what i could tell but she never told me why.\ni talked to her asking her what was  wrong and she said she was scared i wouldn't care if she told me because of my non sympathetic personality. she told me that i was never there to comfort her because i didn't know how and she had to talk to other people instead about it cuz she knew i wouldn't react that much.\n \n    i felt like shit but she was right, even after 6 months i still had the same personality, anti-social, non sympathetic, low self esteem, no self confidence or anything. i didn't know what to say, i apologized and i told her that i do care about her and i wish i could help and i'd try to be more interactive with her since i still have some trouble holding a conversation with her too. so a week after we were relatively ok and i asked her to go on a date with me. it's been so long since i've gone on a date with her since she's been busy the entire month with school and her parents are really strict, it got postponed a few times but we eventually did go out yesterday. \n\ni was really excited that i'd get to see her again. i slept early, got dressed and left. i texted her that i was already at the mall and she told me she wouldn't be able to go out of her house til noon so i sat infront of the arcade for 3 hrs waiting for her to arrive, eventually she did. i gave her a kiss and a long warm hug and told her how much i missed her. we then bought tickets to watch penguins of madagascar  which aired in about an our and a half so she told me that we should sit outside by the garden while waiting. so there we were and i was pretty happy i was finally with her again, she then gave me this sad face and told me we had to talk, i asked her what about and she said about us. she told me that her friends and mom told her that we weren't fit to be in a relationship together since i don't seem to be ready with all the personal issues i have and my personality, i had to let that sink in for a minute and i felt my heart get torn in half and i asked her what does that mean for us then. she told me she was breaking up with me. she started crying and she said she still wanted to be with me, but i had to fix myself first with all my issues but until then we wouldn't be able to be together, we could still hang out but just as friends. i didn't know what to say, i felt so terrible i just sat there speechless and she told me she was willing to wait for me if i would change, but she didn't know how long she'd wait because she said she might fall for somebody new. i started tearing up, i didn't want to see her with another man, i invested so much into being with her and now she's breaking up with me and probably going to find another man. \n\nshe asked me if i still wanted to talk to her cause she said it would be fine if i didn't, she'd understand. i told her i'd still want to be with her and that i really did love her and she gave me a hug. i wiped my face and we just sat there quiet, i didn't want to leave i still wanted to spend the rest of our last day together so i asked her if we could at least watch the movie together before she leaves, she said ok, but i was too busy crying in the cinema to even pay attention to it. after the movie she said her driver was gonna pick her up and i said i'd wait outside with her before she left, we waited outside for 30 minutes before her driver picked her up, she gave me one last kiss and one warm hug before she left, i went home afterwards, cried myself to sleep and here i am now brokenhearted, dead inside and hating myself for being such a terrible fucking person to not be able to change for anybody. \n\ni don't know what to do anymore, i just feel lost, the only person who made me think i was worth something left and i just feel empty like there's gonna be that permanent hole in my heart that'll never be sealed. so yeah i fucked up, i'm stupid, i'm worthless. i fucked up. i'm gonna spend the rest of my day crying myself to sleep again.", "output": "TIFU by being myself", "category": "Title

'at least you can get back in now' is agreed by all. they sweep up the broken glass outside and leave the rest in my truck. so on top of being on the clock for 2 extra hours because i fucked up, the company will also pay two dudes to break my window which also will need to be replaced. i drive back to the station pretending the wind in my hair isn't a swirling maelstrom of glass shards and immense guilt. \n\nback at the station, there are no real bosses around but i am assured i'll hear about it monday. probably in real trouble this time. i leave work and feel like crying but it's hot outside and my whole body is crying so i decide against it.", "output": "TIFU by locking myself out of my work truck", "category": "Title Generation 1137.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text.

do you even want to get better or do you just want to end it?\" she tells me she does love me but she doesn't want to anymore. this for whatever reason sets me off to a blackout point. i start talking mad shit and threatening suicide, but i really fucked up when i made a move for an actual firearm. she jumps up to stop me and we get into a physical altercation, and then she calls her cousins to come forcibly remove me from a house we lived in together, granted it's her house but i will always consider that place a true \"home\". so i say fine let them come. and we still argue and she gets mad when i won't leave and decides to pepper spray me, needless to say i didn't let that go lightly and we get into an all out brawl. my skin is still burning as i type this. but my heart hurts so much more, because we are finished from these juvenile actions on my part. and i hate myself for everything i've done and become. words of advice: if you love someone, don't fucking lie to them. not even once.\n\n<b>", "output": "TIFU by letting my emotions ruin my already in shambles relationship", "category": "Title Generation 1137.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text.

(btw, in my 27 levels of legit gameplay, it took one quick spoof to catch my *second* charmander in my entire life. the first charmander was the free one they give you when you start the game.)\n\ninstantly i was hooked to spoofing. i didn't use it to conquer gyms or catch op strong pokemon; in fact, i still only have 3 strong pokemon, and they're currently occupying random gyms in idk-where asia and they've been there for months (rip no more vaporeons). i used it to travel the world tbh, visiting places around the world (me: \"let's go to the eiffel tower, or the berlin wall, or the great wall of china, hell let's go to australia!\") eventually, i spoofed myself to boredom and quit the game. (once you spoof, you'll never play aloof.) it just defeats all the purpose of the game, and it's no longer interesting to me anymore.\n\non the last day of college, when my dad came to help me pack up and leave, he started up the pokemon go app again. he said, \"bet you're gonna miss these pokestops, huh?\" and i casually replied, \"nah, nobody plays anymore. everybody just hacks nowadays, the game is dead.\" he responded, \"oh...\" and that was that.\n\ni'll never forget that look on his face. he looked sad, kinda like a defeated sad. as if this was his favorite game, and i just told him it sucks. woops. i'm fucking crying right now while typing this. it feels like the last thing that kept us together was gone. and i feel like such a shitty son for what i did. i didn't even know how important this was to him until i just dropped the bomb like that. i killed the game for myself, and i kinda just killed the game for my dad too. it's so obvious he was only playing to keep in touch with his kids. this was the first effort he made to actually connect with us again in a long time, since we're all adults now. and i fucking slaughtered it. i'm such a shitty son. even at graduation, which happened like a few days ago, *i still yelled at my parents.* i can't help it and i don't know how to fix it. i wish it was easier, but holy shit is this hard.", "output": "TIFU by spoofing Pokemon Go", "category": "Title Generation 1137.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text.

only fair.\n\nso, for a couple of minutes we're trying to see who can roast his marshmallow perfectly. to do that, you require your own little area of the fire, and tending to that required a perfect mix of newspaper, matches and blowing on it. \n\nto be honest, i don't know who threw the last matchstick, because the first few seconds are a blur except \"tink\" and a strange sensation on my foot. really, had no idea what happened and when i did figure it out there was fire on my sock. \n\nit was only a couple of second later that i realized that the ashtray had exploded and that there was fucking magma and burning matches and burning newspaper all over the carpet, some on the couch, some on the vcr, everywhere. \n\nas calmly as possible for a person of my demeanor, i said \"holy shit\" and started swatting at my sock. jay, meanwhile, had risen and stepped back, was staring at the scene completely confused. like \"holy shit mastrorvm's sock is on fire, but holy shit wtf just happened in other areas too.\" \n\nshortly after i got my sock off, we sprang into action, each taking different routes to water sources. i ran to the bathroom and grabbed the cup that they kept their toothbrushes in, jay to the kitchen and filled a pot. i should say that my route was obstructed by burning stuff, so i went the only sensible route that i could choose, and jay had the edge on getting towards the kitchen. all the time we're yelling to each other \"holy fuck, what happened.\"\n\nwe eventually extinguish all the fires. the damage is done, though. the ashtray is completely destroyed, has exploded. it formerly resided on jay's parent's coffee table, so we're going to have to figure out how to explain that. eventually, we couldn't come up with an explanation (were probably too exhausted) and just pretended that didn't happen.\n\nnext, the burnt carpet. actually, and surprisingly, the area under the ashtray was not burnt so bad. the area just around it was like a bomb had gone off, albeit a small bomb. and everywhere that the bomb sent shrapnel was now doused in water. the vcr we just had to beat out, because we didn't want to do any damage to it. sensitive electronic equipment and water don't mix, yo?\n\nby now it's 2am, jay's mom gets off work at 4 and will be home by 4:30.\n\nour course of action was clear, after much discussion: vacuum up the water in a shop vac, and then shave off the burnt fibers of the carpet. \n\nwe set about scratching off, in the finest way possible at first but eventually just dragging the knives across, the burnt bits of carpet. there were probably 30 areas that had been on fire, and there was a significant circle of carpet in the middle of the explosion that was obvious. not too obvious, but obvious. \n\njust a few feet from the fireplace, mind you. \n\nwe actually went and got the dog's brush and distributed hair around the epicenter to disguise it to look like dust bunnies.  \n\nwe were still working on this stuff when she pulled up. we'd made some precautions, like putting away the shop vac, and ran to bed. she came in and put away her stuff (we were upstairs but could hear her) and complained that she knew that we'd made a fire (this is freaking june and it was warm outside, can't blame her). \n\nwe'd left a couple of the charred forks somewhere in the kitchen. the next morning she confronted us. we didn't give her the whole story, about the stupidity of building a fire in an ashtray or even acknowledge the destruction of the ashtray, but i did cop to smoking cigarettes in the house. at this point, she didn't know that jay was a smoker at all, so she said i couldn't come over the rest of the summer, and jay couldn't come over to mine. which really blew in those days. \n\nshe never punished jay, either, so at least he didn't get found out. we did a good job cleaning that shit up. she was a single mom at that time, living in a really too-big house, with a lot on her plate. she must have figured something out, though.\n\nall through high school, jay and i would hang out in public but when i went over to their house i was pariah #1. she remarried a complete dick that would fuck with me constantly, fuck with my friends, too. she sold that house and moved elsewhere, the same stuff continued. that burnt marshmallow fork. \n\n\n**tl:dr** roast marshmallows in an ashtray, nearly cause a house fire, friend's mom is on to me", "output": "TIFU by roasting marshmallows in an ashtray", "category": "Title Generation 1137.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text.

(what can i say? i never hid a guy in my closet before and i'm a bad liar).\n\nwe somehow think he knew my bf was hiding in the closet, but it was a good thing he didn't open it. if he did, he might have never talked to me again or beaten up my bf.", "output": "TIFU by wanting sexy time with my boyfriend on a school day", "category": "Title Generation 1137.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text.

(meaning the brakes weren't in park) so there i am trying to hold a 27,000 lb truck from rolling any farther. i am a large guy but there is no stopping a huge truck from rolling. during all this, all the alignment sensors and sensor holders are smashing and busting into hundreds of peices. i have everyone in the shop running over yelling at me to get out of the way and to let it roll. my boss had managed to run over and jump in the truck and set the brakes real quick before it crashed through the door. \nall in all, i broke all the sensors to the only alignment equipment we have and we use it every day. we have over 5,000 trucks in the fleet. the sensors and the holding racks cost nearly $10,000. that's not including the program to be updated when we get the new alignment equipment. may or may not lose my job tomorrow. i'm really hoping for the best... \n\n \n\nupdate: heading into work now, will let everyone know how it goes. either on my first break, lunch or if they tell me to leave. lol thanks to everyone for the encouragement and kind words. i hope it all goes well. can't be getting fired before the holidays lol \n\nupdate 2: came into work and everything was normal. kinda... everyone kept asking what happened last night and everyone kept looking at me weird but also thanking me because we get a new machine. so word was spread pretty quick to first shift. but that being said... i still have my job. machine is covered by insurance and will be getting new and much updated machine next week. we had a safety meeting on what we need to do from now on and we have changed how we are setting up the alignment process. so all in all, everything is all well. didn't get a slap on the wrist either just was told to get out of the way instead of jumping in front of a large semi to stop it. i guess i'm no superman after all. thank you all for the encouragement and helpful tips. ps. i know now it's chock not chalk. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a", "output": "TIFU by breaking a $10,000 machine at work", "category": "Title Generation 1137.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text.

(fucking up already)\n\ni begin to really trust him\u2026the surprising part is that, i began to trust again. just a year ago my heart was pretty determined to trust no one ever again.\n\nfor the next three weeks, we are inseparable, we went one day without seeing each other until he left to bonnaroo with my og friend. it was harder for me to admit how i felt because it was all happening so fast and felt right and yet i had been led down that path before, where it all looked so clear, when only it turned into a trap. i had been hurt too much that the feeling of loving someone or someone loving me was not possible. love like i thought did not exist no matter how much i offered my heart out. it always seems that the one i feel is just right\u2026disappears. i had a little mushroom trip while he was gone and realized i was holding back on him and should tell him how i really feel...and i did. he did not believe me because what i feared would happen... is what happened two days later. \n\neven though he would ask or want to be in presence, his energy felt as if he did not even want to be there. \nhe did a complete 180. \nnearly everyone at work knew, we were becoming something, whatever it was, i was going with the flow and along with the ride because i trusted him to take control. \n\ni was wrong. i do not want to be, but i was. \n\nsince then, our encounters are awkward and i find myself fighting every urge inside of me to tell him how i really feel because i also believe he made himself clear when he said, \u201cyou are too much of a distraction for me right now.\u201d i should pass it by. water off my back right? the show must go on? \n\nthat was and is the hard part.\n\nhe will place himself right beside me, whisper his silly puns that literally never stopped to put a smile upon my face. whether they were corny and awful or clever as fuck, i enjoyed them all the same. he thought my laughs were fake. they were genuine and i guess that is where my friends are right about him being wrong for me. he didn\u2019t believe me. he didn\u2019t trust me\u2026as much as i did in him. \n\nkind of heartbreaking, to feel for someone that much and finally feel so close to having what you always thought was good enough, and still battle with how you deserve better than \u201cgood enough.\u201d\n\nyet, there is something about him. i am not sure why there is such a hold, when it is all false hope. his eyes don\u2019t tell me that, when i catch them, looking my direction, locking contact for a few seconds, only for one of us to distract ourselves. the way he looked and held himself when i showed up to a mutual friends\u2019 apartment from a straight up date just four nights ago. \n\njudge me all you want for trying to go on dates and meet other people. if he was over me, isn\u2019t that what i am supposed to do if i so please? because at this point i have come to terms with these strong feelings i have are pointless, useless, and what is done and in the past it is staying there. still, dreams of him come every night. *see you again* by tyler the creator are the words i would sing to him. hell a made an entire playlist and add to it when i hear a song that relates to the situation with him. \n\nto top off how i have fucked up any chance with him, i left what should be my final attempt with getting him back in his jacket that he is taking back. his last day at work is saturday and i thought about waiting until then but i couldn\u2019t. i wrote him a song. he has inspired a lot of lyrics of late for me and the one i left him\u2026the least i could ask is he keeps it and he knows someone loves him. best case scenario, i find him in my arms and i in his again. the worst, and most realistic, is he tells me to give it up and leave him alone, that i am wasting my time and my energy, and he throws the lyrics away, which in essence is my heart. \n\ni fucked up y\u2019all. i fell for someone after telling myself for a good year to avoid the feels, and avoid attachments for the exact outcomes that occurred. \n\ni probably fucked up this tifu too. \n\nthank you to anyone who read this shitty word vomit.\n\n \n\n\nedit: typos and words added\n\nedit: moved my tl;dr to the right spot.", "output": "TIFU by leaving my heART for a boy who will probably not care.", "category": "Title Generation 1137.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text.
