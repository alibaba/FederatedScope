The Bible itself is the arsenal whence each innovator has drawn his deceptive arguments.\" The Bible, like the Quran, is full of the relics of bad theology. God by definition cannot have a \"change of heart,\" but clearly over the span of time the Bible was written, less so for the Quran (which is puzzling, given its many conflicting commands toward peace and Jihad), the people's understanding of their God changed.

The American Catholic Church has always held to social justice for migrants, refugees, undocumented immigrants, poor people, workers, tackling climate change, tackling nuclear proliferation, questions of war and peace, etc. \n\nThese issues don't get as much attention because culture war issues are more important for liberals and conservatives in North American and Western culture. A Bishop criticizing abortion is much more likely to get attention than a bishop or priest showing solidarity with undocumented migrants at the U.S Mexico border. Not saying the former aren't important(because questions around human sexuality, Gender equality and reproductive issues are important) but we should recognize that when society says the Church is \"too obsessed\" with an issue.....it's more a reflection of what society feels is important rather than the Church itself.", "output": "Non-toxic", "category": "Toxic Language Detection 955.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms.

And everyone says that unfounded means they MUST be false allegations. That's too simplified for me, based on the amount of men and women that have been reported to be assaulted on college campuses alone in studies. Rape does happen and often victims do not get justice There is also an issue that training is not properly done in these settings. My friend in BC worked in corrections and there is not an emphasis on appropriate conduct. In fact she found the inmates to be a relief compared to the STAFF she had to work with. The point is is that there aren't ways for police to determine if rape cases are true or false often. There needs to be a better method than he said she said.
