Perhaps the cost of medical treatment is moot as both groups received that, but it\u2019s useful context for the reader. CABG is major surgery and consequently expensive. Some estimates of cost for uninsured patients range from $70,000 to $200,000. Even with medical insurance coverage, deductibles can be very large. It\u2019s also possible that the high cost of surgery could be offset by less need for downstream care among surgical patients who appeared to fare better in the study \u2014 e.g. less need for hospitalizations and other costly care. Discussion of any or all of these points would have earned the release a Satisfactory rating. The benefits of this approach are discussed in the release and quantified. \u201cThe bypass surgery was associated with an overall 1.4-year increase in median survival time (7.7 vs. 6.3 years),\u201d according to the release. Overall, the release did a nice job of presenting absolute rates of death in each group of study participants, but there was no mention of statistical significance which would have been helpful to include for more savvy readers. The potential harms of a major surgery like CABG should have been mentioned as they must be considered and weighed against the benefits of 1.4 years of additional survival. The National Heart Lung and Blood Institute says the risks of CABG include \u201cwound infection and bleeding, reactions to anesthesia, fever, pain, stroke, heart attack, or even death.\u201d The release does a good job of characterizing the quality of the evidence, but we\u2019re always open to even more details, such as how the study was blinded to prevent bias. The researchers managed to track nearly all of the subjects in the initial study. It is unclear how they accounted for those patients who later received CABG, left ventricular assist devices or heart transplants, but the 10 follow-up data appear well done. There is no disease mongering here. Coronary artery disease is widespread among the older American population. The funding sources are clearly stated in the paper. As this is part of a clinical trial, there appears to be no conflict of interest. The study itself compared alternatives, with half the patients randomized for medical treatment only and the other half for medical treatment and CABG. No comparison was made to the alternatives of heart transplant or left ventricular assist devices, but these do seem to be unusual treatments in this population. The release doesn\u2019t talk about how often or widely CABG is used but it is well known that CABG is available and has been in use for many years. It would have been helpful to mention that CABG is performed\u00a0on sicker patients in some specialty hospitals. The release claims novelty through this statement by a lead investigator: \u201cThe current 10-year follow-up provides new important insights about patient subgroups that are more likely to benefit from CABG as compared to medical therapy alone.\u201d The procedure itself is not novel but this appears to be new information concerning patient outcomes in a specific subgroup.

Whether demand builds remains to be seen, but the oil\u2019s transition into the food supply signals gene editing\u2019s potential to alter foods without the controversy of conventional GMOs, or genetically modified organisms. Among the other gene-edited crops being explored: Mushrooms that don\u2019t brown, wheat with more fiber, better-producing tomatoes, herbicide-tolerant canola and rice that doesn\u2019t absorb soil pollution as it grows. Unlike conventional GMOs, which are made by injecting DNA from other organisms, gene editing lets scientists alter traits by snipping out or adding specific genes in a lab. Startups including Calyxt say their crops do not qualify as GMOs because what they\u2019re doing could theoretically be achieved with traditional crossbreeding. So far, U.S. regulators have agreed and said several gene-edited crops in development do not require special oversight. It\u2019s partly why companies see big potential for gene-edited crops. \u201cThey\u2019ve been spurred on by the regulatory decisions by this administration,\u201d said Greg Jaffe of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a health watchdog group. But given the many ways gene editing can be used, Jaydee Hanson of the Center for Food Safety said regulators should consider the potential implications of each new crop. He cited the example of produce gene-edited to not brown. \u201cYou\u2019ve designed it to sit around longer. Are there problems with that?\u201d he said. Already, most corn and soy grown in the U.S. are herbicide-tolerant GMOs. Just last week, regulators cleared a hurdle for salmon genetically modified to grow faster. The fish is the first genetically modified animal approved for human consumption in the U.S. Though regulators say GMOs are safe, health and environmental worries have persisted, and companies will soon have to disclose when products have \u201cbioengineered\u201d ingredients. Calyxt says its oil does not qualify as a GMO. The oil is made from soybeans with two inactivated genes to produce more heart-healthy fats and no trans fats. The company says the oil also has a longer shelf life, which could reduce costs for food makers or result in longer-lasting products. Soybean oils took a hit when regulators moved to ban oils with trans fats. Other trans fat-free soybean oils have become available in the years since, but the industry has found it difficult to win back food makers that already switched to different oils, said John Motter, former chair of the United Soybean Board. Calyxt said the first customer is a company in the Midwest with multiple restaurant and foodservice locations, such as building cafeterias. It said the customer is using it in dressings and sauces and for frying, but didn\u2019t specify if the oil\u2019s benefits are being communicated to diners. Calyxt is working on other gene-edited crops that it says are faster to develop than conventional GMOs, which require regulatory studies. But Tom Adams, CEO of biotech company Pairwise, said oversight of gene-edited foods could become stricter if public attitude changes. \u201cYou should never think of regulation as settled,\u201d Adams said. Pairwise is partnering with Monsanto-parent Bayer on developing gene-edited crops. Views on gene-editing vary too. The National Organic Standards Board said foods made with gene editing cannot qualify as organic . And last year, Europe\u2019s highest court said gene-edited foods should be subject to the same rules as conventional GMOs. ____ Follow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

It didn\u2019t start with Trump\u2019s bungled messaging downplaying the crisis even as it\u2019s worsened, nor with his mid-March insistence that social distancing measures could be lifted by Easter (he later backpedaled). It began in April 2018 \u2014 more than a year and a half before the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the disease it causes, Covid-19, sickened enough people in China that authorities realized they were dealing with a new disease. The Trump administration, with John Bolton newly at the helm of the White House National Security Council, began dismantling the team in charge of pandemic response, firing its leadership and disbanding the team in spring 2018. The cuts, coupled with the administration\u2019s repeated calls to cut the budget for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other public health agencies, made it clear that the Trump administration wasn\u2019t prioritizing the federal government\u2019s ability to respond to disease outbreaks. That lack of attention to preparedness, experts say, helps explain why the Trump administration has consistently botched its response to the coronavirus pandemic. In response to such criticisms, U.S. President Donald Trump sought to affix blame on other people and entities, including his predecessor in the White House, Barack Obama: For decades the @CDCgov looked at, and studied,  its testing system, but did nothing about it. It would always be inadequate and slow for a large scale pandemic, but a pandemic would never happen, they hoped. President Obama made changes that only complicated things further\u2026.. \u2014 Donald J.

The government has confirmed 15,369 dengue cases since Jan. 1. Of those, 9,683 patients were diagnosed between July 1 and July 30. As of Tuesday, about 4,400 patients, including many children, were undergoing hospital treatment. There have been 14 deaths. Officials from Dhaka, the overcrowded capital and the epicenter of the outbreak, have struggled to contain it, drawing criticism and spreading panic among some residents. Dengue is found in tropical areas around the world and is spread by a type of mosquito that mainly lives in urban areas. The virus causes severe flu-like symptoms, and while there is no specific treatment for the illness, medical care to maintain a person\u2019s fluid levels is seen as critical. There are fears that the situation in the countryside will worsen as many residents of the city travel to villages to celebrate Eid-ul-Adha next month. Infected humans can serve as a source of the virus for uninfected mosquitoes. Ayesha Akhter, assistant director at the Directorate General of Health Services under the Ministry of Health, said an outbreak of dengue has accompanied every monsoon since 2000, but this year\u2019s situation is the worst. A DGHS study identified a six-fold increase in the Aedes aegypti mosquito population in four months in Dhaka as the primary cause of the larger-than-average outbreak. Earlier this month, the World Health Organization said the dengue situation in Bangladesh was \u201calarming but not out of control.\u201d Other countries in Asia are also facing a surge in dengue cases this year, including Thailand, where 53,699 cases and 65 deaths were reported as of July 23. Nevertheless, with dengue cases soaring in recent weeks, Dhaka hospitals have been running out of room and manpower to treat new patients. Prof. Abul Kalam Azad, director general of DGHS, said they had asked the hospitals to increase beds for dengue patients and to open dengue wards. The government also halved the charges for diagnosing dengue and directed public and private hospitals, clinics and diagnostic centers to do the same. Dhaka Medical College Hospital, the largest hospital in the country, opened a special ward for dengue patients, said A.K.M. Nasir Uddin, its director general. Prof. Uttam Kumar Barua, director of Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College and Hospital, another major public hospital in Dhaka, said they were relying on senior medical students to assist doctors in the face of so many patients. \u201cWe don\u2019t have manpower, logistic support and technicians as much as needed. That\u2019s why we are having too much pressure. We have three times more patients than our bed capacity,\u201d Barua said. He said they were admitting every dengue patient who entered the hospital but could not provide beds or even seats for everyone, adding that many had been asked to wait in hospital corridors and verandas. Champa Begum took her 8-month-old to Shaheed hospital on Wednesday. \u201cI have other kids. I go to work leaving this one to another child.

Their study, published this month in the online journal PeerJ, compared work done in the channel to nearby coral. It puts at odds two governmental agencies that clashed over the dredge. Environmentalists had long worried that that $205 million dredging would damage the coral. The Miami Herald (http://hrld.us/2gFJYNi ) reports the Corps contended a disease outbreak was responsible. State environmental regulators argued that mud stirred up by the dredge or leaked by a barge as it ferried sediment offshore smothered coral. The research team studied pictures taken before, during and after the dredge and said sediment spread across an area about 14 times bigger than the Corps permit allowed for. The study found that warm temperatures in the summer of 2014 triggered widespread bleaching and disease and the coral \u2014 stressed by the sediment \u2014 died in larger numbers than nearby coral. The project deepened the port\u2019s channel by 6 feet, making it 52-feet deep. It completes a $1 billion makeover that includes a new tunnel at the port. \u201cWe now know the Corps dramatically underestimated both the severity and the geographic extent of the sediment impacts on the reef,\u201d said Miami Waterkeeper Rachel Silverstein, whose group joined other conservationists in a legal fight to clean up the dredge. \u201cThe monitoring and the protocols that were supposed to protect this reef during the dredge clearly failed and this study is providing peer-reviewed, statistically valid evidence showing that impacts from the dredging resulted in widespread impacts.\u201d Beginning in the summer of 2015, the fisheries service repeatedly warned the Corps that damage appeared to be more widespread and the agency was in danger of violating its permit. The Herald reports that the Corps also failed to provide updated surveys of the work, which prompted the fisheries service to issue a sharp letter accusing the agency of selectively choosing \u201ccertain results to downplay the permanent effects\u201d of the dredge. Corps officials said the study used limited data and failed to distinguish between the types of sediment that buried coral during the dredge. \u201cDrawing broad scale conclusions based on limited data is very misleading and not good science,\u201d Corps spokeswoman Susan Jackson told the Herald via email. She said the agency is \u201ccommitted to understanding potential impacts\u201d and has expanded monitoring efforts, which include cameras on the ocean floor to record conditions.

The quake was centered about 7 miles (12 kilometers) north of Anchorage, which has a population of about 300,000. People ran from their offices or took cover under desks. A 5.7 aftershock arrived within minutes, followed by a series of smaller quakes. The two big back-to-back quakes knocked items off shelves, disrupted power, broke store windows and briefly triggered a tsunami warning for islands and coastal areas south of the city. Walker issued a disaster declaration, and President Donald Trump declared an emergency, allowing the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate disaster relief. There were no reports of deaths or serious injuries. Still, aftershocks Saturday continued to fray nerves, with people worrying about being caught in more massive shakers. \u201cThey\u2019re disturbing, and I\u2019m not putting anything away that could fall until they calm down,\u201d Randall Cavanugh, an Anchorage attorney, said following a restless night at home. \u201cI kept waking up.\u201d By mid-morning, there had been about 550 aftershocks, including 11 with magnitudes of 4.5 or greater, Caruso said. The aftershocks should be weaker and less frequent in the coming days, but officials can\u2019t say for sure when they\u2019ll stop, he said.

He also credited building codes for minimizing structure damage. \u201cIn terms of a disaster, I think it says more about who we are than what we suffered,\u201d he said Saturday at a press briefing, adding that Anchorage was prepared for such an emergency. \u201cPeople pulled together. We followed the plans that were in place. We looked after one another. And when people around the country and around the world look at this, they\u2019re going to say, \u2019We want to do things in the Anchorage way because Anchorage did this right,\u201d Berkowitz said. After the first earthquake, Alaska\u2019s largest hospital activated its incident command center, but the trickle of patients into the emergency room at Providence Alaska Medical Center in Anchorage was more like a normal workday and not a mass casualty event. The injuries were described as minor, and there were no patients with life-threatening conditions. \u201cThe flow of patients into the emergency department was similar to a typical Monday,\u201d hospital spokesman Mikal Canfield said Saturday. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a situation where there was a mass rush of people.\u201d Roads didn\u2019t fare so well, as reports of extensive damage came in. The Alaska Department of Transportation counted about 50 sites with damage, including eight considered major. Most of the damage was to highways north of Anchorage. The agency also was planning to conduct bridge inspections Saturday. Transportation officials said in a release that the aftershocks continue to contribute to settling and additional cracking. Rock falls exacerbated by the aftershocks were causing some problems on the Seward Highway south of Anchorage. Normal operations resumed at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport after flight operations were suspended Friday, Transportation Department spokesman Meadow Bailey told The Associated Press. The 800-mile (1,287-kilometer) trans Alaska oil pipeline was shut down for hours while crews were sent to inspect it for damage. Michelle Egan with Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., the pipeline operator, said the line was restarted at 3:30 p.m. Friday. She said there are no obvious signs of damage and no operational impact on the pipeline, whose closest section is 120 miles (193 kilometers) from the epicenter. Anchorage\u2019s school system canceled classes through Tuesday while it examined buildings for damage. Alaska\u2019s 1964 earthquake, with a 9.2 magnitude, was centered about 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of Anchorage. It and the tsunami it triggered claimed about 130 lives. The state averages 40,000 earthquakes a year, with more large quakes than the 49 other states combined.

Here\u2019s a summary of their cases. \u2022 Anwar al-Awlaki. Al-Awlaki, a U.S.-born citizen of Yemeni descent, was hunted by the U.S. and killed in a drone strike in September 2011. He was reportedly a key adviser, and even an instigator, in several terrorist incidents involving U.S. targets, including the 2009 killing of 13 and wounding of more than 30 by a shooter at Fort Hood, Texas; the 2009 plot to explode a plane in Detroit using an \"\"underwear\"\" bomb; and the foiled attempt to plant a bomb in New York City\u2019s Times Square in 2010. By the time of his death, Al-Awlaki \"\"had been under the scrutiny of American officials for more than a decade,\"\" the New York Times reported. \"\"He first came under FBI investigation in 1999 because of associations with militants and was questioned after the 2001 terrorist attacks about his contacts with three of the hijackers at his mosques in San Diego and Virginia.\"\" \u2022 David Headley. Headley, a Pakistani-American born as Daood Gilani, is serving a 35-year sentence for helping organize scouting missions for a 2008 terrorist attack in Mumbai, India, that left 160 dead. In the late 1990s, Headley had served as a confidential informant for the Drug Enforcement Agency and was sent on one mission to Lahore, Pakistan, in which he infiltrated heroin trafficking networks. But later, his actions raised questions among friends and acquaintances. \"\"A former girlfriend of Headley\u2019s told a bartender named Terry O\u2019Donnell that he wanted to go to Pakistan to fight alongside Islamic militants,\"\" ProPublica reported, adding that O\u2019Donnell subsequently contacted an FBI-led task force that was investigating the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. On Oct. 4, 2001, \"\"two Defense Department agents working for the task force questioned him in front of his DEA handlers at the drug agency\u2019s office.\"\" \u2022 Abdulhakim Muhammed. Muhammed, a convert to Islam who was born Carlos Bledsoe, pled guilty to killing Pvt. William Long and wounding Pvt. Quinton Ezeagwula outside a U.S. Army recruiting station in Little Rock, Ark., in 2009. He is now serving life in prison. Muhammed had been under investigation by the FBI's Joint Terrorist Task Force. \"\"The investigation was in its preliminary stages, authorities said, and was based on the suspect's travel to Yemen and his arrest there for using a Somali passport,\"\" ABC News reported. ABC also reported that his \"\"travel within the United States had also come under scrutiny by the Terrorist Task Force, including travel to Columbus, Ohio \u2013 an area of domestic concern for authorities who have observed a number of Somali Americans traveling from there to Somali to wage jihad.\"\" \u2022 Nidal Hasan. Hasan, a psychiatrist and major in the U.S. Army Medical Corps, is the only suspect in the Fort Hood shootings and is awaiting a military trial that could bring the death penalty. Prior to the shootings, the government intercepted at least 18 emails between Hasan and al-Awlaki. They were \"\"passed along to two Joint Terrorism Task Force cells led by the FBI, but a senior defense official said no one at the Defense Department knew about the messages until after the shootings,\"\" the Associated Press reported. The FBI and military officials offered divergent reasons for the failure to pass along the messages. \"\"FBI officials have said a military investigator on the task force saw the emails and looked up Hasan's record, but finding nothing particularly worrisome, the investigator neither sought nor got permission to pass the emails on to other military officials,\"\" the AP reported. A senior defense official countered that \"\"the rules of the task force prevented that military representative from passing the records on without approval from other members of the task force.\"\" One additional case shares some aspects of the pattern King laid out -- that of Umar Farook Abdulmutallab, the \"\"underwear bomber.\"\" But since his plot was foiled and he did not go on to \"\"carry out terrorist murders,\"\" his case doesn\u2019t make King\u2019s list. (In Abdulmutallab\u2019s case, the National Security Agency had intercepted a discussion in Yemen that referenced the plot, but analysts did not link these intercepts with a separate piece of information, that Adbulmutallab\u2019s father \"\"visited the United States Embassy in Nigeria to express concerns about his son\u2019s radicalization,\"\" according to the New York Times.) We asked Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism expert who is a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, for his thoughts on King\u2019s list. He agreed that Hasan\u2019s case qualified as a good example of government officials determining (misguidedly, as it turned out) that an individual was \"\"no threat.\"\" He added that he thought Al-Awlaki and Muhammed fit the pattern to a significant degree, but not entirely. In their cases, while the U.S. government did not immediately step in to arrest either man, it\u2019s not clear that the U.S. government went so far as to determine that they were \"\"no threat,\"\" Gartenstein-Ross said. The weakest example, Gartenstein-Ross said, is Headley, whose case is murky for several reasons, including his role as a U.S. government informant. Seven years elapsed between his interview in 2001 and the Mumbai attack in 2008 -- a long enough time to raise questions about whether he was sufficiently radicalized to have given government officials reason to believe he was on a path to terrorism. Our ruling King said the Boston Marathon bombing \"\"is the fifth case\"\" in which U.S. government officials examined individuals potentially involved in terrorism \"\"and felt they were no threat and they went on to carry out terrorist murders.\"\" It\u2019s clear that there are at least four prior instances -- Anwar al-Awlaki, David Headley, Abdulhakim Muhammed and Nidal Hasan -- that fit the pattern of someone being on the government\u2019s radar screen and later allegedly committing terrorist acts. But in at least one of these cases, and to a lesser extent two others, it\u2019s not clear that the government determined that the individuals \"\"were no threat\"\" based on the initial round of scrutiny.\"", "output": "\"The Boston Marathon bombing \"\"is the fifth case\"\" in which U.S. government officials examined individuals potentially involved in terrorism \"\"and felt they were no threat and they went on to carry out terrorist murders.\"", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "The jury voted 11-1 to deny damages to Nora Daniels, 55, of Columbia, Tennessee, who said she used Johnson & Johnson\u2019s talcum powder from 1978 to 2013, when she was diagnosed with ovarian and uterine cancer. She also sued Imerys Talc, a talcum powder supplier, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported (http://bit.ly/2lF7Q0Z ). The verdict for Johnson & Johnson came after three previous St. Louis juries awarded a total of $197 million to the plaintiffs who made similar claims. About 2,000 state and federal lawsuits are in courts across the country over concerns about health problems caused by prolonged talcum powder use. Daniels\u2019 lawyer, Jim Onder, said he thinks the difference between Friday\u2019s verdict and the three previous St. Louis cases was that this jury didn\u2019t think the talcum powder contributed to Daniels\u2019 specific type of cancer. Johnson & Johnson spokeswoman Carol Goodrich said in a statement the company sympathizes with ovarian cancer patients. \u201cThe jury\u2019s decision is consistent with the science, research, clinical evidence and decades of studies by medical experts around the world that continue to support the safety of cosmetic talc,\u201d the statement said, while citing two cases thrown out in New Jersey in September 2016 when a judge found insufficient scientific evidence for the claims against talcum powder. Imerys spokeswoman Gwen Myers said in a statement the jury followed \u201cthe science that establishes the safety of talc.\u201d \u201cImerys sympathizes with women suffering from ovarian cancer and hopes that the scientific community\u2019s efforts will continue to be directed toward finding the true causes of this terrible disease,\u201d the statement said. Juror Luke Wilson, 34, of St. Louis, said the jury did not think evidence linking talcum powder with ovarian cancer was strong enough to require Johnson & Johnson to put warning labels on its products. The only dissenting juror, George Stair, 76, of St. Louis, said he thought there was enough evidence. \u201cI wish we could have sent a message to Johnson & Johnson to put a warning on the product label,\u201d he said. ___ Information from: St. Louis Post-Dispatch, http://www.stltoday.com", "output": "St. Louis jury rejects lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "\"On Nov. 27, 2013, a Madison-based liberal advocacy group used a mass email to promote protests that were planned against Walmart stores for two days later -- Black Friday. The demonstrations aimed to \"\"expose Wal-Mart\u2019s shameful labor practices and support workers,\"\" according to One Wisconsin Now, which then made this claim: \"\"The Walton family, which owns Wal-Mart, controls a fortune equal to the wealth of the bottom 42 percent of Americans combined.\"\" That reminded us of a March 2011 claim by filmmaker and liberal activist Michael Moore. He said in a Madison speech that 400 Americans have more wealth than half of all Americans combined. Based on online hits, it became one of our most popular fact-checks ever. So we wondered about the Walmart claim. Wealth, not income In the days before and after Black Friday, leaders no less prominent than President Barack Obama and Pope Francis decried the extent of income disparity in the United States and around the world. Obama called the growing income gap a \"\"defining challenge of our time.\"\" The pope said that while the earnings of a minority \"\"are growing exponentially, so, too, is the gap separating the majority from the prosperity enjoyed by those happy few.\"\" Walmart, of course, is a big target. According to Forbes, as of May 2013 the international retailer had $469 billion in sales and 2.2 million employees, including 1.3 million in the United States. The corporation has been criticized for low wages; and in December 2012, PolitiFact National rated as Mostly  a claim that more Walmart employees are on Medicaid and food stamps than other companies. But let\u2019s be clear up front: Although income and wealth are related, they\u2019re not the same. Wealth is commonly measured in terms of net worth -- the value of a person\u2019s assets minus liabilities. So, things like savings and retirement accounts, minus what is owed on a home mortgage, credit cards, etc. That means a person with heavy debt can have little wealth, or negative wealth, even while earning a six-figure income. One more point before we get to the wealth figures. Walmart was founded by the late Sam Walton, who opened the first store in Arkansas in 1962. Walmart incorporated in 1969 and became a publicly traded company a year later. So, Wal-Mart is not family owned, but rather owned by its stockholders; on the other hand, according to Bloomberg and other news reports, the Walton family members still have control of the company, owning about half of the shares. Group's evidence Scot Ross, One Wisconsin Now's executive director, told us his evidence to back his group\u2019s claim is a July 2012 article by economist Josh Bivens, research and policy director of the liberal Economics Policy Institute in Washington, D.C. Bivens wrote that in 2010, the wealth of six Walton family heirs was $89.5 billion, 22 percent higher than in 2007. Meanwhile, the median wealth of American families in 2010 was $77,300, nearly 39 percent lower than three years earlier. (Median wealth refers to the American family that is exactly wealthier than half of all families and less wealthy than half.) As for measuring one against the other, Bivens said the Walton family wealth in 2010 was as large as the wealth of the bottom 48.8 million families in the United States, or 41.5 percent of all American families. Rounded up, 41.5 percent would be 42 percent, the figure One Wisconsin Now claims. But let's keep shopping around a little. Similar claim It turns out that a statement nearly identical to the one made by One Wisconsin Now was uttered in July 2012 by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats. Sanders said the Walton family owns \"\"more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of America,\"\" a claim PolitiFact National rated . Our colleagues found that Sylvia Allegretto, a labor economist at the University of California, Berkeley, compared the Waltons\u2019 cumulative net worth with that of the overall population, as cited in the Federal Reserve\u2019s Survey of Consumer Finances. That survey was published in August 2012. Allegretto found that the Waltons\u2019 wealth in 2010 was valued at $89.5 billion -- equal to the entire bottom 41.5 percent of American families. The 2010 figures are the latest available for doing comparisons with the net worth of the overall population. But we found, using the Forbes 400 list for 2013, that the wealth of six of Sam Walton\u2019s descendants has continued to grow. Here are their rankings and their wealth: No. 6 Christy Walton (daughter-in-law), $35.4 billion No. 7: Jim Walton (son), $33.8 billion No. 8: Alice Walton (daughter), $33.5 billion No. 9: S. Robson Walton (son), $33.3 billion No. 95: Ann Walton Kroenke (niece), $4.7 billion No. 110: Nancy Walton Laurie (niece), $4 billion Total Walton family wealth: $144.7 billion. A note before we close: Allegretto told us the housing crisis is a key reason that the gap between the Walton family wealth and the wealth of other American families has grown. More Americans were left with \"\"negative wealth\"\" because they lost their biggest asset -- their home -- and often significant amounts of their savings, as well, she said.

A new type of snub-nosed monkey has been found in a remote forested region of northern Myanmar which is under threat from logging and a Chinese dam project, scientists said on Wednesday. They said hunters in Myanmar's Kachin state said the long-tailed black monkey, with white-tufted ears and a white beard, could often be tracked in the rain because its upturned nostrils made it prone to sneezing when water dripped in. REUTERS/Dr Thomas Geissmann/Fauna & Flora International/Handout They said hunters in Myanmar\u2019s Kachin state said the long-tailed black monkey, with white-tufted ears and a white beard, could often be tracked in the rain because its upturned nostrils made it prone to sneezing when water dripped in. \u201cIt\u2019s new to science. It\u2019s unusual to travel to a remote area and discover a monkey that looks unlike any other in the world,\u201d Thomas Geissmann, lead author of the study at the University of Zurich-Irchel, told Reuters. Studies of a carcass and four skulls showed the monkey differed from snub-nosed monkeys in China and Vietnam. The experts had no photos of a live Myanmar monkey. The scientists estimated there were between 260 and 330 of the monkeys living in an area of about 270 sq km (100 sq miles) and believed the species to be critically endangered. \u201cThe hunting pressure is likely to increase considerably in the next few years as new dam construction and logging roads invade\u201d the monkeys\u2019 habitat, they wrote in the American Journal of Primatology. \u201cThe future of the snub-nosed monkey lies in Chinese hands,\u201d said Frank Momberg, of Fauna and Flora International and a co-author of the study. Monkeys were hunted for meat or fur and their body parts were used in traditional medicines in China. He said China Power Investment Corp., leading the dam project further down the valley on a tributary of the Irrawaddy River in Myanmar, had an economic interest in preserving the forested region where the monkeys live. More roads and logging would cause erosion around the watershed that could clog up the new reservoir with silt, reducing power generation, he said. He praised China for carrying out a study of the dam\u2019s possible effect on the environment. The discovery of the snub-nosed monkey contrasts with a rising trend of extinctions, caused by factors such as land clearance, expansion of cities, pollution and climate change. A U.N. conference in Nagoya, Japan, this week is looking at ways to safeguard biological diversity after the world failed in a goal set in 2002 of a \u201csignificant reduction\u201d in the pace of extinctions of animals and plants by 2010.

Gen. Peter Chiarelli discussed the study on This Week with Christiane Amanpour. The study documented complex pressures -- including overly long deployments, more tolerance for high-risk behavior among soldiers and lax standards for leaders keeping tabs on their soldiers. Another complicating factor: increased use of prescription antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs and pain medications. \"\"We know that we had over 106,000 soldiers last year who had a prescription of three weeks or more for some kind of antidepressant, anti-anxiety medicine,\"\" said Chiarelli. A few moments later, he added, \"\"A portion of those 106,000 soldiers that I told you are on some kind of pain medication, it has nothing to do with a behavior health issue. There are soldiers who have been on two, three, four deployments, hucking a rucksack filled with equipment that may weigh 70 to 80 pounds at 8,000 feet, and they've got a knee injury or a leg injury that is painful. Probably should stay home and get operated on, but they go back for the second deployment, and they're on some kind of a pain medication. We have soldiers who suck it up all the time and hide from their leaders when they're hurt.\"\" Chiarelli was referring to information in the Army's Health Promotion, Risk Reduction, and Suicide Prevention Report, released Aug. 5, 2010. This seemed like an important issue to explore further. The report explains that historically, the Army's suicide rate has been much lower than the civilian population's. But the Army's rate began increasing in 2004 and surpassed the national average in 2008. That year, the suicide rate in the Army was 20.2 per 100,000, compared with a typical civilian rate of 19.2. This increase prompted the study. \"\"In Fiscal Year (FY) 2009, 160 active duty Soldiers took their lives, making suicide the third leading cause of death among the Army population,\"\" the study states. \"\"If we include accidental death, which frequently is the result of high risk behavior (drinking and driving, drug overdose, etc. ), we find that less young men and women die in combat than die by their own actions. Simply stated, we are often more dangerous to ourselves than the enemy.\"\" The report affirms the 106,000 number that Chiarelli uses. \"\"Latest accounts estimate that approximately 106,000 Soldiers are prescribed some form of pain, depression or anxiety medications. The potential for abuse is obvious,\"\" it states. The report also discusses whether these and other prescription drugs are being abused by members of the military:  \"\"There is concern that potential prescription drug abuse is masked in our current system. This is the result of the increase in prescriptions which expands the population authorized to use pharmaceuticals. For example, the growing population who has obtained prescriptions for amphetamines has resulted in an increased rate of authorized use. Unfortunately, there is no definitive method to ascertain if the use was authorized or illicit. As a result, we have masked a subset of that population who are either dependent or illicitly use drugs. Ultimately, if left unchecked, this gap facilitates a population of drug addicts and distributors.\"\" The report also notes that many soldiers are aged 18 to 29, and there are continuing questions about the use of antidepressants -- specifically, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) -- among young people, and whether these medications sometimes increase the risk of suicide. \"\"The Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) is cognizant of this issue and is investigating the use of these and other medications to better manage care,\"\" the report states. The report makes additional observations about prescription drug users in the military. Pain medications seem to be more common than antidepressants or anti-anxiety drugs; \"\"14% of the force is taking some form of opiate medication,\"\" according to the report. The percentage for antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications appear somewhat lower, with between 3 and 6 percent of the deployed force receiving such medication, according to evidence the report cites. Anecdotal evidence in the report indicates some soldiers receive multiple prescriptions for pain and depression. We should emphasize the study draws no hard conclusions about the role that prescription drugs play in military suicides. \"\"The impact of increased use of antidepressant, psychiatric and narcotic pain management medications has not been comprehensively studied in a military population,\"\" the report states. In the interview with Amanpour, Chiarelli rejected the idea that soldiers were overly medicated. \"\"We know that the drugs that we're talking about are cleared by the CENTCOM surgeon for soldiers to be taking when they're downrange. So we're not sending any soldier into harm's way who is taking a drug that we feel would somehow endanger him or others,\"\" he said. Finally, we should note that the report links policing potential drug addiction to military leadership in a section titled \"\"The Lost Art of Leadership in Garrison.\"\" The Army has been transformed in recent years, the report states, so that combat readiness has been emphasized more than \"\"good order and discipline practices.\"\" Unannounced health and welfare checks and inspections \"\"have been lost\"\" as part of that transition. \"\"There are instances where a leader\u2019s lack of Soldier accountability resulted in suicide victims not being found until they had been dead for three or four weeks,\"\" the report noted. While the report raises a host of issues, we're only ruling on what the general said about the rate of medication among soldiers.

The government has \u201cbeen trying to address HIV, but never in such a focused way,\u201d he said. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS. \u201cTogether, we will defeat AIDS in America and beyond,\u201d Trump said in his speech. He pledged funding in his upcoming budget, but did not say how much. Trump\u2019s move is being greeted with a mix of skepticism and cautious optimism by anti-AIDS activists. They\u2019re flagging his previous efforts to slash Medicaid health care for low-income people, and his administration\u2019s ongoing drive to roll back newly won acceptance for LGBTQ people. \u201cWe stand ready to work with him and his administration if they are serious,\u201d said a statement from AIDS United and other groups. \u201cBut to date, this administration\u2019s actions speak louder than words and have moved us in the wrong direction.\u201d AIDS United funds and advocates policies to combat AIDS. The ONE Campaign, the global anti-poverty group co-founded by rock singer Bono, called Trump\u2019s pledge a \u201cwelcome sign,\u201d but pointed out that the administration has also proposed deep cuts in U.S. funding for efforts to battle HIV in Africa. \u201cWhile we might have policy differences with the president and his administration, this initiative, if properly implemented and resourced, can go down in history as one of the most significant achievements of his presidency,\u201d Michael Ruppal, executive director of the AIDS Institute, said in a statement. While Azar said significant new funding would be included in the president\u2019s budget, he also emphasized that the campaign is about making more efficient use of existing programs like the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, which provides medical care and support services. \u201cThe tools are there,\u201d Azar said. \u201cThis is about execution.\u201d Today\u2019s HIV treatments work so well they not only can give people with the AIDS virus a near-normal life expectancy, they offer a double whammy \u2014 making those patients less likely to infect other people. At the same time, a longtime HIV medication named Truvada can prevent infection if taken daily by healthy people who are at risk from their infected sexual partners, a strategy known as \u201cpre-exposure prophylaxis\u201d or PreP. The people most at risk include men who have sex with men, minorities, particularly African-Americans, and American Indians/Alaska Natives. Azar said the administration\u2019s campaign would rely on public health workers to identify people at risk for HIV/AIDS, get them tested, and on medication. The 48 counties HHS is focusing on are mainly metro areas. The states are Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma and South Carolina. Researchers noted that will require working with groups that often shun health services, including injectable drug users. \u201cTrust is a crucial weapon in our fight to eradicate HIV and it\u2019s necessary to encourage people from marginalized groups to get tested,\u201d said Dr. Albert Wu, an HIV researcher at Johns Hopkins University. The initial goal is to reduce new HIV infections by 75 percent in five years. There are about 40,000 new cases of HIV infections a year in the U.S. That\u2019s a dramatic reduction from the crisis years of the AIDS epidemic, but progress has stalled. More than 1 million Americans live with the disease. William McColl of AIDS United said the Trump administration\u2019s goal is \u201cvery doable,\u201d based on currently available technology and trends. \u201cI think the HIV community would work with the administration on this issue if they\u2019re serious, but it\u2019s also going to take real action, including possibly regulatory and legislative changes to achieve the goal,\u201d said McColl. Azar said the idea for the new push came from within the ranks of HHS. \u201cThere was a recognition that we were facing a unique and historic moment where all the strands were coming together,\u201d said Azar. They took the idea to Trump. \u201cPresident Trump is personally invested in this,\u201d said Azar. In recent years a number of health organizations, including the United Nations, have called for coordinated steps to end the HIV epidemic by 2030.

The video was published just one year after YouTube was created. Before the prominence of social media, it was shared by email: The attached video is of dolphins playing with silver colored rings which they have the ability to make under water to play with. It isn\u2019t known how they learn this, or if it\u2019s an inbred ability. The dolphin does a quick flip of its head and a silver ring appears in front of its pointed beak. The ring is a solid, donut shaped bubble about 2-ft across, yet it doesn\u2019t rise to the surface of the water. The dolphin then pulls a small silver donut from the larger one. Looking at the twisting ring for one last time a bite is taken from it, causing the small ring to collapse into a thousands of tiny bubbles which head upward towards the water\u2019s surface. After a few moments the dolphin creates another ring to play with. There also seems to be a separate mechanism for producing small rings, which a dolphin can accomplish by a quick flip of its head. An explanation of how dolphins make these silver rings is that they are \u201cair-core vortex rings\u201d. Invisible, spinning vortices in the water are generated from the tip of a dolphin\u2019s dorsal fin when it is moving rapidly and turning. When dolphins break the line, the ends are drawn together into a closed ring. The higher velocity fluid around the core of the vortex is at a lower pressure than the fluid circulating farther away. Air is injected into the rings via bubbles released from the dolphin\u2019s blowhole. The energy of the water vortex is enough to keep the bubbles from rising for a reasonably few seconds of play time. We don\u2019t know the specific origins of this video clip, but bottlenose dolphins\u2019 producing and manipulating bubble rings is indeed a real phenomenon that has been observed and described by researchers, as noted in the 2000 article \u201cBubble Ring Play of Bottlenose Dolphins: Implications for Cognition,\u201d published in the Journal of Comparative Psychology: Ongoing research into the cognitive capabilities of dolphins and other cetaceans has captured the interest and imagination of both the scientific community and the public. Bottlenose dolphins are gregarious mammals that show a strong propensity for play behavior with physical objects and with [each other]. There have been previous reports that both captive and wild dolphins produce their own objects of play, termed \u201cbubble rings\u201d. During these events, dolphins expel air from their blowhole, and the expelled air rises to the surface in a torus or ringlike form. Air-breathing dolphins always produce bubbles when they expel air underwater. Besides bubble rings, dolphins also produce a wide variety of other bubble types. They occasionally emit bubble streams concurrent with vocal activity. When surprised, curious, or excited, dolphins often emit a rapid exhalation termed a \u201cbubble burst\u201d. Breathing in dolphins, unlike in other mammals, is solely under voluntary control, a crucial feature in their adaptation to a fully aquatic existence. Whereas the physics of ring formation is straightforward, the actual production of stable rings may require some practice, expertise, and forethought by the dolphins. Dolphins in different oceanariums have been reported to produce bubble rings. For example, dolphins would swim to the bottom of the pool, stop, assume a horizontal position, and then with a sharp upward jerk of the head, expel a ring of air through their blowhole. Dolphins frequently manipulate their bubble rings by generating vortices around the objects, which cause the bubble rings to turn vertically by 90\u00b0 or flip in orientation 180\u00b0. Bubble play can result in a sequence of two bubble rings, such that the second bubble ring joins the first bubble ring to form a large bubble ring, which is often then further manipulated. Sometimes a third smaller bubble ring extrudes from the larger ring as a result of the force of impact between the first and second bubble rings. This third bubble ring is frequently manipulated by the dolphins in a similar manner as described above for single rings where the dolphins vertically turn the bubble ring or completely flip the ring. A 1996 episode of \u201cNoorderlicht\u201d featured Dr. Ken Marten explaining the bubble rings and the intelligence of dolphins. The TV show was a Dutch scientific documentary series.

The fresh produce program gives low-sodium, low-sugar foods to the poorest Americans year-round, including during the holiday season often associated with canned-food drives. \u201cWe picked a thousand pounds this weekend and we\u2019ll do another thousand next week,\u201d Shick, the food bank\u2019s agricultural director said, while standing in a greenhouse where the program grows seedlings in a suburban Philadelphia park. Chester County is among about 20 food banks across the country that have started their own farms to boost healthier eating by the needy, said Domenic Vitiello, a University of Pennsylvania professor who has studied food pantry agricultural operations. Low-income Americans are a demographic often plagued by diet-related ailments such as diabetes and heart disease. Chester County Food Bank opened about five years ago, springing from the ashes of a similar program that relied on nearby Amish farmers. It was started explicitly with the goal of distributing food straight from the field. Canned food that is often donated to food banks because of its long shelf life is typically higher in sodium, which the American Heart Association says may increase risk for heart failure. People with diabetes also are encouraged to limit the sodium in their daily diet to 1,500 mg to help prevent or control high blood pressure, according to Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston. \u201cThe cans we\u2019ve gotten in through the years - it\u2019s not the healthiest stuff,\u201d said Larry Welsch, Chester County Food Bank\u2019s executive director. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten cans of pickled cactus with 2,800 (milli) grams of sodium.\u201d  \u201cWhen we formed this food bank,\u201d Welsch said, \u201cit wasn\u2019t going to be cans in, cans out.\u201d  The farming effort has offered the public new ways to contribute to the food pantry. \u201cPeople are very excited to volunteer in the field,\u201d Shick said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t stuffing envelopes and putting cans in a box.\u201d  In three growing houses in Chester County\u2019s Springton Manor Farm park, the food bank cultivates seedlings for its partners, including private farmers and corporations such as Endo Health Solutions and Malvern, Pennsylvania-based Vanguard Group. Some schools use the seedlings to grow vegetables for student lunches, others raise their own crops in horticulture and culinary programs, and donate to the food bank what they do not use. The charity grows food on more than a dozen acres spread across multiple sites. To supplement its crop yield, the food bank buys from a farm auction in nearby Lancaster County. Fresh produce makes up about 22 percent of the edibles the Chester County Food Bank distributes. It ranks sixth-highest in the nation for the amount of fresh produce it distributes as a percentage of all the food it gives out, according to statistics compiled by a University of Pennsylvania researcher. Growing produce allows food banks to distribute a wider variety, including leafy greens, Shick said. But it also means footing the expense of buying commercial refrigerators and refrigerated trucks, said Ross Fraser, a spokesman for the nonprofit Feeding America. Those costly hurdles have slowed the transition of food cupboards away from canned goods able to last for months in church basements and toward often more nutritious, but perishable food. Nationwide, most food bank agricultural programs are still in the experimental stages, but they share some characteristics, Vitiello said. They are usually located in wealthier areas because of the start-up expense, and they tend to have educational components that can be just as important as feeding people. Chester County is Pennsylvania\u2019s wealthiest, with an economy buoyed by the pharmaceutical industry. But it also has pockets of poverty, particularly in the Kennett Square area, where there are numerous migrant farm workers who pick mushrooms; and Coatesville, a city whose fortunes have declined as a local steel mill closed and then re-opened with fewer jobs. Food bank farming programs have important roles to play in educating people to cook and use healthier food, Vitiello said. \u201cWhen these programs are training low-income people in learning how to produce their own food, they\u2019re playing a different role in the food system and promoting food justice,\u201d Vitiello said.", "output": "Amid holiday canned-food drives, U.S. food banks take up farming.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "Scientists made an impassioned appeal to governments and businesses worldwide to confront \u201cvested interests\u201d they said were blocking reforms in farming, energy and mining needed to save the Earth\u2019s ecosystems. \u201cIf we want to leave a world for our children and grandchildren that has not been destroyed by human activity, we need to act now,\u201d said Robert Watson, who chaired the study, produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), which groups 130 countries, including the United States, Russia and China. \u201cIf we do not act now, many of the million threatened species will become as extinct as the dodo on this tie,\u201d Watson told a news conference in Paris, gesturing to his tie, which bore a design of the flightless bird. Known as the Global Assessment, the report found that up to one million of Earth\u2019s estimated eight million plant, insect and animal species is at risk of extinction, many within decades. It identified industrial farming and fishing as major drivers of the crisis, with the current rate of species extinction tens to hundreds of times higher than the average over the last 10 million years. Climate change caused by burning the coal, oil and gas produced by the fossil fuel industry is exacerbating the losses, the report found. \u201cWe are facing a human extinction crisis,\u201d said Hoda Baraka of 350.org, a climate change campaign group based in the United States. \u201cWe must work together to push back against the fossil fuel industry fuelling the climate crisis and for long-lasting and meaningful change.\u201d  The largest, most comprehensive study ever undertaken of the conjoined fates of human wellbeing and the natural world, the report was finalised in Paris after intense negotiations between IPBES members that concluded at 0300 a.m. on Saturday. The report represents a cornerstone of an emerging body of research that suggests the world may need to embrace a new \u201cpost-growth\u201d form of economics if it is to avert the existential risks posed by the cascading effects of pollution, habitat destruction and climate change. Compiled over three years and based on 15,000 scientific papers, the report identified a range of risks, from the disappearance of insects vital for pollinating food crops, to the destruction of coral reefs that support fish populations and the loss of medicinal plants. The threatened list includes more than 40 percent of amphibian species, almost 33 percent of reef-forming corals, sharks and shark relatives, and more than a third of all marine mammals. The picture was less clear for insect species, but a tentative estimate suggests 10 per cent could become extinct. Publication of the report has coincided with an upsurge in environmental activism by groups including Extinction Rebellion, whose civil disobedience campaign forced the British parliament this month to declare a climate emergency. The report\u2019s blunt language echoed the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which said in October that profound economic and social changes would be needed to curb greenhouse gases quickly enough to avert the most devastating consequences of a warming world. The findings will also add to pressure for countries to agree bold action to protect wildlife at a major conference on biodiversity due to take place in China towards the end of next year, reinforcing a growing recognition among policy-makers that the extinction and climate crises are deeply interconnected. \u201cWe have reconfigured dramatically the life of the planet,\u201d said Eduardo Brondizio, a professor of anthropology at Indiana University in the United States who co-chaired the report. \u201cThe key message: business as usual has to end.\u201d", "output": "Scientists warn a million species at risk of extinction.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "\"There was no discussion of costs of vegetable consumption.

About 500 current and former students have now made accusations against Tyndall and filed various lawsuits. They contend he routinely made crude comments, took inappropriate photos, forced them to strip naked and groped them under the guise of medical treatment. Tyndall spent about three decades as a USC staff gynecologist before retiring last year after a university investigation concluded there was evidence that he sexually harassed students during exams. Tyndall has denied the allegations and has not been charged with a crime. Los Angeles police and Los Angeles County prosecutors are reviewing the claims. His attorney, Leonard Levine, said in a statement that Tyndall \u201ccontinues to focus on the criminal investigation\u201d and had no further comment. The proposed settlement applies to a pending federal class-action lawsuit that involves a fraction of the overall accusers but is open to every woman who ever had an appointment with the gynecologist.

Attorney Gloria Allred, who represents 36 women who have accused Tyndall, said in a statement that the amount of money under the proposed settlement is \u201cway too minimal\u201d for what some of the women endured. Manly also criticized the proposed settlement as failing to hold USC accountable and called it an effort to cap future monetary damages. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know when did USC first know, how often were they warned, what administrators were involved, was there criminal conduct?\u201d Manly said. \u201cOur clients, more than anything, want those answers and people held accountable, not because it helps their case but to protect the future women at USC.\u201d Tara Lee, an attorney who represents USC, said questions regarding potential criminal conduct are being investigated \u201cand those answers will be available when the investigation itself is completed.\u201d \u201cThe settlement process they\u2019re criticizing would not provide for that,\u201d she said. \u201cThe settlement process would be very victim-focused to address their needs and make sure they have their claims identified and awarded.\u201d Under the proposal, any woman who had an appointment with Tyndall will get $2,500. Those who submit written claims detailing their allegations and the impact on their lives would be eligible for between $7,500 and $20,000. Women who agree to further detail their allegations in a private interview with a psychologist could see damages of up to $250,000. Lee said the school tried to create a system that would allow women to decide how much to engage in the process. Attorney Mike Arias, who represents 80 accusers, criticized the speed of the proposed settlement, saying he and other attorneys were expecting USC to disclose more information. \u201cUSC may quell the depth of the anger and upset by getting hundreds of other victims to join the settlement, but it\u2019s not going to be over,\u201d Arias said, adding that he and other attorneys will fight the settlement\u2019s approval.

And then we can actually replicate exactly the same, using 3D bioprinting technology to make a real functional organ,\u201d he said. \u201cTherefore, I believe we are much closer to a real human organ for the first time now.\u201d  Erturk\u2019s team plan to start by creating a bioprinted pancreas over the next 2-3 years and also hope to develop a kidney within 5-6 years.

REUTERS/Jason Reed The findings were published in the journal Lancet together with two other studies, which found that runny noses and wheezing early on in life may be strong predictors of asthma. In the first study, researchers pored through data provided by parents of more than 205,000 children and found paracetamol use in the first year of life was associated with a 46 percent higher risk of asthma by the time the children were 6 or 7 compared to those never exposed to the drug. Known as acetaminophen in the United States, where it is widely sold under the brand Tylenol, it is used to relieve fever, minor aches and pain, and is used in a liquid suspension for children. Medium use of paracetamol in the past 12 months increased asthma risk by 61 percent, while high dosages of once a month or more in the past year raised the risk by over three times. Medium use was defined as once per year or more, but less than once a month. Suspicions of a possible link between paracetamol and asthma emerged in recent years when experts observed an increased use of the drug to a simultaneous rise in asthma prevalence worldwide. One theory is that paracetamol reduces antioxidants in the body. Some experts think antioxidants, which stop unstable molecules known as free radicals from doing too much damage, can lower the risk of cancer, heart disease and other ailments. \u201cParacetamol can reduce antioxidant levels and ... that can give oxidative stress in the lungs and cause asthma,\u201d one of the researchers, Richard Beasley at the Medical Research Institute of New Zealand, told Reuters in a telephone interview. As with asthma, monthly use of paracetamol doubled the risk of eczema and trebled that of rhinoconjunctivitis \u2014 repetitive sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion and hay fever \u2014 by the time children were 6 or 7, the study found. However, the researchers stressed paracetamol should remain the preferred drug to relieve pain and fever in children because its alternative, aspirin, was linked to the risk of Reye\u2019s syndrome, a rare but serious complication in children. \u201cThe findings do lend support to the current guidelines of the World Health Organization, which recommend that paracetamol should not be used routinely, but should be reserved for children with a high fever (38.5 Celsius or above),\u201d they wrote. Another study in The Lancet found that rhinitis, or hay fever and other allergic reactions causing a runny nose, was a strong predictor of asthma that develops in adulthood. Researchers monitored 6,461 people in 14 countries who were free of asthma at the start of study for more than 8 years. Those who suffered rhinitis and were allergic to an assortment of agents like house dust mites, cat, grass and birch were 3.5 times more likely to develop asthma later on compared to those who suffered no allergies nor rhinitis. The third study in Arizona in the United States found wheezing early in life may be an ominous sign of asthma developing in adulthood. Researchers pored through data on 849 people going back 22 years to the time they were babies. Of 181 cases of active asthma, 49 were newly diagnosed, of which 35 were women. \u201cIn over 70 percent of people with current asthma and 63 percent of those with newly diagnosed asthma at age 22 years, episodes of wheezing had happened in the first three years of life or were reported by parents at age six years,\u201d wrote the researchers at the Arizona Respiratory Center.

It comes after 10 previously known cases of uterus transplants from deceased donors - in the United States, the Czech Republic and Turkey - failed to produce a live birth. The girl born in the Brazilian case was delivered via caesarean section at 35 weeks and three days, and weighed 2,550 grams (nearly 6 lbs), the case study said. Dani Ejzenberg, a doctor at Brazil\u2019s Sao Paulo University hospital who led the research, said the transplant - carried out in September 2016 when the recipient was 32 - shows the technique is feasible and could offer women with uterine infertility access to a larger pool of potential donors. The current norm for receiving a womb transplant is that the organ would come from a live family member willing to donate it. \u201cThe numbers of people willing and committed to donate organs upon their own deaths are far larger than those of live donors, offering a much wider potential donor population,\u201d Ejzenberg said in a statement about the results. She added, however, that the outcomes and effects of womb donations from live and deceased donors have yet to be compared, and said the technique could still be refined and optimized. The first baby born after a live donor womb transplant was in Sweden in 2013. Scientists have so far reported a total of 39 procedures of this kind, resulting in 11 live births. Experts estimate that infertility affects around 10 to 15 percent of couples of reproductive age worldwide. Of this group, around one in 500 women have uterine problems. Before uterus transplants became possible, the only options to have a child were adoption or surrogacy. In the Brazilian case, the recipient had been born without a uterus due to a condition called Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser syndrome. The donor was 45 and died of a stroke. Five months after the transplant, Ejzenberg\u2019s team wrote, the uterus showed no signs of rejection, ultrasound scans were normal, and the recipient was having regular menstruation. The woman\u2019s previously fertilized and frozen eggs were implanted after seven months and 10 days later she was confirmed pregnant.

Under the proposal, the distributors AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson would pay a total of $18 billion over 18 years. Johnson & Johnson would pay $4 billion over time. Drugmaker Teva would contribute the drugs, but not cash. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were ongoing and said the details of the deal could change. A $50 billion framework was first reported Wednesday by The New York Times. Samantha Fisher, a spokeswoman for the Tennessee attorney general\u2019s office, confirmed to the AP that that report \u201cappears to be correct on the details of the tentative settlement framework.\u201d It\u2019s not clear whether states and local governments will accept the deal. \u201cWe await the fine print of the settlement framework so that we can work alongside the 2,600 communities we represent to determine the best path forward,\u201d the lead lawyers for local governments said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cOur priority when assessing settlement proposals is to ensure they will provide urgently-needed relief in the near term and that these resources will be directed exclusively toward efforts to abate the opioid epidemic.\u201d The lawyers said the aim is \u201cto secure funds that will aid law enforcement officers, medical professionals, and treatment facility staff around the country for the decades-long recovery process ahead.\u201d Drug companies and other state attorneys general who are leading the talks either did not return messages or comment. The talks are picking up as a jury is being selected in Cleveland for a trial on claims against some companies in the drug industry being brought by the Ohio counties of Cuyahoga and Summit. They claim the companies engaged in a conspiracy that has damaged their communities should be held accountable. Jury selection began Wednesday and could wrap up Thursday, with opening arguments scheduled Monday. Johnson & Johnson has already settled with the two counties. If the other companies settle, too, it would leave only the pharmacy chain Walgreens \u2014 in its role as a distributor to its own stores \u2014 and the smaller distributor Henry Schein as defendants. It\u2019s not clear whether the trial would go on in that case. The defendants in the Cleveland trial include Actavis and Cephalon, drug companies now owned by Teva. All the companies say they complied with the law and supplied only drugs that doctors prescribed. While the case concerns only claims for the two counties, it is a bellwether intended to show how legal issues might be resolved in more than 2,000 other lawsuits over the opioid crisis. In court Wednesday, lawyers for the defendants argued that the trial should be postponed in case potential jurors saw any of the coverage and would be tainted when learning of the massive amount of money possibly being discussed. U.S. District Court Judge Dan Polster said he didn\u2019t believe many of the potential jurors would have been exposed to the stories but that he would question them to determine whether they were aware of the coverage. A delay, he said, could push the trial into next year. The other major question was how to select a dozen jurors for a trial over opioids in a region hit particularly hard by addictions and overdoses. Questionnaires were sent to potential jurors in nine northeast Ohio counties, including Cuyahoga, which along with neighboring Summit County was chosen as the first plaintiff in a trial in what could become the most complicated class action lawsuit in U.S. history. Cuyahoga County is home to Cleveland, and Summit to the city of Akron. The questionnaire asked potential jurors to answer questions about their and immediate family members\u2019 experiences with prescription painkillers and the crisis itself. They were asked to check off whether they had ever used 11 different prescription opioids. Had they or family members ever used heroin or illicit fentanyl? Have they ever been prescribed painkillers after surgery? Have they or a family member ever been treated for addiction? Have they ever overdosed? Those with close connections to the crisis are expected to be excluded from serving on the jury. Counting prescription drugs and illegal ones such as heroin and illicitly made fentanyl, opioids have been blamed for more than 400,000 deaths in the U.S. since 2000. ___ Mulvihill reported from Cherry Hill, New Jersey. ___ Associated Press writers Jonathan Mattise in Nashville, Tennessee, and Julie Carr Smyth in Columbus, Ohio, contributed to this report.", "output": "Opioid settlement talks broaden ahead of 1st federal trial.", "category": "Sentence Composition 486.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph, generate a claim that is supported by the given paragraph. 1) The claim must contain information from within the paragraph. 2) A sentence within the paragraph can be used as a claim. 3) The claim should not have contradictions within the paragraph. 4) The claim should be at most one sentence long.", "input": "Democratic state Sen.

The measure  would strengthen a state law that requires health insurance companies to cover mental health services in line with how they cover medical care. Holland and Baumgardner say people suffering from mental illness and their families have discovered that insurers can throw up obstacles to getting services, such as requiring prior approval or not authorizing coverage unless someone has attempted suicide first. The bill would rename the state\u2019s mental health coverage parity law after Kristi L.
