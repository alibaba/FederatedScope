We arrived on a Saturday morning with no appointment, so we assumed there would be a wait and we would need to be patient. The lady at the front took our name and said that we could browse around until someone called us or found us. \\n\\nAs we were looking around, we were searching for a dress for my mom to wear at the wedding. The staff was weaving in and out of us without even saying \\\"\"excuse me\\\"\" or \\\"\"I'm sorry\\\"\". When we found a dress that my mom liked that was on the sale rack, we asked if there was any way that we could order the dress in the size that we needed or call another store to purchase it from there and two staff members said \\\"\"no, we are not allowed to do that due to the dress being on sale\\\"\". So we just decided to wait around and about 20 minutes later, we were called to be measured. \\n\\nThis lady who helped us was the most rude person I have ever met. I did not get a great look at her name tag because she was barely ever with us, but it was something along the lines of Aona, etc. When she found us, all she said was \\\"\"who are you?\\\"\" when we told her were bridesmaids wanting to get measured, she said it was required to put the dress back on to be measured, no big deal. She gives me a head to toe look down (which I did not appreciate) and stated \\\"\"you're a size 14 or 16\\\"\". This was appalling to me. I am proudly a size 10 (in a David's Bridal dress) and did not think it was very professional for her to look me up and down and tell me what size I was. We had previously gone to the Vegas David's Bridal to pick out the bridesmaids dresses and the staff there asked me what size jeans I wear and explained that they would add a size or 2 up to find a good fit. She also gave my sister a dress size 8 sizes too small because it was \\\"\"required\\\"\" to put the dress on in order to measure us. \\n\\nSo we put our dresses on and she measures my sister who barely had the dress on because it was so small and looks at me and I tell her that the size 10 is perfect except that a little needed to be taken in right below my armpit about an inch. She looked at me and said \\\"\"Just buy a padded bra\\\"\" and I told her that I would never wear a padded bra that would cover a whole inch around me again. So she said \\\"\"then just get a strapless bra\\\"\" and I said I was going to but that a strapless bra would not hold my dress up by itself. She proceeds to leave us without taking my measurements at all and left me standing there wondering what she wanted me to do. My sister goes to ask her to take my measurements and she told me to take my dress off and for us to go to the front and someone else will do it. So I did and the lady in front took my measurements without my dress on; BUT WAIT. I thought it was \\\"\"required\\\"\" to have the dress on..\\n\\nWe finally got our measurements taken down and asked the lady to be sure that they were put into the computer so that my sister in Vegas could order our dresses from there a couple hours later because they were just going to be delivered to the Vegas store. We decided to look at shoes for a little bit and then leave. On the way out, we asked the lady at the front desk who were signed in with to check really quick if she could to make sure the measurements were put in. She said \\\"\"I'm pretty sure they're in there\\\"\" and she messed around on the computer and looks around and says \\\"\"I'll make sure they're in there soon\\\"\". So we leave.\\n\\nMy sister in Vegas then goes to her David's Bridal to order our dresses with the correct sizes and measurements and the staff there says that there are no measurements on her page. AND they tell us that the dress that my mother wanted to purchase that was on sale and not in her size could have been purchased over the phone at any David's Bridal in the country. We decided to call the Arizona (on Ray Rd) store back and let them know that the measurements were not in and that they lost a purchase and they came up with every excuse as to why the measurements were not in and gave us the most worthless apology for the dress my mother was interested in.\\n\\nI will never go to this David's Bridal again. I will gladly search elsewhere for another dress that I will need. The staff here are careless and rude.", "output": "NEGATIVE", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1102.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given Yelp reviews.

I'll point out that the culinary competition is rather low in the overstreet mall considering the only three restaurants next to Maddio's are Chick Fil A, Salsarita's and Just Fresh (all equally mediocre). \\\"\"How Do You Roll\\\"\" lasted a couple of months here, but its presence dissipated in a matter of days once people realized their \\\"\"sushi\\\"\" was 98% rice and ridiculously overpriced. On the other hand, Maddio's deserves to be in a class of its own because Fast Casual restaurants are hard to find around here (you pretty much just have Noodles & Co., Chipotle, Jason's Deli and Vappiano's... and that's like all Charlotte has to offer in this segment).\\n \\nMaddio's showcased item is of course, its pizza and I'll admit that I was pleasantly surprised. I'm a huge fan of thin crust pizza, and having just come back from Milan, I'm always searching (perhaps in vain) for that same delicious and savory crunch I experienced there. Nevertheless, my favorite part of a pizza is its tomato sauce and I really liked the version they have here. You can smell fresh garlic and perhaps some basil? It's also not too watery or dry. There are other sauces I have yet to try... I was eyeing the \\\"\"tomato bbq\\\"\". As far as pizza crusts go, this one is certainly acceptable. It's very crisp and holds its shape when you pick up a slice. I do like this pizza much better than Vappiano's which a bit more doughy and its tomato sauce tends to be over salted.\\n \\nDisclaimer: You can't expect pizza at a fast casual joint like this to be as good as a wood-fired pizza from your favorite Italian restaurant because, let's be real, you wouldn't be able to churn something like that out with the same efficiency that they have here. I only waited 5-6 minutes for my pizza to arrive steaming hot to my table (I tried the spicy Italian on traditional crust - you could also go for the wheat option). For what it is (a  $7 - $8 individual pizza), you'll find yourself eating every last slice. Toppings are varied and fairly good quality - you can even create your own pizza. I like that you can see your pizza being made through the glass window, so you know exactly what you're about to eat.\\n \\nThe salad we ordered paled in comparison to the pizza and some of the sandwich options I saw at people's tables, but that could just be because they stuck to a simple salad menu with generic dressings that every other restaurant has. I think I'll just stick to pizzas when I come here.\\n \\nThere are lots of options for everyone and if you have that \\\"\"I've tried one pizza, I've tried them all\\\"\" mentality, Uncle Maddio's just might make you rethink that philosophy.\\n \\n4/5", "output": "POSITIVE", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1102.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given Yelp reviews.
