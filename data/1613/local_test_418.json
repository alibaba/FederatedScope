A crab roll comes on a buttered & grilled roll so light it's almost ethereal. Really it's an amazing roll and just amplifies the quality of the crabmeat.

My husband and I have a joint card there, and she tells us that we should open separate ones so we get more percentage off coupons. Why would we want more than one credit card? The percentages off that we do get are more than adequate since we don't actually live in the Kohl's store like this woman apparently does. As I'm sure most other people do, we end up lying and saying we each have our own separate cards just to get her off our backs. We have made a game out of seeing if we can avoid being asked by her while we're there, but it's gotten to the point that even doing that it's still so irritating. I've decided that even though this is the closest location to us, I won't be shopping here anymore.", "output": "negative", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1374.json"}, {"instruction": "You are provided with a user review of a restaurant.

The flavor was great, and I definitely enjoyed it. The texture wasn't perfect, as there was a little bit of flavorless ice at the bottom, but not too big of a deal.

Your task is to classify the given review into two categories: 1) positive, and 2) negative based on its content.", "input": "We were very excited. We made it date night. We are both in the hospitality industry and were really rooting for this to be a great place. Our spidey senses went off almost immediately, though -- this was not going to be a great dining experience. Some of their failures are due to being new and can be fixed. The place was pretty empty, and the pointed choice by the owner (we asked) to not have any ambient music at all was disconcerting. Basically silence, punctuated by kitchen noise. I felt super sorry for the cooks, who apparently have to work in silence for their entire shifts, since otherwise thats all the guests would hear. Lose the attitude. Pipe in some sound, at least until business picks up.The ambiance left a little to be desired. Nothing special about it, relatively  uncomfortable tables lined up along the walls, some standard-issue 'New England fishing scheme' decor.But we were there for the food, so we tucked in. Service was OK. I didnt love the fact that, although admittedly my date was more outgoing than I was, the waiter addressed all of his remarks/conversation/etc. exclusively to him (Im female). And it didnt seem to be in a flirtatious way, more a completely-ignoring-that-I-existed way. A little weird. But, again: were here for the food. So....I love lobster, particularly lobster rolls, which any shitty bar in New England can do adequately for under $10 (or fantastically, if youre lucky). Ill certainly pay a premium since those little fellas have to be shipped across the country, but I did feel a little ridiculous eating $18 pub food. Nonetheless, we ordered a cup of each of the soups (Lobster Bisque and Salmon Chowder) to begin, and Lobster Newberg and a Lobster Roll entree to share.The bisque was very decent. Good smoked paprika flavor, nice, well-cooked chunks of lobster - not rubbery and overdone at all, but fresh, juicy, and succulent. It wasnt fantastic, but gave us real hope for the lobster to follow. The salmon chowder was utterly forgettable - seriously, Ive had more memorable from a food cart. Not bad - just not special, and up here in the northwest, you can get fantastic salmon chowder pretty much everywhere. The plating was problematic: we ordered cups, and were served large, full bowls. We could very well have been satisfied and left at that point, given the amount of soup. Not complaining, I suppose, but this isnt a good sign that they know what theyre doing. It looked bad as a presentation, and its wasteful on the food costs. (We didnt really have commentary on the much-debated rolls; they were fine.)I love the Northwest, but dammit, vegetables do not need to be added to every single dish... the addition of what appeared to be succotash to the lobster newberg was... surprising... and not in a good way. Whole peapods, baby carrots, and a ton of corn made this more 'lobster pot pie' than newberg. The sauce was gummy, and the puff pastry was stiff, overworked, and flavorless. The lobster itself was lovely - well-cooked and delicious. We picked it off of the dish and ate it alone.As for my lobster roll, I know there are two traditions, one erring more towards just butter as a binder, the other to mayonnaise, but completely dry lobster is a fail in both camps. The bun was fine (butter toasted hot-dog style bread), the lobster was tasty and well-cooked, but the whole thing was very dry. (I craved a Cambridge-bar roll, or at least some aioli on the side to baste this one with.) Served with forgettable shoestring fries and a meh coleslaw. With the bisque being 'good,' the salmon chowder being 'meh,' the newberg being 'downright awful,' and the roll being 'meh,' nothing about the silent and sterile ambiance being comfortable and inclining us to spend more time there/return/be romantic/eat more/etc., and the prices being relatively high, there is absolutely no chance we would return or recommend this place, particularly when you could go to dozens of better comparably-priced restaurants and have a marvelous dinner, presented beautifully, in a welcoming atmosphere.
