Personally, I don't understand what all the hoopla's about concerning HSM. Sure, the songs are not bad, and the actors are kinda cute, and you gotta give those guys credit for putting a lot of time and effort into this movie. But for some reason, this little teenybopper flick just doesn't turn me on like it seems to do with everyone else. Just about everywhere I turn, it's always \"High School Musical this\" and \"High School Musical that\", and all I can say is: \"Give me a break.\"\nquestion: Is there a good song in the movie?", "output": "the songs are not bad", "category": "Question Answering 573.json"}, {"instruction": "You will be given a review about a book, an item, a place or a movie.

A loud and welcoming staff. the service was really good. we got sat by the pass where the food was being made. The seating was quite tight but it was okay. Usually my favorite dish was the pork belly. The one at Guu was great! However, this one was really dry and was not what I anticipated. the other dishes such as the gyu carpaccio and tatakis where all nice as expected. It was a very busy night there and I enjoyed the cooks killing it in the kitchen.Having worked in a kitchen before, it reminded me of when I was younger. as I was walking out I was able to peak out on their patio.

While it is 2 blocks from Union Square, there is a trolley, street car and subway station literally outside of the door! There are also numerous shops and restaurants making it an ideal location. The hotel is newly renovated and we were very pleased with the cleanliness and spaciousness of the room. We also went to the hotel bar one of the nights and had a great time - service was great. We were able to get a great deal on Hotwire ($89 a night) - for that price, this hotel cannot be beat! I would recommend parking in another location, since they charge about $50 a night (we found a lot right down the street that was $25 a night).\nquestion: How good was your experience?", "output": "service was great", "category": "Question Answering 573.json"}, {"instruction": "You will be given a review about a book, an item, a place or a movie.

I focused on the words, \"Tiffany, nudity and adult situations.\" Fortunately the three did not meet. By the time Tiffany gets on the screen, the nudity is over and nothing to write home about. Like the Mega piranha, Tiffany has mutated and gotten huge, move over Sally Struthers. How big was she? She couldn't get raped in a Venezuelan prison. Likewise Paul Logan gives us his most unmemorable performance.The special effects were so bad, I was crying out for \"Mega Shark\". They had women on nuclear submarines with a control room that looked more like my living room, than an actual submarine control room. The Secretary of State describes the fish as traveling in \"groups\" (not schools). The fish absorb nutrients through the skin, yet jump on to land to eat people. In addition to battling various sizes of poorly generated computer fish, Tiffany and Logan must also battle rogue elements of the Venezuelan army.Unless you are into camp and have plenty of glaucoma medication, you might want to take a pass on this one.\nquestion: Was the 3-d effects of the movie nice o bad?", "output": "The special effects were so bad", "category": "Question Answering 573.json"}, {"instruction": "You will be given a review about a book, an item, a place or a movie.

Well seasoned, definitely would go again just for it. The waffles are good too, fluffy and warm, the combo is surely an acquired taste. I ordered Holy Cluck with sweet heat and hand cut wedges. The hand cut wedges are not so great. They are a bit shy of the size of an iPhone 7, only ate two to three. The staff is kind, the ambiance is very chill.
