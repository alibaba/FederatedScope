I am therefore used to spelling \"-ise\" as \"-ize\". I was a little surprised to find that \"enterprise\" is almost universally spelt with \"-ise\". Is there any particular reason that this is the case for this example, when \"-ize\" is so widely preferred in US English? \nAnswer: For one, because the etymology is different. -ise (-ize) is a causative suffix in formalise, realise etc. (to make something formal, to make something real...) But enterprise is not \"to make something enterpre\" or similar (whatever that might mean). The prise bit comes as a past participle of French prendre (to grasp, to take). Another answer is that enterprize is actually attested, and was apparently used more than enterprise in the second half of 18th century (N-gram viewer).", "output": "yes", "category": "Answerability Classification 854.json"}, {"instruction": "Given the Question and Answer pair, detect whether the answer is acceptable or not.

It doesn't need to be an existing word, feel free to create one of your own. It can also be made of words related to events and parties. (ex: club, event, guest list, etc.) Edit The word will serve as a new term to describ these people in a favorable way. It will probably be used for an app name so it need to be catchy and fun.

Is there any other kind of a gun than one used for shooting?! Why is it called \"shotgun\" instead of just a \"gun\" or a more technical term (9-gauge, barrel gun etc.)? \nAnswer: The \"shot\" in shotgun refers to the ammunition that the gun fires. Whereas a pistol or rifle fires bullets (single metal balls), a shotgun fires a shell packed with shot (hundreds of tiny metal balls).", "output": "yes", "category": "Answerability Classification 854.json"}, {"instruction": "Given the Question and Answer pair, detect whether the answer is acceptable or not.

As a English non-native speaker it is difficult for me to understand when I must use present perfect or past simple because in my official language there isn't the present perfect tense. I know that present perfect is related to something that happened in the past but its result is important now. But for instance: The message has been sent. The message was sent. Please help me point me out any examples/contexts where I should use 1. instead of 2. \nAnswer: Think of the past tense as referring to an event that took place at a particular time in the past. In saying The message was sent, the speaker will normally have in mind something like yesterday or last week. The present perfect is called 'present' for a reason. The speaker is talking about the situation now, a situation in which a past event has some bearing on the present. For example, The message has been sent might be followed by a comment such as so it's too late to do anything about it now.", "output": "no", "category": "Answerability Classification 854.json"}]
