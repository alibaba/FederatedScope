These shirt stays are easy to use. Clip it and forget it... There is no snagging on leg hair, no hurting your thumb pushing the little black thingy in like the old style, it stays in place, and keeps the shirt tuck in all day helping me to look slim and fit, even tho I may not be... lol.

This one however was a couple of bucks more, but you get what you pay for! Great instructions, powder spill block included made it WAY less messy and above all great quality. I had 100% success my first time.
