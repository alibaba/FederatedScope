In the process  it became the highest-grossing movie in US history  shattering the record comfortably held  for 20 years  by Star Wars. (George Lucas took out an ad in Variety where Han and Leia posed like Jack and Rose to publicly congratulate Cameron  perhaps with some sense of relief: Heavy is the head that wears the big-gross crown.) But Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worldwide theatrical gross was nearly $2.2 billion.

She had seen it 50 times so far and wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tired of it yet; the theater no longer charged her admission  and \u00e2\u0080\u0094 recognizing that the love of an adolescent girl is nothing to be trifled with \u00e2\u0080\u0094 saved her favorite seat for her every night. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJack is cuter than Leo \u00e2\u0080\u009d Gloria clarified  for anyone who wondered.", "output": "Neutral", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1049.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a sentence and an entity, the task is to select the authors sentiment towards the enity.

She and others clearly saw what was an opportunity. Before the war  women's colleges had taught women math and science but they were reluctant to train very many women because they knew they couldn't get jobs.

But I also thought Virginia Gildersleeve was very crafty. She and some of the other leaders did see this as a way to try to persuade MIT and Columbia and other places to open up some more slots in graduate school for women.

As  Chris Kennedy  campaigns for governor   he \u00e2\u0080\u0099s talked about  his  business successes.  He \u00e2\u0080\u0099s pointed to  his  management of the Merchandise Mart  \u00e2\u0080\u009cone of the great economic engines of Illinois \u00e2\u0080\u009d and to  his  role developing skyscrapers on Wolf Point along the Chicago River.  Kennedy   however  has not highlighted one of  his  biggest projects to date \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a nearly half-billion dollar public-private partnership to build a convention center and Medical Mart in Cleveland. Local politicians  led by a longtime family friend  gave  Kennedy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  company a no-bid contract and pushed through a controversial sales tax hike to pay for it. As the project got off the ground   Kennedy  told Cleveland residents the one-stop medical superstore would remake the Rust Belt city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s image into a \u00e2\u0080\u009cDisney World for doctors\u00e2\u0080\u009d and draw coveted medical conventions to town. Instead  the project was plagued by accusations of insider dealings  secrecy and failed promises.  Kennedy \u00e2\u0080\u0099s company made millions of dollars  while residents are stuck paying more on items they purchase. Four years after the 235 000-square-foot Medical Mart opened its doors   Kennedy  and  his  company have long since departed amid criticism they did little to foster the original goals of the struggling project. Now rebranded the Global Center for Health Innovation  the building sits eerily empty most days \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the glassy high-tech showrooms of its few tenants unstaffed and deserted. Subsequent management companies have failed to bring in revenue-producing tenants or the flood of health care trade shows once promised.  Kennedy  said  he  was only trying to help Cleveland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leaders achieve their goals of a new convention center and a revitalized downtown.  He  said  his  company took on a project when few were looking at the city  and the long-term business plan shifted after  he  left. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt certainly wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a secretive contract. It certainly wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t done without public scrutiny \u00e2\u0080\u009d  he  told the Chicago Tribune in a recent interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what generated more press coverage in Cleveland.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cHonestly  did we pull a fast one? Did we slide one by?\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Kennedy  added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think any of that happened. I think everybody knew everything by the time we completed our deal. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I believe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cuyahoga County\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current executive  Armond Budish  told reporters last month that he could call the Medical Mart building \u00e2\u0080\u009can inherited albatross \u00e2\u0080\u009d but chooses to remain hopeful the development someday will succeed. Tim Hagan  a  Kennedy  family friend  spearheaded the push for the Medical Mart when he was a county commissioner a decade ago. Hagan said he stands by his decision to support  Kennedy \u00e2\u0080\u0099s project but acknowledged the development has fallen short. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe point of what we were trying to do is make the convention facility \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 more attractive for outside investments to come in for events \u00e2\u0080\u009d Hagan said over coffee in a recent interview in Cleveland. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHas it worked out \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 as much as we thought it was going to work out  immediately? No  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Heywood Sanders is an urban planning and public policy scholar who is critical of convention centers as publicly funded economic development projects. He has studied the Medical Mart deal for years and said Cleveland was blinded by its own misplaced hopes and the  Kennedy  mystique. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDesperate cities do desperate things \u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sanders  a professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio. Sanders said no hard data existed showing that a Medical Mart would succeed or produce any economic benefits for Cleveland. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make sense then  and it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to make sense now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d David Heinzmann / Chicago Tribune Global Center for Health Innovation's glass and pre-fab concrete panel structure offers wide views of the Cleveland downtown mall and skyline from its atrium-style ground floor  shown on Oct. 10  2017. Global Center for Health Innovation's glass and pre-fab concrete panel structure offers wide views of the Cleveland downtown mall and skyline from its atrium-style ground floor  shown on Oct. 10  2017. (David Heinzmann / Chicago Tribune) Once a bustling industrial metropolis  Cleveland experienced a hard slide into Rust Belt decline during the 1970s and \u00e2\u0080\u009980s. Its population and manufacturing base shrank as factories and mills closed down. One of the bright spots in the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic landscape appeared to be health care. The Cleveland Clinic grew over the past 40 years to be one of the most renowned hospital complexes in the world \u00e2\u0080\u0094 rivaling the Mayo Clinic as a destination for affluent patients around the globe seeking out the best  most innovative care. The clinic campus sits several miles east of the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s downtown lakefront  which continued to decline over the years. Since the late \u00e2\u0080\u009970s  some civic leaders held onto the belief that renovating the outdated underground convention center might be the key to making the city center a destination once again. The political and financial capital to make it happen never materialized. Investing public money in building convention facilities is often a divisive issue. Boosters often say if you build it  they will come; others say the investment rarely pays off. William Bowen  a professor of public administration at Cleveland State University  puts himself in the latter category. Convention center deals typically underperform their projections that spurred their construction  he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMost of the time  the valuation of the impact of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s built either doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen  or \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t  as a rule  pay back the public coffers \u00e2\u0080\u009d Bowen said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s borne out by the majority of the research.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The hospital\u00e2\u0080\u0099s involvement started to change the sense of possibility  and then  Kennedy \u00e2\u0080\u0099s involvement would put it over the hump  Hagan said. The consensus version of how the development came about begins with Dr. Toby Cosgrove  Cleveland Clinic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s longtime president. According to  Kennedy   Cosgrove wanted to leverage the clinic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cachet to revitalize downtown Cleveland. Cosgrove declined multiple interview requests.  Kennedy  said a New York real estate executive who was Cosgrove\u00e2\u0080\u0099s patient recommended Merchandise Mart and  Kennedy .  Kennedy  said Cosgrove called  him  to discuss the potential for a mart geared toward medical professionals.  Kennedy  said in 2005  he  and another Merchandise Mart official met with Cosgrove and local and state economic officials at the clinic.  Kennedy  said  he  suggested the new medical mart be tied into rebuilding Cleveland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aging convention center.", "output": "Negative", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1049.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a sentence and an entity, the task is to select the authors sentiment towards the enity.

Cameron  had always loved diving and deep-sea exploration  and The Abyss   his  third film as director and sole writer  had been a love letter to both. But that was fantasy; Titanic was real. And when  Cameron  first decided to pursue the project  the prospect of going to the wreck of Titanic might have been incentive enough to pitch the movie. When  he  first met with 20th Century Fox Chairman Peter Chernin to discuss Titanic  in the spring of 1995   he  asked for $2 million to fund a deep-sea expedition. It was an amazing sum of money to the Russian scientists and submersible pilots who took  Cameron  to the wreck. It was nothing compared to Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s final price tag. When Titanic opened in theaters across the US  on the weekend of Dec. 19  1997  it became the No. 1 movie in America by the skin of its teeth  edging out the latest James Bond movie  Tomorrow Never Dies  by a margin of $3.5 million. But to the executives who had nervously overseen Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s production \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and watched its budget nearly double  from $110 to $200 million \u00e2\u0080\u0094 this wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t particularly encouraging news. For Titanic to earn a profit  executives calculated  it would have to attract viewers in utterly unprecedented numbers: Even if it sold more tickets than Dances With Wolves  the most profitable three-hour-long movie ever released  Fox would still be $70 million in the red. And to be a success? It would have to somehow repeat its $28 million opening-weekend ticket sales \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and stay the No. 1 movie in America \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for weeks and weeks in a row  in a way no movie had in nearly a decade. It would have to be more than just a movie. It would have to become a cultural obsession. And it did.  Cameron  had once \u00e2\u0080\u0094 optimistically  as the final budget reflected \u00e2\u0080\u0094 called Titanic \"a $190 million chick flick.\" By Jan. 31  1998  20th Century Fox estimated that 7% of all American teenage girls had seen the movie twice. They weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the only ones going back to see Titanic a second time  and perhaps a third  though they did receive the most press. In 1997  the average return viewer rate for a theatrically released movie was 2%. Meanwhile  Titanic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s was 20%. In February 1998  a survey found that 76% of Titanic's repeat viewers still planned to see it again. It made more money \u00e2\u0080\u0094 $32 million \u00e2\u0080\u0094 during its 11th weekend in theaters than it did during its first. (It helped that this weekend also happened to fall on Valentine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Day.) Theaters that previously worried about losing money on a movie they could screen only two or three times a day started squeezing in showings as early as 8 a.m. and as late as midnight  letting out satisfied viewers at 3:30 in the morning. Adults  people with families  responsibilities  and jobs  flocked to see Titanic. Because for a little while \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for 3 hours and 14 minutes  to be precise \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the rest of their lives disappeared. Titanic gave people a way to make the rest of their lives disappear  and so they kept coming back  and finding that the world  James Cameron  had created for them still felt just as real as it had the first time. What made Titanic not just a movie  but a destination? And what did it take to will such a world into solid reality?", "output": "Neutral", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1049.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a sentence and an entity, the task is to select the authors sentiment towards the enity.

During Wright\u2019s interrogation  which was recounted at trial in testimony by a local police officer  he claimed that  Hoxha  reached out to him via Paltalk and asked him if he was interested in Islamic State. Wright told the officer that he responded three weeks later after conducting research  telling  Hoxha  that  he  believed that Islamic State\u2019s\u2019 mission was legitimate and necessary. From this point on  Hoxha and Wright were in frequent contact via Paltalk and Skype\u2019s instant messenger service  sharing videos  issues of Islamic State\u2019s official magazine Dabiq  and news articles about the group and its activities. These conversations between Wright and  Hoxha  continued until April 2015  when  Hoxha  left the U.S. to join Islamic State. Among the subjects of most interest were the best options for joining and what would ensure the maximum religious reward. Some early Western travelers believed that they could migrate to Islamic State-held territory (an act that the group refers to as hijrah)  but only participate in the societal aspects of the self-declared Caliphate while avoiding combat and violence. Neither Wright nor  Hoxha  appear to have held that na\u00efve delusion. According to trial exhibits of their conversations  Wright cautioned  Hoxha  that \u201cif you want to travel and live under a dawla [Islamic state] there is no harm in that  but you won\u2019t receive the reward from Allah like those who are assembled in the ranks unless you assemble in the ranks.\u201d", "output": "Positive", "category": "Sentiment Analysis 1049.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a sentence and an entity, the task is to select the authors sentiment towards the enity.
