Taking advantage of gaming laws that allow him to work in a casino while his gaming licence is pending, Sam doubles the casino's profits, which are skimmed by the mafia before they are reported to income tax agencies. Impressed with his work, mafia boss Remo Gaggi (Pasquale Cajano), sends Sam's childhood friend and mob enforcer Nicholas \"Nicky\" Santoro (Joe Pesci) and his associate Frank \"Frankie\" Marino (Frank Vincent) to protect Sam and the whole operation. Nicky's volatile temper soon gets him banned from every casino in Las Vegas, so he gathers his own crew and engages in independent shakedowns and burglaries instead.Sam meets and falls in love with a hustler and former prostitute, Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone). They conceive a daughter and marry, but their marriage is proven difficult by Ginger's strong independence and love for her former boyfriend, con artist-turned pimp Lester Diamond (James Woods), who is ordered beaten severely by Sam and Nicky after they catch him conning Ginger out of some money. Ginger subsequently turns to alcohol. Meanwhile, Sam makes an enemy in county commissioner Pat Webb (L. Q. Jones) for firing his brother-in-law Don Ward (John Bloom) for incompetence. When Sam refuses to reinstate him, Webb pulls Sam's licence from the backlog, forcing him to face a hearing for his gaming licence while secretly arranging for the board to deny Sam. Sam blames the incident on Nicky's recklessness and the two argue furiously in the desert after Sam attempts to tell Nicky to leave Las Vegas.The casino counters begin stealing some money for themselves, prompting the Midwest mafia bosses to put Artie Piscano (Vinny Vella) of the Kansas City mafia in charge of overseeing the transactions. Piscano is hopelessly inept. Incapable of finding the thieves, he instead keeps tabs of everything he knows about Vegas in a private notebook, and rants about it in his grocery store, unaware that the FBI have bugged the store as part of investigations completely unrelated to Vegas. Piscano's detailed complaints - complete with names - spurs the FBI to begin investigating the casino. Meanwhile, Sam finally seeks divorce from Ginger, tired of her alcoholism. She then kidnaps their daughter, Amy, taking her to Los Angeles, and plans to flee to Europe with Lester. Sam convinces her to come back with Amy, and then scolds her for stealing his money and kidnapping their daughter. After he overhears Ginger talking on the phone about killing him, he kicks her out of the house, but soon relents knowing if he gives Ginger money he would never see her again. Ginger then approaches Nicky for help in getting her valuables from their shared vault in the bank, and the two start an affair. Sam discovers this after finding Amy tied to her bed by Ginger, who is with Nicky at his restaurant. Sam disowns Ginger, and so does Nicky. A furious and drunk Ginger crashes her car into Sam's driveway, making a scene and retrieves the key to their deposit box after distracting the attending police. Though she succeeds in taking her share of the money from the bank, she is arrested by the FBI for aiding and abetting Sam.The FBI move in and close the casino. Green decides to cooperate with the authorities. Piscano dies of a heart attack upon seeing federal agents discover his notebook. Nicky flees Las Vegas before he can be caught. The FBI approach Sam for help, but he turns them down. The aging bosses are arrested and put on trial, but decide to eliminate anyone involved in the scheme to stop them from testifying and prolonging their coming sentences, among them three casino executives, Teamsters head Andy Stone (Alan King) and money courier John Nance. Ginger flees to Los Angeles and ultimately dies penniless of a drug overdose in a motel. Sam himself is almost killed in a car bomb, and suspects Nicky was behind it. Before Sam can take revenge, Nicky and his brother Dominick are ambushed by Frankie and their own crew and savagely beaten and buried alive in a cornfield, the bosses having had enough of Nicky's behaviour and offering his crew clemency in exchange for the murder (the bosses also suspected Nicky's role in Sam's car bombing.)With the mob now out of power, the old casinos are demolished and purchased by big corporations, who build new and gaudier attractions, which Sam laments are not the same as when the mafia was in control. Sam subsequently retires to San Diego and continues to live as a sports handicapper for the mob, in his own words, ending up \"right back where I started\". He closes the film with the words, \"and that's that\".", "output": "How does Piscano dies?", "category": "Question Generation 821.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Martin is unsure of Ripley, but Ripley's goddaughter (Ripleys ex-partners daughter), Alexandra Korolenko (Radha Mitchell) convinces him other wise. Ripley doesn't like that the two are getting close. Ripley tells Martin the plan, that they are going to steal from a Russian Museum that has been smuggling Russian treasures into the country and bribing the NYPD with large donation and expensive equipment. The two infiltrate a party at the museum posing as cops to gather information about their vault.The Russian mob, led by Nicky (Rade Serbedzija), grow impatient with Ripley and kidnap Alexandra.

It is then revealed that Ripley had escaped, letting the museum know cops were on the way and that they had cleaned out the vault of all the smuggled items (which had included the eggs) before the police could inspect it, meaning there was no evidence that anything had been stolen and that Martin's testimony would be worthless as his actions have been kept off the book to prevent Ripley from finding out and that Martin's involvement with Alex compromises him, and Ripley had to be let go.Ripley later calls Martin from a tarmac ready to leave with Victor to meet with a buyer for the eggs, letting him know that they knew Martin was a cop from the beginning, and that they plan on going into hiding, although Alex will continue to stay in New York (having been in on the plan the whole time) and where he can pick up his cut.

In order to excavate a new shaft quickly, he employs a dynamite charge, but the explosion causes the mine to collapse, burying a large group of the children alive. Following his later trial for wilfully causing the death of his workers, Carlton is acquitted and the mine closed down.In present day, eighty years later, Karen Tunny has just lost her husband after a long period of terminal disease and has inherited his birthhome near the since-abandoned Carlton mine. She moves to the house with her daughters, Sarah and Emma. The three stop by the local market for supplies and are told by Walter, the shopkeeper, that he doesn't deliver to the area they live in. While driving, Karen has a near miss with a man crossing the road. She exits the car, looking for the man, but he's nowhere to be found. They arrive at the house and Sarah points out the blood on the door while Karen declares it's just \"paint.\"When Emma hears children giggling, she leaves the house, following the sound of it. Karen goes out looking for Emma and finds her in an old mine. As they try to find their way back to the house, it becomes nightfall and they get lost. They find a house, which is occupied by Hanks, and enter. Karen is advised by Hanks to stay at home during the night, and he also tells her that there is no need to thank him for the blood smeared on his and the Tunny's door.William Carlton, the last surviving heir of the Carlton estate, which has owned the mine since 1913, is hungrily devouring property and kicking people off his own property. Meanwhile, the zombie children begin to kill, which is dismissed among the community as disappearances, though it is hinted that most of the community is aware of the presence of the children.As it turns out, the Tunny and Hanks families are relatives of the zombie children who happen to leave blood relatives alive while killing all others. Emma, who has had friendly contact with a less-violent zombie named Mary, informs her mother that the zombies won't eat her, and that Mary would not directly hurt her mother (who is not a direct Tunny blood relative), but passes on the warning that the other children might. Karen finds some old family photo albums in the basement that contain pictures of her late husband, as well as the Tunny and Hanks children who died in the mine disaster, thus revealing that the family is related to some of the children who had died.Karen and Sarah leave the house to go look for Emma. As they exit the mine, not being able to find Emma, they become surrounded by a dozen of the children. They escape, with the children pursuing them, and find a car passing through with Carlton inside. They enter, telling him to drive, but the tires are slashed before they can pull away.Karen and Sarah run to Hanks' house, unsure of what to do. Soon enough, Karen figures out that Hanks' blood has a supposed repellent effect on the zombie children. As both Hanks and Carlton attempt to shoot the children, they realize the bullets are ineffective, and run to the barn.Hanks realizes that, as he and Emma are direct blood relatives, it turns out Mary has an older brother that's also a Tunny, and Karen is in some way protected by Emma's relationship with Mary. The children are really after Carlton, as they blame his family for the mining accident that killed them.After Carlton is killed by the children, Emma remarks that they won't be hurting anyone anymore.At the end, the Tunny family drives away and reveals that the house has not been sold.

And we are left with the ultimate conclusion that where true love is concerned at least, the answer is a resounding \"Yes\" to a Grand Design.An easy-going garage mechanic, Ed Walters (Tim Robbins), meets Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan), a successful Princeton University mathematics doctoral candidate, as she comes into the garage, accompanied by her resistant and critical English fianc\u00c3\u00a9, acerbic experimental psychology professor James Moreland (Stephen Fry). There is an immediate \"electric\" connection which Ed recognizes, but she is not yet aware.Ed sees his future, briefly, and Catherine is a major part of it; they are married, and have children together. \"How long will all of this take?\" asks Catherine, referring to the car repair, and Ed, thinking about their future life together, replies, \"That's up to you\". His life purpose has suddenly been decided by a force of nature greater than himself.Finding a watch she left at the garage, Ed travels to her address and finds himself face to face with Albert Einstein (Walter Matthau), who is Catherine's uncle.[1]Albert\u00e2\u0080\u0094portrayed as a fun-loving genius\u00e2\u0080\u0094and his mischievous friends, fellow scientists Nathan Liebknecht (Joseph Maher), Kurt G\u00c3\u00b6del (Lou Jacobi), and Boris Podolsky (Gene Saks), see Ed as someone who would be better suited for Catherine. The four of them try to help Ed look and sound like a scientist (i.e., a \"wunderkind\" in physics) temporarily, in order to garner Catherine's attention for Ed, while at the same time trying to convince Catherine that life is not all about the mind, but is also about the heart. James's heart is virtually non-existent, while Ed's heart is virtually limitless.Einstein sees bringing Ed and Catherine together as his most enduring legacy to his niece, because she was of the mistaken opinion that her only contribution to the world was to be through her children, and that she therefore must marry a total intellectual because then she will produce genius children, like himself. Einstein realizes that Ed loves Catherine for herself, and will help her blossom into her full potential as a person full of life and spirit; a fellow world traveler with mutual interests as varied as the Boyd's Comet and the Seven Sacred Pools on Maui, which James belittled.Catherine eventually sees through the \"intellectual Ed\" ruse Einstein and his cohorts had temporarily created in order to get her to give Ed some attention, and falls for Ed anyway, just as Einstein had hoped. A smiling Albert Einstein uses a small telescope to spy happily on the two young moonstruck lovers as they take delight in the return of Boyd's Comet and in each other's company.

A banner hangs off his back. \"Ogami: Suiouryo technique\" (Child and expertise for rent), it says. His services are asked for in a most unexpected way, when an insane woman seizes Daigoro from the cart and proceeds to try and breastfeed the boy. Daigoro at first hesitates, but after stern look from his father, he proceeds to suckle the crazy woman's breast. The woman's mother then apologizes for her daughter's behavior and tries to give Itto money, but the stoic ronin refuses, saying his son was hungry anyway.As he walks in the rain, he remembers another rainy day several months earlier when his wife, Asami, was slain by three ninjas, ostensibly in revenge for Itto's execution of a boy daimyo in the opening scene, but it was really part of a complicated plot by the shogun's Inspector Bizen and the \"Shadow\" shogun of the Yagyu Clan to frame Itto for treason and take over the executioner's post. Itto takes on Bizen and his men killing them all.Now a wandering assassin for hire, Itto takes a job from a local chamberlain, to kill a rival and his gang of henchmen, who pose a threat to the chamberlain's lord. The chamberlain plans to test Itto, but a quick slash behind his back with his Dotanuki sword dispatches the chamberlain's two men. The targets are in a remote mountain village that is home to hot-spring spa pools.As Itto pushes the baby cart, and Daigoro observes scenes of nature, such as a mother dog suckling one puppy, and two children singing a song and bouncing a ball, Itto thinks back again to the time just after his wife was killed. He gave Daigoro a choice between a toy ball or the sword. If the child chose the ball, Itto would put him to death send him to be with his mother (a better place in his opinion). But the curious child reaches for the sword; he has chosen to take the path of the ronin with his father, to live like demons at the crossroads to hell.Flashing forward to the present, Itto reaches the hot-spring village. He finds that the rival chamberlain and his men have hired a band of ronins who have taken over the town and are raping, looting and pillaging. Itto is forced to give up his sword and take his place as a hostage in the village.The ronins discuss killing Itto, but then decide to let him live if he will have sex with the town's remaining prostitute while they watch. The prostitute refuses to have any part in it, but then she's threatened by one of the men, a knife-throwing expert, and in order to save the woman, Itto steps forward and disrobes, saying he will do the men's bidding with the woman.In yet another flashback it shows the dramatic beheading and blood-spurting scene in which Itto defeats one of Yagyu Retsudo's best swordsman, with the aid of a mirror on Daigoro's forehead to reflect the sun into the swordsman's eyes.And then there is the big showdown in the village, where it is revealed that the baby cart harbors some secrets various edged weapons, including a spear-like naginata, which Itto uses to take out the evil chamberlain's men, chopping one off at his ankles, leaving the bloody stumps of his feet still standing on the ground.One of the men has matchlock pistols, but Itto quickly upturns the baby cart, which is revealed to be armored underneath, and when the gunman's pistols are empty, Itto quickly leaps over the baby cart and brings his blade down on the man's forehead, splitting it two.After all the enemy ronin are dead, Itto leaves the village, and the prostitute hopes to follow, but Itto makes a motion to cut the ropes on the bridge leading to town, to stop her from following, for the journey he is on is one that is for only him and Daigoro to make.", "output": "What is Ogami Itto's other name?", "category": "Question Generation 821.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

He explains that he \"goes back there every night\" right before he wakes up in bed with his wife in their squalid NYC apartment. The distorted cries of his baby are heard, and his very pregnant wife wakes up to tend to their six-month-old son. They argue over Frankie's unemployment and their son's health. The baby is a mutant. Frankie assumes it was a result of chemical weapons, such as Agent Ornage, used during the war.Frankie then goes out onto the urban jungle of the streets. He passes by a junkie who buys some drugs from the local kingpin, Paco. The junkie desperately searches for a needle to shoot up with.Frankie waits in line outside the unemployment office. But after a while, Frankie's social worker tells him that there is no work for him at the current time. Typical of the movie, unexplained arbitrary things happen, such as the social worker asking another if he's seen his Veg-O-Matic. Frankie's social worker spaces out during their meeting and says, \"Life is hot, and because life is hot, I must take off my jacket.\" He then resumes the meeting, imploring Frankie to go back to school because he has no marketable skills. Frankie claims that he has no money or funds for college and is desperate for work, having been unemployed for four months.Back on the streets, Frankie kills time entertaining a child prostitute. But when he tells the prositute that he has no money, she tells him to go away. After Frankie leaves, Paco, the child prostitue's pimp, beats up the teenage girl for not making enough money.Meanwhile, the junkie resorts to dumping the drugs directly onto a wound he opens in his arm with a rusted coat hanger wire and passes out. A random woman comes upon him and steals his gun and ammunition, putting them in her purse.Frankie calls his father from a local payphone to ask for money. His father thinks the call is a prank, because he believes his son died in Saigon 15 years ago. Frankie explains that he was reported killed in action, but he made it out alive and spent three years in a U.S. Army hospital recuperating. Frankie tells his father that his wife is pregnant again and they are being evicted within a few days from their apartment, but his father says that he is also broke and about to die from cancer.Seemingly broken, Frankie comes across the same woman who stole the junkie's gun and steals her purse, an out of character criminal act for him. She screams for help. Paco and his thugs chase Frankie. When they overcome him, they mercilessly beat him up. The gun falls out of the bag during the pummeling. When Paco goes through the bag, he finds the bullets and realizes there must have been a gun in it. He turns around to see Frankie standing with the gun. Frankie shoots and kills all three men in a daze.With Frankie beaten to a pulp, his voice-over explains that his father was right: he had died in Saigon. He explains in another flashback to Vietnam that his company had come upon a village where everyone had killed themselves to avoid being raped and murdered by the US soldiers. Frankie went AWOL and spent days wondering aimlessly in the jungle. He realizes that he must similarly 'save' his family, and he returns home.That evening, Frankie returns home where his wife is horrified by his appearance and briefly tends to his wounds.

Frankie walks into the bedroom, tells his pregnant wife that he loves her, and then shoots her in the stomach. As she lies on the ground, he shoots her three more times, yelling at her to die. He shoots the deformed baby and then picks it up from the crib. He cradles it and walks into the kitchen with it. Frankie lays the baby in the oven, and turns it all the way to the cleaning setting.

A police cryptographer and Sauni\u00c3\u00a8re\u00e2\u0080\u0099s granddaughter, Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), reveals to Langdon that Fache planted a tracker on him, believing he murdered Sauni\u00c3\u00a8re due to a message to find him, erased by Fache.

Evading the police, Langdon and Sophie travel to the Depository Bank of Zurich, discovering a safety deposit box opened by the Fibonacci sequence. Inside is a cryptex: a cylindrical container that hides a papyrus message which can only be accessed by spelling out a five-letter code word using dials. When the police arrive, Langdon and Sophie are aided by the bank manager Andre Vernet (J\u00c3\u00bcrgen Prochnow), only for him to take them hostage in the back of a truck, demanding the cryptex.

The Opus Dei have been trying to destroy the Grail to preserve the credibility of the Vatican. Silas breaks in, but Teabing knocks him out. The group escape to London via Teabing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s private plane, aided by his butler Remy Jean (Jean-Yves Berteloot). They travel to the Temple Church but the clue to unlocking the cryptex is a red herring. Silas is freed by Remy, who claims to be the Teacher, taking Teabing hostage and dumping him in his car\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trunk while Silas hides out in an Opus Dei safe house. Teabing poisons Remy and send the police after Silas, who is shot by police after accidentally wounding Aringarosa, who is promptly arrested by Fache for using him to hunt Langdon.Langdon and Sophie are confronted by Teabing, revealed to be the Teacher, who wants to bring down the Church for centuries of persecution and deceit. The trio goes to Westminster Abbey to the tomb of Isaac Newton, a former grand master of the Priory. Langdon tosses the cryptex into the air, Teabing catching it but the papyrus is destroyed.

Zira reminds Simba of how he exiled her and the other Outsiders, and she reveals that she selected Kovu to be Scar's successor.After returning to the Pride Lands, Simba sends Nala and the rest of the pride back to Pride Rock while he lectures Kiara about the danger posed by the Outsiders. Simba then tells her that they are a part of each other. Meanwhile in the Outlands, Zira reminds Kovu that Simba killed Scar and exiled the lions who respect him. Kovu explains that he does not think it is so bad to have Kiara as his good friend, but Zira realizes she can use Kovu's friendship with Kiara to seek revenge on Simba.Several years later, Kiara begins her first solo hunt, but Simba has Timon and Pumbaa follow her in secret, causing her to hunt away from the Pride Lands. As part of Zira's plan, Kovu's siblings Nuka and Vitani trap Kiara in a fire, allowing Kovu to rescue her. Unable to thank the young rogue, Simba is forced to accept Kovu's asylum since Kovu rescued Kiara. Later that night, Simba has a nightmare about attempting to save Mufasa from falling into the stampede but is stopped by Scar who then morphs into Kovu and throws Simba off the cliff to his death.The next day, Kovu contemplates attacking Simba as he was instructed to, but he teaches Kiara how to hunt instead and eventually realizes his feelings for her. Later, Kiara and Kovu stargaze where they talk about the Great Kings of the Past and Kovu wonders if there is a darkness in him like there was in Scar. Simba watches the two from afar and Nala convinces him to give Kovu a chance. Kovu attempts to reveal his mission to Kiara, but Rafiki interrupts and leads them to the jungle, where he introduces them to \"upendi\", which means love in Swahili. The two lions fall in love. That night, Simba allows Kovu to sleep inside Pride Rock with the rest of the pride, but Vitani tells Zira about Kovu's failure to kill Simba.The next day, Kovu wants to reveal his mission to Kiara, but Simba takes him around the Pride Lands and tells him the real story of Scar. They fall into Zira's trap and the Outsiders attack Simba. Kovu attempts to intervene, but Vitani injures him. Nuka attempts to kill Simba, but Simba flees and Nuka is killed. Zira scratches Kovu for his brother's death, causing him to turn on her. Kovu attempts to plead Simba for his forgiveness, but is exiled. Kiara makes Simba realize that he is acting irrationally, and flees to find Kovu. The two lions later find each other and profess their love. Kovu wants to start a pride of his own with Kiara, but she tells him to return to the Pride Lands and reunite their prides.The Outsiders and Pridelanders fight, but Kovu and Kiara intervene and tell Zira and Simba to stop fighting. Vitani and the Outsiders side with the Pridelanders. Zira attempts to kill Simba, but Kiara pushes her over a cliff, dangling over a storm-swollen river. Kiara offers her help, but Zira refuses and falls to her death. Rescuing Kiara, Simba reconciles with the Outsiders and Kovu, allowing them to rejoin the Pride Lands. Simba accepts Kovu as his son-in-law and the future king and Kiara the future queen.

Despite receiving a $2,000 scholarship from the local Moose lodge, Curt is undecided if he wants to leave the next morning with Steve to go to the northeastern United States to begin college. Steve lets Toad borrow his 1958 Chevrolet Impala for the evening and while he's away at college until Christmas.

En route to the dance, at a stoplight, Curt sees a beautiful blonde girl in a white 1956 Ford Thunderbird. She appears to say \"I love you\" before disappearing around the corner. After leaving the hop, Curt is desperate to find the mysterious blonde, but is coerced by a group of greasers (\"The Pharaohs\") to participate in an initiation rite that involves hooking a chain to a police car and ripping out its back axle. Curt is told rumors that \"The Blonde\" is either a trophy wife or prostitute, which he refuses to believe.Following a series of arguments, Steve and Laurie split, and John inadvertently picks up Carol, an annoying teenybopper who seems fond of him. Toad, who is normally socially inept with girls, successfully picks up a flirtatious, and somewhat rebellious, girl named Debbie. Meanwhile, Curt learns that the DJ Wolfman Jack broadcasts from just outside Modesto. Inside the radio station, Curt encounters a bearded man he assumes to be the manager. Curt hands the man a message for \"The Blonde\" to call or meet him. As he walks away, Curt hears the voice of The Wolfman, and, having just seen The Wolfman broadcasting, he realizes he had been speaking with The Wolfman himself.The other story lines intertwine until Toad and Steve end up on \"Paradise Road\" to watch John race his yellow deuce coupe against the handsome, but arrogant, Bob Falfa. Earlier, Bob had picked up Laurie, who is now sitting shotgun in his black '55 Chevy. Within seconds of the finish, Bob loses control of his car after blowing a front tire, plunges into a ditch and rolls his car. Steve and John run to the wreck, and a dazed Bob and Laurie stagger out of the car before it explodes. Distraught, Laurie grips Steve tightly and tells him not to leave her. He assures her that he has decided not to leave Modesto after all. The next morning Curt is awakened by the sound of a phone ringing in a telephone booth, which turns out to be \"The Blonde\". She tells him she might see him cruising tonight, but Curt replies that is not possible, because he will be leaving. At the airfield he says goodbye to his parents, his sister, and friends.

The apparent single exception is a box canyon, surrounded by lead-bearing cliffs, in which former Navy Commander Jim Maddison lives with daughter Louise (Lori Nelson) in a home stocked with supplies anticipating just such a holocaust. Louise is engaged to be married, but her fiance is missing.Into this natural bomb shelter come stumbling survivors, who by chance were inside the canyon when the war occurred. After initially refusing to admit them, Jim relents when his daughter appeals to his humanity. Among the survivors are a geologist, Rick (Richard Denning), who happens to specialize in uranium mining, and a small-time hood, Tony (Mike Connors, billed as \"Touch\" Connors), with his \"moll\" Ruby (Adele Jergens), on their way to San Francisco.There are two struggles for survival: the first is a simple question of whether the radioactive fallout will dissipate, and if so, before the rain comes to wash what's in the atmosphere down to Earth, contaminating the shelter. The second threat comes in the form of a giant, hideous monster, which seems bent on killing anything it comes across, but only eating those creatures contaminated by fallout.A less obvious, but no less dangerous, threat is the hidden menace of Tony; although seemingly charming and helpful, his true character and intentions are that he wants the other men out of the way, so that he can have the two women to himself.All three dangers coincide as the monster kidnaps Louise. It then releases her into a small lake, where he is obviously afraid to enter. Rick appears and attacks the creature, which runs away as it begins to rain. Following the creature destroyed by the rain, they realize that it is Louise's missing fiance. Tony, having stabbed Ruby to death when she realizes that he wants to be with the younger Louise, then steals Jim's pistol. He waits to waylay Rick when he returns with Louise.

Originally under the impression the crime was a simple robbery-gone-wrong, the brothers soon discover that the robbery was merely a cover for what was, in fact, a hit put out on Evelyn. After this revelation, Bobby (Mark Wahlberg), Angel (Tyrese Gibson), Jeremiah (Andr\u00c3\u00a9 3000) and Jack Mercer (Garrett Hedlund) track down the hired guns who killed Evelyn. Refusing to say anything, they are unceremoniously executed by Bobby and Angel.The next day, Detroit Police Lieutenant Green (Terrence Howard) and Detective Fowler (Josh Charles) confront the brothers about the murders. Lieutenant Green warns them that their interference with Evelyn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case is ill-advised, and that it will eventually put them in over their heads. After confronting Jeremiah about the revelation of his failing business and benefiting from Evelyn's life insurance, the brothers are treated to a somewhat different version of events. Jeremiah informs them that his construction company was failing precisely because he was not getting involved with Victor Sweet (Chiwetel Ejiofor), and that for a project to succeed he had to pay off the right people, which he initially failed to do. In his effort to restore his business and relieve pressure from himself, he tried to pay off Sweet's henchmen. As for the life insurance, Jeremiah explains that the money went directly to him for his daughters, because he paid all of Evelyn's bills while his other brothers were not around.Back at their home, during a confrontation with Jeremiah, Sweet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s men attack the brothers. Jack is shot and killed during the attack. Bobby finds one of the gunmen still alive and questions him about who sent them. He almost spares the gunman but is offended when the gunman mumbles \"Thank God\" and kills him anyway. When Lieutenant Green arrives, he tells them not to worry about any legal ramifications, assuring them that it will go down as self-defense. He also informs them that Evelyn filed a police report regarding Victor Sweet and his involvement in Jeremiah's affairs, and his partner, Detective Fowler, passed on that report to Sweet. Green warns the brothers to stay out of the matter and let him handle Fowler and then they will work together on Sweet. Later at a bar Green confronts Fowler, hitting him and ordering Fowler to hand in his badge. They walk out of the bar, and Fowler kills Green and calls it into dispatch claiming two assailants had fired upon Green.Meanwhile, the remaining brothers devise a plan to buy Victor Sweet off with the $400,000 from their mother's life insurance. When Sweet accepts, Angel sets off for Fowler's. Arriving at Fowler's, he subdues him. Jeremiah then goes to meet Sweet, while Angel's girlfriend, Sofi, heads to the police station, where she tells the police that Angel is planning to kill a police officer. Hearing the sirens in the distance, Fowler thinks they are coming for Angel, until Angel opens his jacket showing a wire. Angel claims the whole conversation was taped, including Fowler's admission that he killed Green. The police arrive at Fowler's in full force, and Fowler gets the upper hand on Angel.

Nascimento and his other colleagues are also shown in their armored car. Meanwhile, novice police officers Andr\u00e9 Matias (Andr\u00e9 Ramiro) and Neto Gouveia (Caio Junqueira) are shown riding a motorcycle at the same favela, though not with the other officers. Once they make it to a vantage point, Neto uses the telescope of a sniper rifle to check on the police team as they talk to some drug traffickers. Neto shoots one of them and provokes a deadly gunfight between police and thugs, both sides unaware of where the bullet came from, forcing Mathias and Neto to flee the scene. Nascimento leads his colleagues from BOPE, Rio Special Police Department, heading to the shootout to interfere and save the officers.Six months earlier, Nascimento and his wife Rosane (Maria Ribeiro) are shown during her pregnancy of their first child. Not wanting to be an absent father when his child is born, Nascimento decides to search for a successor for his role as a captain, since he will be promoted to Lieutenant Colonel. This coincides with an operation he will have to lead at Morro dos Prazeres in order to secure the location and clean it of drug dealers, so that Pope John Paul II can spend the night in Archbishop's home, located near the slum buildings and favelas. The operation will require daily trips into the favela filled with heavily armed drug lords, and Nascimento is initially against it, but is forced by his superiors to accept it as his last mission, due to Pope's regards and requirements which cannot be annulled.Meanwhile, Neto and Matias debut as police officers. Both are honest and try to stay out of corruption, but are soon disillusioned by their corrupt superiors. While Neto starts at the police auto mechanic shop as a supervisor, being in charge of the mechanics who are fixing run-down police cars and bikes with parts from newer cars, Matias is responsible for repairing and listening to the police dispatchers and registering and filing every complaint in his small archive office with two other officers. Both share a small apartment in Rio and are long-time friends and flatmates.Besides working at the local police, Matias is a Law student at \"the best new Law university of Rio\", according to Nascimento, where his classmates are shown as well-off young adults that tend to see the police as a repressive unit, while several others are selling marijuana around the campus. He soon befriends Roberta (Fernanda de Freitas), Edu (Paulo Viela) and Maria (Fernanda Machado) (whom he later dates). All three work at an NGO that takes care of poor children from a local favela. Roberta dates Rodrigues, who helps Maria administrate the organization, besides representing a senator who sponsors the NGO. All of them smoke marijuana regularly, with Edu being a salesman at his university for Baiano (F\u00e1bio Lago), the local drug lord, who allows the NGO to operate as long as it doesn't interfere with his business or bring police attention. None of the students or dealers are aware of Matias's police career as he keeps it a secret.Neto is soon tired of working at the mechanic, but fails to be transferred to another department. By riding with his superior Captain Fabio (Milhem Cortaz), he learns about corruption schemes adopted by police officers commonly, owners of small establishments pay periodic bribes to the police in exchange for their presence in front of their places, so they are safer. Another scheme, learned by Matias, is the relocation of dead bodies to other battalion's areas, so that one's criminal statistics will artificially decrease and leave less work to the department charged to the battalion, which Matias learns the hard way when his superiors rage at him for filling their department with files they are too lazy to solve. Also, because the local government had no budget to pay tow trucks, they decided to hire private tows and pay for every towed car - towing vehicles had since become a lucrative activity and corrupt officers are shown to own tow trucks.Wishing to raise some money to fix many police cars at once, Neto comes up with a plan to steal the bribes Oliveira collects periodically from the drug lords and asks Matias and Fabio to help him. Fabio declines, since he will not have a share in it. The duo succeeds in stealing the money, but Oliveira believes Fabio ordered them to do it and drags him to a baile funk in Babil\u00f4nia, where he plans to give him over to the gang so they can kill him. However, while Neto and Matias (demoted to cooks at the kitchen for being suspects) confront him, he tells them about the funk party, hinting that he is going to be killed. Neto and Matias follow them and arrive at the vantage point to protect Fabio. When one of the dealers touches his gun, Neto opens fire killing the dealer and provoking a gunfight between the police and dealers. Fabio takes cover behind a bar and engages in a shootout with Olivera's men while his two protectors fight some of the heavily-armed dealers with only two pistols, a rifle and a sub-machine gun, but quickly run out of ammo.Meanwhile, Nascimento is confronted by a woman claiming the body of her son, who was killed by drug lords after being forced to confess by Nascimento, who was then released knowingly of the danger. Feeling guilty and thinking of his upcoming child, Nascimento gathers some officers and goes after the body. Just as they are torturing a member of the boy's gang into telling them where they have left him, Nascimento is informed of the situation at Babil\u00f4nia and ordered to interfere. After rescuing the trapped officers at Babil\u00f4nia, Nascimento meets Matias and Neto and orders them to start loading up bodies, and they are photographed by the press in the process lifting the body of a local drug lord. They also learn that BOPE's training program is about to begin and they soon apply for it. Both decide to give it a try and Fabio joins them to escape from Oliveira. Meanwhile, Rafael, Nascimento's son, is born.Just when the NGO program is about to start, Maria and her friends are confronted by Baiano, who found out about Matias's job as an officer after seeing his picture at a newspaper carrying the body of the drug lord - whom he reveals to have been his friend and a partner from another neighborhood with whom has been dealing drugs. Baiano threatens them to get rid of Matias and then leaves.Meanwhile, BOPE's training program takes place over the course of a few weeks in the jungles of Brazil, and proves a tough challenge and all enrolled officers are subjected to severe physical and psychological punishments and are trained under extreme pressure \"in order to eliminate the weak and, mainly, punish the corrupt\", as Nascimento explains, as the goal is to eliminate all the corrupt and mentally weak officers and only keep the honest and tough ones. Many officers quit the program, including Fabio after he gets foot fungus, but Neto and Matias reach the final level, where they are brought into Nascimento's final operation. Neto also gets a BOPE tattoo.Matias, now rejected by Maria and her friends, confronts Edu and orders him to arrange a meeting with Romerito, a boy with eyesight problems he met at the NGO and is now willing to provide him with a pair of glasses. Because Matias is aware that he will be killed once inside the slum, he blackmails Edu into arranging the meeting at the base of the slum. However, Neto informs Matias that he arranged a job interview for the same day and hour and offers to go in his place to bring Romerito the glasses.Edu reveals to Baiano that he had been threatened by Matias, and the drug lord decides to take revenge on Matias for getting his friend killed, as well as interrupting his operations. After giving Romerito his glasses, Neto is taken down by Baiano and his men. Before finishing him off, Baiano sees Neto's tattoo and realizes he is a BOPE officer. Knowing that killing such an officer will invoke a heated search for himself, he kidnaps Roberta and Rodrigues and murders them, shooting Roberta in the head and necklacing Rodrigues, as a punishment for bringing a BOPE officer in his slum. He then goes into hiding in a Rio favela. Neto dies in the hospital soon after.Seeking revenge, Matias, Nascimento and their fellow BOPE officers start making daily incursions into Baiano's slum to torture criminals into telling them of his whereabouts. One of them reveals that Edu told Baiano about Matias's meeting, which ultimately led to Neto's death. In a rage, Matias interrupts a peace walk, beats Edu up and insults Maria and the others, accusing them of being nothing but spoiled hypocritical drug users working for a dealer to provide for their work. Finally, the officers discover the exact location of Baiano and raid the slum. Baiano tries to escape, but as he runs across the rooftops, he is shot in the leg. Nascimento holds him at gunpoint, but Baiano pleads to the captain not to shoot him in the face, in order to perserve his face \"for the wake\". Nascimento then walks away, grabs a shotgun, hands it to Matias and tells him to shoot Baiano in the head, as a final test to ascertain Matias's worthiness as his true successor. Matias points the gun to the drug-lord's face, cocks the slide, and shows visible hesitation, but does not point the gun away.

(March 2008) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)The film is broken into four separate features: \"The Library\", \"The Drowned\", \"The Cold\" and \"Whispers\". \"The Library\" segment is the wrap-around story, which begins and ends the movie.The Library[edit]In the wrap-around story of the film, H. P. Lovecraft (Jeffrey Combs) learns of a monastery where a copy of the Necronomicon is held. Having been a regular there for his research, he sets up an appointment, his cab driver told to wait outside. Taking insult when the head monk calls his work \"fiction\", Lovecraft insists that all his writings are true. Requesting to read the Alchemical Encyclopedia Vol. III, Lovecraft steals a key from another monk and flees to the cellar where the Necronomicon is being held. Unknown to him, a monk has seen him. Unlocking the vault where the book is held, the door closes behind Lovecraft unexpectedly, making him drop the key down a grating and into the water below. As that happens, one of the seals is opened.Lovecraft sits to read and record what he is reading. It's not specified if he sees visions of the future through the book, or if the book contains future accounts. It's likely the stories will come to pass, and for the Necronomicon have already passed, alluding to the Necronomicon's timelessness, as all the stories take place well beyond the 1920s.The Drowned[edit]Edward De LaPoer, a member of the De La Poer family, is tracked down in Sweden after inheriting an old, abandoned family hotel. Left a sealed envelope from Jethro De La Poer, he learns of his uncle's tragic death. Upon a boat trip return to New England, a crash on the shore killed Jethro's wife and son. Distraught, Jethro picked up a copy of the Holy Bible in front of several funeral mourners, tossed it into the fireplace and announced that any god who would take from him is not welcome in his home. That night, an odd fishman arrives and tells him he is \"not alone\", then leaves behind an English translation of the Necronomicon. Using the book, Jethro brings his family back to life. However, they are revived as unholy monsters with green glowing eyes and tentacles in their mouths. Feeling guilty, he chooses to commit suicide by casting himself off an upper floor balcony.Edward, distraught over a car accident years before which killed his wife, Clara, finds the Necronomicon and performs the ritual to revive her. That night, Clara arrives and asks to be invited in. Edward apologizes for the accident. Clara regurgitates tentacles from her mouth, and in a panic, Edward pushes her away. Clara angrily attacks, but Edward, with a sword taken from a nearby wall, cuts her. She turns into a tentacle leading underneath the floor. Drawn underground from the injury, the creature below destroys the main floor and rises, a gigantic monster with tentacles, one eye and a large mouth.

Confronting a woman at a local apartment building, he is invited in only to find the entire place is very cold. The woman he has confronted claims to suffer a rare skin condition which has left her sensitive to heat and light. Demanding the truth or his story runs as-is, Dale is told the story of Emily Osterman's arrival to Boston twenty years before.Emily had supposedly taken residence in the apartment building, and told by Lena, the owner, not to disturb the other tenant, Dr. Richard Madden, a scientist. Her first night, she is attacked by her sexually abusive stepfather, Sam, who has tracked her down. Running away, the two struggle on the steps leading to the next apartment. Dr. Madden opens his door, grabs Sam's arm and stabs his hand with a scalpel. The fall down from the stairs kills him. Emily is bandaged up and given medication. That night, Emily is roused by drilling noises and blood dripping from her ceiling. Heading upstairs, she finds Dr. Madden and Lena mutilating Sam. She passes out, to awaken later in her bed with a clean ceiling. Dr. Madden assures her she was having a nightmare.The next day while job hunting, Emily sees two cops with a flyer asking for information about the murder of Sam. She confronts Dr. Madden, and he comes clean: Though Sam was already dead from the fall, Dr. Madden claims he would have killed Sam regardless for what he had done to Emily. Dr. Madden reveals his copy of the Necronomicon and how he learned of its information on sustaining life. In the greenhouse, Dr. Madden proves this by injecting a wilted rose with a compound to revive it, claiming that as long as it is kept out of the sun, it will never die. The two have sex, with a distraught Lena spying on them.That night, Lena threatens to kill Emily if Emily will not kill her, as Lena is in love with Dr. Madden, a feeling that has never been returned. Emily flees, only to return months later. Upon arrival, Emily finds her boss from the diner in Dr. Madden's apartment, struggling to avoid death. Lena stabs the man in the back, killing him. Lena insists on killing Emily, but Dr. Madden will not allow it, the struggle destroying lab equipment in the process. The resulting fire injures Dr. Madden severely, and without his fresh injection of pure spinal fluid, feels no pain as his body disintegrates before he dies. Lena shoots Emily with a shotgun in revenge. Emily announces her pregnancy, and Lena, feeling a loyalty to Dr. Madden, saves her.Dale suspects the woman he's talking to is not Emily's daughter, but Emily herself, having contracted a disease from Dr. Madden during intercourse. Emily reveals he is right, and that she is still pregnant, hoping one day that her baby may be born. She also reveals that she has continued murdering for spinal fluid, and chooses to keep a supply stockpiled. Dale realizes his coffee has been drugged as an aged Lena approaches him, brandishing a syringe.Whispers[edit]During a pursuit of a suspect known as \"the Butcher\", two police officers, Paul and Sarah of the Philadelphia Police Department, are arguing over their failed relationship and the coming baby. The argument leads to a crash, flipping the cruiser upside down. Paul, having unbuckled his seat belt in the argument, is knocked out and dragged off by an unseen person. Sarah unbuckles herself, breaks the window and exits the vehicle. Unable to call for backup, she follows a blood trail alone.Inside the old warehouse, Sarah follows as Paul is taken down a service elevator. Sarah trips on a rope and falls through to the floor, saved from impact by the rope around her ankle. The rope breaks a second after. As she gets up, she finds a man in glasses, Harold Benedict. Insisting he is merely the landlord of the warehouse and the Butcher is a tenant, he offers to lead her to him. Downstairs, the two are shot at by Mrs. Benedict, a blind old woman. Sarah, sick of getting a run-around, takes the shotgun and orders the two to lead her to the Butcher. Mrs. Benedict indulges in gossip first, insisting she's not really Benedict's wife. She also claims the Butcher is an alien. While searching for the Butcher, Sarah makes her way to an underground cavern filled with bats and other gooey creatures, but the Benedicts pull the ladder from the hole, leaving Sarah trapped. As Sarah ventures through the cavern, she starts to become scared, even promising to keep her unborn child. She later sees Paul, but he has already been eaten by the bats that inhabit the cavern. His brains are needed by the bats to reproduce. The bats then begin to corner her. She later wakes up on a table where Mr. and Mrs. Benedict are seemingly trying to feed Sarah to the alien bats.Sarah suddenly wakes up in a hospital. Her mother and a doctor (who resemble the Benedicts) rush into her room. Sarah was forced to have an abortion as a result of the car accident earlier, but her mother insists that she will be forgiven if she forgives himself. Sarah wants to see Paul, but Paul is brain dead and turns out to be in the very same state that he was found back in the caverns. Sarah screams in terror in spite of her mother's pleas to not scare the baby. Sarah doesn't have a clue what her mother is talking about, as she thought the baby had to be aborted. Her mother opens her blouse and reveals that the baby is inside the womb of the alien-bat creatures. Sarah is even more scared especially after removing her bed sheets and finding out she has lost half of one of her arms. Suddenly, the hospital setting changes back into the cavern. Sarah is still on the table, about to become a meal for the alien bats. Harold wants to leave but Sarah still has the keys.The Library[edit]With the conclusion of the third tale, Lovecraft is confronted by the head monk, who assures him that all will be fine if he opens the door.

The Draags consider Oms animals, and while they keep some as pets, others live in the wilderness and are periodically slaughtered by the Draags, who wish to control their population. Draags have much longer lifespans than Oms, but reproduce much less.When an Om mother is teased to death by three Draag children, her orphaned infant is found by Master Sinh, a key Draag leader, and his daughter Tiva, who keeps the boy as a pet and names him Terr. Tiva loves Terr and is careful not to hurt him, but, in accordance with her parents' instructions, keeps him under control, giving him a collar with which she can pull him in any direction. She brings Terr to sessions in which she receives her education using headphones that transmit knowledge into her mind, and a defect in his collar allows him to receive the knowledge too. Around the time that Tiva grows into her teens and first performs Draag meditation, which allows the species to travel with their minds, she loses some interest in Terr, who has become a young man and acquired much Draag knowledge. He escapes into the wilderness, stealing Tiva's headphones.There he runs into a wild female Om, who cuts off his collar and introduces him to her tribe, which lives in an abandoned Draag park full of strange creatures and landscapes. Terr shows them how to use the headphones to acquire Draag knowledge and literacy, winning the right to do so in a duel. The literacy they gain allows them to read a Draag announcement that the park will be purged of Oms, and, when the purge comes, some are slaughtered by Draag technology while others escape, joining forces with another tribe. They are attacked by two Draag passers-by and manage to kill one of them before escaping to an abandoned Draag rocket depot, much to the outrage of Draag leaders. They live there for years, joined by many other Oms, and, due to the knowledge acquired from Terr's headphones, manage to replicate Draag technology, including two rockets; they hope to leave Ygam for its moon, the Fantastic Planet, and live there safe from Draags. When a large-scale Draag purge hits the depot and many Oms are slaughtered, a group led by Terr uses the rockets to flee to the Fantastic Planet, where they discover large statues that Draags travel to during meditation and use to meet beings from other galaxies in a strange ritual that maintains their species. The Oms destroy some of the statues, threatening the Draags' existence; the genocide is halted on Ygam, and, facing a crisis, the Draags sue for peace.

One of the four hijackers in the room informs Niimi that all they want is for him to publicly admit that his company handled lethal medicine that killed their friend and Fuyuko's father.

There is also sister Genevieve, nicknamed \"Gen\", making the Sullivans a happy family of eight. As the boys grow, they are doted upon by their mother and sister Genevieve and given stern but loving guidance by their father, who is a railroad freight conductor. Each day, the boys climb the water tower by the tracks and wave to their father as he passes by on the train. The brothers are shown getting into their fair share of trouble growing up: a fight, a near drowning (after which their mother makes them promise not to set foot on a boat again until they are adults), and accidentally flooding the kitchen.Skipping forward to 1939, only Al is still in high school. On the day that George wins a motorcycle race for the local motorcycle club The Black Hawks, Al meets Katherine Mary, (Anne Baxter) an only child who lives with her father. Despite their youth, Al and Katherine Mary fall in love. Believing that Al is too young, his brothers nearly break the couple up, but realize what they have done and apologize. Soon after, Katherine Mary and Al are married, and ten months later, are expecting a baby. Al is fired for taking the afternoon off to escort his wife to the doctor, but his brothers vow to help them out.Later, months after little Jimmy has been welcomed into the family, the Sullivans are relaxing on a Sunday December 7, 1941. They hear about the attack on Pearl Harbor on the radio. The boys realize that one of their friends, Bill Bascom (Bill Ball in real life), was on the USS Arizona and resolve to join the Navy to avenge him. Al decides that he cannot go with his brothers, due to his family responsibilities, but when Katherine Mary sees his despondent face, she tells him to go with the others to the recruiting station. The brothers insist that they serve on the same ship, but the recruiter states that the Navy can make no such guarantees. The brothers leave, but later, George receives his draft notice to report for military service to the U.S. Army. George writes to the Navy Department, obtaining official permission for the boys to serve together.Later, Tom, Alleta, and Katherine Mary eagerly await letters from their loved ones, who are serving aboard the USS Juneau in the Pacific. On November 13, 1942, a battle rages off the Solomon Islands, and the Juneau is hit with a torpedo. Four of the brothers find each other, then realize that the wounded George is below in sick bay. They rush down to get him when the call to abandon ship is ordered. When George insists they leave him behind, Al replies, \"We can't go swimming without you.\" Just then, another enemy torpedo hits the ship as it is being evacuated and the ship explodes in a massive fireball, killing all of the crewmen left on board.... including all five of the Sullivan brothers.A few days alter, the same recruiter from before visits the Sullivan home and tells Katherine Mary, Tom, Alleta, and Gen that all five of the brothers were killed in action. Stunned, Tom goes to work and salutes the water tower on which his sons used to stand and wave to him. Sometime later, Tom, Katherine Mary, and Gen, who has joined the WAVES, watch with pride while Alleta christens a new destroyer, the USS The Sullivans.

Loneliness quickly sets in as Joanna, a mildly rebellious aspiring photographer, finds the women in town all look great and are obsessed with housework, but have few intellectual interests. The men all belong to the clubbish Stepford Men's Association, which Walter joins to Joanna's dismay. Neighbor Carol Van Sant's (Nanette Newman) sexually submissive behavior to her husband Ted, and her odd, repetitive behavior after a car accident also strike Joanna as unusual.Things start to look up when she makes friends with another newcomer to town, sloppy, irrepressible Bobbie Markowe (Paula Prentiss). Along with glossy trophy wife Charmaine Wimperis (Tina Louise), they organize a Women's Lib consciousness raising session, but the meeting is a failure when the other wives hijack the meeting with cleaning concerns. Joanna is also unimpressed by the boorish Men's Club members, including intimidating president Dale \"Dis\" Coba (Patrick O'Neal); stealthily, they collect information on Joanna including her picture, her voice, and other personal details. When Charmaine turns overnight from a languid, self-concerned tennis fan into an industrious, devoted wife, Joanna and Bobbie start investigating, with ever-increasing concern, the reason behind the submissive and bland behavior of the other wives, especially when they learn they were once quite supportive of liberal social policies.Spooked, Bobbie and Joanna start house hunting in other towns, and later, Joanna wins a prestigious contract with a photo gallery with some photographs of their respective children. When she excitedly tells Bobbie her good news, Joanna is shocked to find her freewheeling and liberal friend has abruptly changed into another clean, conservative housewife, with no intention of moving from town.Joanna panics and at the insistence of Walter, visits a psychiatrist where she voices her belief that all the men in the town are behind a conspiracy of somehow changing the women. The psychiatrist recommends she leave town until she feels safe, but when Joanna returns home, the children are missing. The marriage devolves into domestic violence when Joanna and Walter get in to a physical scuffle. In an attempt to find her children, she hypothesizes Bobbie may be caring for them. Joanna, still mystified by Bobbie's behavior, is desperate to prove her humanity but intuitively stabs Bobbie with a kitchen knife. But Bobbie doesn't bleed or suffer, instead going into a loop of odd mechanical behavior, thus revealing she is a robot.Despite feeling she may be the next victim, Joanna sneaks into the mansion which houses the Men's Association to find her children. There, she finds the mastermind of the whole operation, Dale \"Dis\" Coba, and eventually her own robot-duplicate. Joanna is shocked into paralysis when she witnesses its soulless, black, empty eyes.

Initially reluctant, the group eventually decides to evade the authority of Mikey's older brother, Brandon, and escape for one last \"Goonie adventure\".They head down the coast and stumble upon a derelict seaside restaurant that seems to match coordinates set by the map and an old doubloon, unaware that the Fratellis, a family of fugitives, are using the restaurant as their hideout. After first encountering the family, the Goonies come back after the Fratellis have left and discover their criminal intents, and send Chunk, the group's clumsy, heavy-set dreamer and teller of tall tales, to get help. However, the Fratellis return before they can leave, forcing the Goonies to use a cavern underneath the restaurant to escape. The Fratellis capture Chunk and interrogate him, learning nothing until a pack of bats burst out of the cavern beneath the restaurant. Chunk is placed in the same room with the forsaken and deformed Fratelli brother, Sloth, while the rest of the Fratellis enter the cavern and follow the Goonies' trail.As the Goonies traverse the cavern, Mikey discovers that it matches up with the map and convinces the rest of the group to continue to follow it to find the treasure. They overcome many deadly traps set by One-Eyed Willie, and eventually arrive at a large underground cavern and a lagoon where Willie's ship, the Inferno, lies waiting.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (March 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)In late 1944, the remnants of a platoon of German Panzergrenadiers from the Gro\u00c3\u009fdeutschland Division are caught in an ambush by American troops. In their retreat, they find a German bunker manned by elderly Pvt. Mirus (John Carlisle) and young Pvt. Neumann (Andrew-Lee Potts) who had been left to defend the bunker under orders from Area Command to wait until relieved. Schenke confronts Heydrich about why the group didn't counter-attack the Americans, claiming that there couldn't have been that many of them. Mirus expands on the history of the area, revealing that victims of the Black Plague were massacred on the orders of a stranger, who influenced the townspeople to turn against one another. Low on ammunition, the men are haunted by bad dreams, memories and the feeling that something about the area just isn't right.As the night proceeds, strange tunnels are found beneath the bunker and the situation in the bunker becomes increasingly tense. Pvt. Schenke (Andrew Tiernan) wants to explore the tunnels but Lt. Krupp (Simon Kunz) orders against it. Later, Mirus sneaks down into the tunnels and a curious Pfc. Kruezmann (Eddie Marsan) follows him. When they are discovered to be missing, Lt. Krupp believes they've deserted and orders a pursuit. Interrogation of Neumann reveals that Mirus had been wandering off into the tunnels for several weeks and treats the tunnels as his property, as if something is down there that Mirus doesn't want him to know about. Cpl. Baumann (Jason Flemyng) discovers a set of plans for the complex while Cpl. Ebert (Jack Davenport) finds a danger sign. Exploring further, Ebert comes to a mine shaft where he hears movement and a pile of sand nearly falls on top of him. Terrified, he is suddenly stabbed from behind. As he lays dying, a silhouetted figure resembling Kreutzmann walks up. Baumann hears his scream and packs up the papers to investigate when his torch dies. He lights a match and, seeing figures walking towards him, aims his weapon, but they turn out to be his comrades. When Lt. Krupp tries the torch, it turns on easily.Baumann thinks that the Americans are in the tunnels. The group then hears movement, which turns out to be Mirus. The soldiers turn on a rusty old generator, causing lights to turn on down in the tunnels. Lt. Krupp asks Mirus what's going on but Mirus is evasive. Before the questioning can go any further, the men hear machine gun fire coming from the bunker. When the men arrive, it appears that Neumann, Franke and Schenke had been firing at nothing. Lt. Krupp attempts to call headquarters, but the phone lines are dead. Convinced that the Americans have entered the tunnels, a game of cat and mouse develops. Stalked by shadowy figures, it becomes increasingly unclear where the men's fantasies end and the danger begins. Krupp agrees to send an expedition to secure the back entrance to the tunnels but on condition that if too much resistance is encountered they return. Mirus and Neumann are left behind in the bunker, while the remaining men split up: Krupp and Schenke in one group and Baumann, Franke and Neumann in the other. Before leaving, Schenke gives a Nazi salute, which none of the men in the other group return. Neumann stands guard while Mirus scorns the whole idea of trying to fight anymore. Mirus then claims that his son Werner, who died in Normandy, still talks to him and told him something about the tunnels.Down in the tunnels, Schenke and Krupp force their way into an ammunition storage room only to find nothing but shells. Arriving at the rear entrance, they find it is sealed but Schenke hypothesises that there's another way in. They continue searching and discover Ebert's body. The other group comes across the mine shaft and discover a mass grave. Following a voice, they find Kreutzmann, catatonic and repeatedly screaming \"no\". Kreutzmann begins babbling about someone being back. They hear a women's voice and try to get Kreutzmann out but Kreutzmann resists them. He breaks away, knocking Baumann out cold. He then hallucinates a soldier with his throat ripped out while two others take pictures and runs off. Lt. Krupp and Schenke explore a corridor when the lights begin to flicker. They hear movement and look, only to spin around a second later when they hear movement behind them and see a lamp swinging from side to side. They slowly back down the corridor to the back door of the tunnel complex. They hear loud banging as something tries to break into the tunnels. Kreutzmann comes rushing up the tunnel, screaming. Startled, Schenke and Kruppe open fire, killing him. The gunfire causes a collapse, burying Lt. Krupp under a pile of wooden beams. When Schenke realises it was Kreutzmann that they killed, he begins laughing hysterically.Back in the bunker, Neumann hears the gunfire and ventures down into the tunnels despite Mirus' protests. Alone, Mirus sees a shadowy figure and takes off in panic. As he flees, he hears pounding on each consecutive door he closes behind him, as if he is being pursued. Mirus leaves the bunker and falls outside into the barbed wire. He sees another dark figure approaching and in his panic to escape becomes more and more tangled in the barbed wire. Meanwhile, Neumann, who is searching through the tunnels, is caught by an increasingly paranoid Schenke, who puts a knife to his neck. Neumann regains his trust him and the two return to the artillery ammunition room and booby trap the room to prevent the shells from falling into the hands of the Americans, whom Schenke is sure are stalking through the tunnels. Heydrich, Baumann and Franke decide to blow the bunker door with a stick grenade and fight their way out. Schenke and Neumann hear the explosion and think that the Americans have set off a booby trap.Schenke lights a fuse to destroy the artillery ammo and the two of them move out. Heydrich, Baumann and Franke's plan to blast the door open fails so they go looking for another entrance. They run into Schenke and Neumann, who thinking that the three of them are Americans, open fire. A short firefight ensues in which Heydrich, Franke and Baumann use up their remaining STG-44 ammo they withdraw. Franke finally cracks and offers to surrender but it turns out that instead of Americans, Schenke is the one in the corridor. He looks rather deranged at this point. Neumann comes up and aims his Kar98K rifle at Heydrich, Baumann and Franke as Schenke basically announces his plan to execute the three of them. When Neumann refuses to execute the three of them Schneke pulls out his Luger and executes Franke. He then puts the gun to Neumann's head and threatens to kill him. Neumann is about to pull the trigger when the explosives go off, knocking everybody down. Heydrich, Baumann and Neumann make a run for it while Schenke wildly fires his pistol after them. The three men race through the tunnels but the main exit is blocked by wreckage. Heydrich pulls Neumann into the mine shaft to get away, but Baumann who is holding the rifle, stays behind and shoots at the helmeted figure approaching. To his amazement and terror the bullets seem to do nothing. He then begins hallucinating and fires a third shot before Heydrich pulls him away. Soon Schenke arrives, but the others have already erected a barricade over the mine shaft entrance.The men stumble across the mass grave again and then Schenke appears, destroying the barricade. Heydrich shoots Schenke in the chest with a flare gun and Schenke suddenly bursts into flames, screaming and reeling away. The three men begin whacking at the mass grave wall with entrenching tools, which break ground. Neumann breaks out and Heydrich is about to follow him when he's stabbed in the back by Schenke, who seems to have put his flames out, despite being badly burned. Baumann launches himself at Schenke and the two begin a fight, which seems even for a while, until Schenke throws Baumann back. Heydrich intervenes, only to get run through by Schenke. The distraction gives Baumann time to get away. Baumann breaks through a layer of soil made up of bones, which seems to try and suck him back into the earth, but is pulled out by Neumann. Baumann then rolls over and hurls a grenade down into the hole, which lands next to the gravely injured Schenke. Several seconds before it explodes, Schenke sees several silhouetted figures standing nearby.The movie then cuts to Neman and Baumann running away as the grenade explodes behind them, presumably killing Schenke. Neumann then checks out the bunker from the rear, and comes back to tell the wounded Baumann that it's safe. Baumann gives Neumann a handkerchief and tells him to go surrender. Neumann wants to stay but Baumann refuses, telling Neumann to leave. Neumann agrees to leave and on his way down the road finds Mirus' body tangled up in the barbed wire. He then sees American soldiers emerging from the woods and waves his handkerchief to get their attention. The film then cuts back to Baumann's memories which show the squad advancing across a sunny field only to find a bunch of deserters about to be executed. An officer hustles over Baumann to participate in the execution. One of the deserters is seen praying and Baumann misses his first shot before shooting the man twice. Quickly the firing squad moves in, with one soldier taking pictures with his camera and an officer finishing off the wounded with a pistol. A member of the firing squad is seen striking a pose while the picture-taking soldier snaps another shot. Baumann snaps out of remembering and staggers off towards the Americans.", "output": "What exploded behind Neman and Baumann?", "category": "Question Generation 821.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Six weeks later, CIA Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) divulges the audiotaped confession of Ward Abbott, the late former head of Treadstone, to Director Ezra Kramer (Scott Glenn). Meanwhile, in Turin, journalist Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) of The Guardian meets an informant to learn about Bourne and Operation Blackbriar, the program succeeding Treadstone. The CIA tracks Ross as he returns to London, after his mention of \"Blackbriar\" during a cell-phone call to his editor is detected by the ECHELON system. Bourne reappears in Paris to inform Martin Kreutz (Daniel Br\u00c3\u00bchl), the step-brother of his girlfriend Marie Helena Kreutz (Franka Potente), of her assassination in India, also in the previous film.Bourne reads Ross's articles and arranges a meeting with him at London Waterloo station. Bourne realizes that the CIA is following Ross and helps him evade capture for a while, but when Ross panics and ignores Bourne's instructions, Blackbriar assassin Paz (\u00c3\u0089dgar Ram\u00c3\u00adrez) shoots him dead, in the middle of a busy station, on orders of Deputy Director Noah Vosen (David Strathairn). Vosen's team, reluctantly assisted by Landy, analyzes Ross's notes and identifies his source as Neal Daniels (Colin Stinton), a CIA Station chief involved with Treadstone and Blackbriar. Bourne makes his way to Daniels's office in Madrid but finds it empty. He incapacitates gunmen sent by Vosen and Landy. Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles), a former Treadstone operative who shares a history with Bourne, tells him that Daniels has fled to Tangier and aids his escape from an arriving CIA unit.Parsons learns that Blackbriar \"asset\" Desh Bouksani (Joey Ansah) has been tasked with killing Daniels. Vosen sees that Parsons accessed information about Daniels and sends Bouksani after Parsons and Bourne as well, a decision with which Landy fiercely disagrees. Bourne follows Bouksani to Daniels but fails to prevent Daniels's death by a planted bomb. However, Bourne manages to kill Bouksani before he can kill Parsons. After sending Parsons into hiding, Bourne examines the contents of Daniels's briefcase and finds the address of the deep-cover CIA bureau in New York City, where Vosen directs Blackbriar. Bourne travels to New York.Landy receives a phone call from Bourne, which is intercepted by Vosen. When Landy tells him that his real name is David Webb and gives him the birth date \"4-15-71\", Bourne tells Landy to \"get some rest\" because she \"look[s] tired\", tipping off his presence in New York (a scene replicated from the end of the previous film). Vosen intercepts a text to Landy from Bourne apparently of a location to meet up and leaves his office with a whole team. Bourne however waits for them all to leave, enters Vosen's office and takes classified Blackbriar documents. Realizing that he has been hoodwinked, Vosen sends Paz after Bourne, but the resulting car chase ends with Bourne forcing Paz's car to crash into a concrete barrier. Bourne holds the injured Paz at gunpoint, but spares his life.Bourne arrives at a hospital at 415 East 71st Street, having figured out Landy's coded message. Outside, Bourne meets Landy and gives her the Blackbriar files before going inside. Vosen also figures out Landy's code and warns Dr. Albert Hirsch (Albert Finney), who ran Treadstone's behavior modification program, that Bourne is coming. He follows Landy inside the building but is too late to stop her from faxing the Blackbriar documents out. Meanwhile, Bourne confronts Hirsch on an upper floor and remembers that he volunteered for Treadstone. As Bourne flees to the roof, he is confronted by Paz, who asks, \"Why didn't you take the shot?\" Bourne repeats the dying words of The Professor in The Bourne Identity: \"Look at us. Look at what they make you give.\" Paz lowers his gun, but Vosen appears and shoots at Bourne as he jumps into the East River.Some time later, Parsons watches a news broadcast about the exposure of Operation Blackbriar, the arrests of Hirsch and Vosen, a criminal investigation against Kramer, and the whereabouts of David Webb, a.k.a. Jason Bourne. Upon hearing that his body has not been found after a three-day search of the river, Parsons smiles.

The two soon realize they have attacked the wrong Jeffrey Lebowski and leave, but not before one of them urinates on the Dude's rug.The Dude meets his bowling friends, the timid Donny (Steve Buscemi) and the temperamental Vietnam veteran Walter Sobchak (John Goodman). Encouraged by Walter, the Dude approaches the other Jeffrey Lebowski (David Huddleston), the eponymous \"Big Lebowski\", a cantankerous elderly wheelchair-bound millionaire, to seek compensation for his ruined rug. Though his request is promptly refused, he craftily steals one of Lebowski's rugs by telling Brandt (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Lebowski's sycophantic assistant, that his boss told him to take any rug in the house. The Dude subsequently meets Bunny (Tara Reid), Lebowski's young nymphomaniacal trophy wife.Days later, Lebowski contacts the Dude stating that Bunny has been kidnapped. Lebowski wants the Dude to deliver a briefcase containing a million-dollar ransom and see if he can recognize the culprits. Later, a different pair of thugs appear in the Dude's apartment, knock him unconscious, and take Lebowski's rug. When Bunny's kidnappers call to arrange delivery of the ransom, Walter suggests they give the kidnappers a ringer instead, namely a briefcase filled with dirty underwear laundry. The kidnappers grab the ringer and leave. Later that night, the Dude's car is stolen, with the real ransom briefcase still inside.Jeffrey Lebowski's daughter Maude (Julianne Moore) contacts the Dude and reveals she took the rug, explaining that Bunny is one of Jackie Treehorn's porn stars. She reckons that Bunny \"kidnapped\" herself and asks the Dude to recover the ransom which Lebowski illegally withdrew from the family's foundation. Lebowski is angry that the Dude failed to deliver the ransom and shows him a severed green-painted toe, allegedly belonging to Bunny, delivered by the kidnappers. Later, a gang of German nihilists (Peter Stormare, Torsten Voges, and Flea) invade the Dude's apartment and threaten him, identifying themselves as the kidnappers. Maude says the German nihilists are actually Bunny's friends.The Dude's car is found by the police without the ransom money, and he reclaims it. Later, while cruising around in the car, The Dude finds the homework assignment of a high school student named Larry inside. Taking this to mean that Larry was the one who stole the car, Walter and The Dude go to his house, believing Larry has also stolen the money. When Larry refuses to respond to Walter and the Dude's threats, Walter wrecks a new sports car parked outside which they assume Larry bought with the money. However, a neighbor rushes outside, reveals himself as having just bought the car and angrily wrecks The Dude's car in revenge, thinking it to be Walter's.The Dude is forcibly brought before Treehorn, who asks about the whereabouts of Bunny and says he wants the money she owes him. He drugs the Dude's White Russian cocktail, leading to an unconscious dream sequence involving Maude and bowling. The Dude comes to in police custody, where he is verbally and physically assaulted by the Malibu police chief. During the cab ride home, the Dude gets thrown out after he asks the cab driver to simply change the radio station. A red sports car zooms past and the viewer sees that Bunny is driving, with all her toes intact.The Dude finds his bungalow completely trashed and is greeted by Maude, who seduces him. He figures that Treehorn drugged him so that his goons could look for the ransom money at the Dude's home. After Maude has sex with him, she says she hopes to conceive a child; the Dude is about to protest the idea of being a father but Maude tells him that he doesn't have to have a hand in the child's upbringing. Maude also explains that her father has no money: her mother was the wealthy one and she left her money exclusively to the family charity. The Dude later tells Walter that he now understands the whole story: when Lebowski\u00e2\u0080\u0094who apparently hated his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0094heard that Bunny was kidnapped, he withdrew money from the foundation, kept it for himself, and gave the Dude a briefcase without any money in it, saying that it contained a million dollar ransom. The kidnapping was also a ruse: when Bunny took an unannounced trip, her friends (the nihilists) faked a kidnapping to be able to extort money from Lebowski. Walter and the Dude confront the Big Lebowski, who refuses to admit responsibility, but is thrown out of his wheelchair by Walter, who believes that he's faking his paralysis.The affair apparently over, the Dude and his bowling teammates return to the bowling alley. When they leave, they are confronted in the parking lot by the nihilists who have set the Dude's car on fire. They, once again, demand the ransom money. After hearing what the Dude and Walter know, the nihilists try to mug them anyway. Walter violently overcomes all three, biting the ear off one of them. However, in the excitement, Donny suffers a fatal heart attack.Walter and the Dude go to the beach to scatter Donny's ashes. Walter turns an informal eulogy into a tribute to the Vietnam War. After accidentally covering the Dude with Donny's ashes, and after a brief argument, Walter hugs him and says, \"Come on, Dude. Fuck it, man. Let's go bowling.\" At the bowling alley, the story's narrator (Sam Elliott) tells the viewer that Maude is pregnant with a \"little Lebowski\" and expresses his hope that the Dude and Walter will win the bowling tournament.", "output": "Where is The Dude when he comes to?", "category": "Question Generation 821.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

They are invited to join a party on the bus.The group arrives at their destination, only to learn that a curse rests over the village and that every female child turns into a lesbian vampire on her eighteenth birthday. There is an old legend stating that the Vampire Queen, Carmilla, descended on the village, killed its menfolk and seduced its women to her evil. When the ruler of the land, Baron Wolfgang Mclaren (Jimmy's great ancestor) returned from the Crusades, he discovered one of the women corrupted by Carmilla was his wife, Eva.

Vicky and Juan Antonio proceed to spend the weekend together alone while they wait for Cristina to recuperate. Vicky gradually changes her opinion of Juan Antonio as he tells her about his tumultuous relationship with his former wife, Mar\u00c3\u00ada Elena (Pen\u00c3\u00a9lope Cruz). Vicky accompanies him to visit his father, an old poet, and then becomes deeply moved by a Spanish guitar performance later that evening. She finally succumbs to Juan Antonio's advances as they walk through a grove of trees in the dark. The next day, with Cristina recovered, the three of them fly back to Barcelona.Feeling guilty, Vicky does not mention the incident to Cristina, and the two begin to grow apart. Vicky starts throwing herself into her studies while Cristina and Juan Antonio take up a relationship. Cristina then moves in with Juan Antonio and begins to discover more about his past. After learning that Mar\u00c3\u00ada Elena attempted to kill herself, Juan Antonio brings her to his home, where Cristina already lives. After some defiance, the two women grow fond of each other. Cristina realizes that the ex-spouses are still in love, and Mar\u00c3\u00ada Elena suggests that Cristina may be the element that can give balance and stability to their relationship. All three become romantically involved with one another.In the meantime, Vicky is joined in Spain by an enthusiastic Doug and the two get married. When Cristina describes her new life with Juan Antonio to Vicky, Vicky becomes secretly jealous, and after a few other awkward moments, she realizes she is unsatisfied in her married life and is still attracted to Juan Antonio. Learning that Judy is similarly unhappy in her marriage, she confides to her, and Judy, who sees her younger self in Vicky, decides to bring Juan Antonio and Vicky together. Meanwhile, Cristina becomes restless and at some point decides to leave Juan Antonio and Mar\u00c3\u00ada Elena; without her, their relationship quickly falls apart again.As the summer winds to a close, Judy arranges for Juan Antonio and Vicky to meet at a party. Juan Antonio begs Vicky to meet him again privately before leaving Spain, which she finally accepts, lying to Doug in the process. At his home, Juan Antonio seduces and wins Vicky over again, but they are interrupted by Mar\u00c3\u00ada Elena who bursts in with a gun, firing wildly as Juan Antonio tries to calm her. Vicky gets shot in the hand in the process, and leaves, shouting they are insane and she could never live like this. She confesses the entire story to Cristina, who never realized how Vicky felt about Juan Antonio, and wishes she could have helped her. Doug, Vicky and Cristina return to America; Doug never learns what truly happened, Vicky goes back to her married life, and Cristina is back where she started, unsure of what she wants.", "output": "Who takes up a relationship?", "category": "Question Generation 821.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

When Lee is arrested by the police, he begins hallucinating because of \"bug powder\" exposure. He believes he is a secret agent with two handlers or controllers in the forms of a talking insectoid typewriter and an alien \"Mugwump\". The bug assigns him the mission of killing Joan. She is allegedly an agent of an organization called Interzone Incorporated. Lee dismisses the bug and its instructions and kills it. He returns home to find Joan having sex with Hank, one of his writer friends. Shortly afterwards, he accidentally kills her while attempting to shoot a drinking glass off her head in imitation of William Tell.Having inadvertently accomplished his \"mission\", Lee flees to Interzone. He spends his time writing reports for his imaginary handler, and it is these documents which, at the insistence of his literary colleagues, eventually become the titular book. Whilst Lee is under the influence of assorted mind-altering substances, his replacement typewriter, a Clark Nova, becomes a talking insect which tells him to find Dr. Benway by seducing Joan Frost. Joan, curiously, is a doppelg\u00c3\u00a4nger of his dead wife.After coming to the conclusion that Dr. Benway is, in fact, the secret mastermind of a narcotics operation for a drug called \"black meat\" which is supposedly derived from the guts of giant centipedes, Lee completes his report and flees Interzone to Annexia with Joan Frost.Stopped by the Annexian border patrol and instructed to prove that he is a writer as he claims, Lee produces a pen. As this is insufficient proof for passage he inexplicably offers a demonstration of his William Tell routine using a glass atop Joan Frost's head.

Dreyfus promptly escapes from the asylum and once again tries to kill Clouseau by planting a bomb while the Inspector (by periodic arrangement) duels with his manservant Cato (Burt Kwouk). The bomb destroys Clouseau's apartment and injures Cato, but Clouseau himself is unharmed, being lifted from the room by an inflatable disguise. Deciding that a more elaborate plan is needed, Dreyfus enlists an army of criminals to his cause and kidnaps nuclear physicist Professor Hugo Fassbender (Richard Vernon) and the Professor's daughter Margo (Briony McRoberts), forcing the professor to build a \"doomsday weapon\" in return for his daughter's freedom.Clouseau travels to England to investigate Fassbender's disappearance, where he wrecks their family home and ineptly interrogates Jarvis (Michael Robbins), Fassbender's cross-dressing butler. Although Jarvis is killed by the kidnappers, to whom he had become a dangerous witness, Clouseau discovers a clue that leads him to the Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany. Meanwhile, Dreyfus, using Fassbender's invention, dissolves the United Nations headquarters in New York City and blackmails the leaders of the world, including the President of the United States and his adviser (based on Gerald Ford and Henry Kissinger), into assassinating Clouseau. However, many of the nations instruct their operatives to kill the other assassins to gain Dreyfus's favor and possibly the Doomsday Machine. As a result of their orders and Clouseau's habitual clumsiness, the assassins all end up killing each other until only the agents of Egypt and Russia remain.The Egyptian assassin (an uncredited cameo by Omar Sharif) shoots one of Dreyfus' henchmen, mistaking him for Clouseau, but is seduced by the Russian operative Olga Bariosova (Lesley-Anne Down), who makes the same mistake. When the real Clouseau arrives, he is perplexed by Olga's affections but learns from her Dreyfus's location at a castle in Bavaria. Dreyfus is elated at Clouseau's apparent demise, but suffers from a toothache; Clouseau, disguised as a dentist, sneaks into the castle - eventually (his entry frustrated by the castle's drawbridge). Not recognized by Dreyfus, Clouseau ends up intoxicating both of them with nitrous oxide. Realising the deception when Clouseau mistakenly pulls the wrong tooth, Dreyfus prepares to use the machine to destroy England. Clouseau, eluding Dreyfus's henchmen, unwittingly foils Dreyfus's plans when a medieval catapult outside the castle launches Clouseau on top of the Doomsday machine. The machine begins to malfunction and begins firing on Dreyfus and the castle itself. As the remaining henchmen, Fassbender and his daughter, and eventually Clouseau himself escape the dissolving castle, Dreyfus plays \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\" on the castle's pipe organ, while himself disintegrating, until he and the castle vanish.Returning to Paris, Clouseau is finally reunited with Olga. However, their tryst is interrupted first by Clouseau's apparent inability to remove his clothes without a struggle, and then by Cato, whereupon all three are hurled by the reclining bed into the Seine. Immediately thereafter, a cartoon image of Clouseau begins swimming, unaware that a gigantic version of the Pink Panther character is waiting below him (a reference to the film Jaws, made obvious by the thematic music as the movie ends).", "output": "Which assassins still remain in the end?", "category": "Question Generation 821.json"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

At the female penitentiary, some new characters are introduced, along with returning character Gretchen.Across the yard is a neighboring men's prison, where General Krantz and T-Bag are being held. Receiving word of Sara's incarceration, Krantz puts out a $100,000 bounty on Sara's head. Sara is quickly poisoned, but is given medical treatment. She assumes Gretchen was behind the poisoning.Michael soon learns of the bounty, and decides that he must break her out. He once again enlists Lincoln and Sucre's help. Lincoln and Sucre stake out the prison, taking photographs of the cameras and creating a rough layout of the prison. Gretchen sees Lincoln and Sucre, and forcibly asks Sara to include her in any escape plan that may be developing.After meticulously analyzing the photographs and plans of the prison, Michael finds a fault in the security system. Mahone then arrives and offers his aid, although his true intentions are unclear, as he had just been offered reinstatement with the FBI on the condition that he find and report any evidence incriminating Michael.Michael exploits the fault to come up with an escape plan, which he relays to Sara using a hidden message written in a letter. While he is out however, FBI agent Wheatley breaks into Michael's apartment, and sees the plans laid out on table. When Michael arrives, he points out that the plans look very incriminating, but Michael claims that he was merely looking for any faults, so that he could describe them to the prison warden, in the hopes that she may grant him visitation rights.Visitation rights are eventually granted, so Michael visits Sara and, because the visit is supervised, subtly asks her if she understood the hidden message, which she implies that she does. However, just after leaving the prison, Michael finds out that Agent Wheatley also discovered the fault which Michael planned to exploit, and sees the camera system being adjusted, putting a halt to the escape plan.Meanwhile, Sara joins the \"family\" of the leader of the prisoners, an inmate who goes by the name of \"Daddy\", in order to join the work detail and gain access to the yard.Michael soon comes up with a daring plan which Lincoln strongly recommends against, to somehow parachute right outside the Prison Yard and rescue Sara. Realizing the difficulty of such a task, Michael asks Lincoln to enlist the aid of T-Bag. Since T-Bag would clearly be hold a grudge against Michael, Michael tells Lincoln to offer him a cash reward of $5,000. During the meeting, T-Bag demands a greater reward than the brothers can provide. But, because the General refused to provide any financial incentive for T-Bag's help, T-Bag tells Lincoln how he may rob the man who holds the General's $100,000, in exchange for which he would be willing to help. Lincoln agrees to steal the money, and tells T-Bag to simply pull the fire alarm at the opportune time. Lincoln and Sucre then proceed to successfully rob the man, and guarantee the transfer of funds to T-Bag.Wanting to get to Sara, Gretchen persuades one of the guards to search Daddy's room. The Guards do so, and, finding drugs in the trash can, take Daddy to lockup.While waiting near the showers, Sara is attacked by a fellow member of the family, but Gretchen comes to her rescue, inadvertently killing the attacker in the process. Gretchen then pleads with Sara to bring her along in the escape, because she wishes to see her daughter, Emily, and give her a personally made gift. When one of the guards tells Daddy of the death of her family member, and mentions that Sara and Gretchen are thought to be behind her killing, Daddy becomes infuriated.Following several phone calls with Agent Wheatley, in which Mahone divulged Michael's plot including the parachuting plan, it appears as though Mahone has betrayed Michael. But Michael continues to trust him, and gives him a piece of paper and a DVD which he says to give to Sara, in the event of his death. Michael then visits Sara once more, telling her that the previous escape plan has been rendered impossible. But he cryptically tells her of a new plan, in which she must get to the chapel, which is linked to the outside via an underground connection to an administrative building.Daddy is eventually freed from Lockup, and appears to be quietly stalking Sara and Gretchen. Just before the escape begins, Gretchen distracts a guard, and Sara confronts Daddy. Following a short explanation, Sara picks a fight with Daddy and purposely pushes her into a powerful and frightening inmate, who then retaliates by attacking Daddy. At the same time, Gretchen punches the guard and knocks her to the ground, but gets stabbed in the leg during the altercation. Sara quickly grabs the guards' keys, and the two of them hide in the kitchen amidst the chaos.Michael then begins the escape. Knowing of the plan thanks to Mahone's information, agent Wheatley orders all lights to be shut off, and positions armed officers ready to kill, near Michael's landing site. When the parachute lands, it is riddled with bullets. However, when Wheatley approaches, the parachuter is revealed to be simply a dummy, and Michael is seen sneaking out from under Wheatley's car, and runs into position.With the escape underway, Gretchen admits to Sara that she cannot continue on without help, due to her injuries. Gretchen then asks her to choose, either to leave her behind or help her along. Sara chooses to help Gretchen, because she rescued her during the attack. However, as they run to the chapel, Gretchen is spotted by guards. She is asked whether she is alone, but Gretchen refuses to divulge Sara's presence, and stalls the guards by telling them she merely wished to escape to be with her daughter. Though Sara is almost spotted when a guard comes closer, she manages to unlock the door and get into the Chapel, at which point the guards are called away, and Gretchen is again taken into custody. But before leaving, Sara sees the necklace that Gretchen made for Emily on the ground, and, knowing that she got away thanks to Gretchen, picks it up so that she may pass it on to her daughter.Michael finally meets with Sara, and they wait sit, waiting. Sucre is supposed to transfer the money to T-Bag's bank account, but sees that the bank is closed. When T-Bag finds out that the transfer did not take place as promised, he angrily reveals the plot to the warden, and tells her that he was instructed to pull the fire alarm. The warden responds by turning all fire alarms off.This however, turns out to be part of Michael's plan, as he figured that T-Bag would reveal the plan. With the alarms off, he then heats up a locked door with a blowtorch, managing to force it open. However, when they try to escape through the next door, which is electronically locked, they reach a roadblock. Knowing that this was a possibility from the beginning, Michael asks Sara to run as soon as the door opens, and leave him behind, since the only way to open the door is to manually cause a power surge that will certainly kill him. Sara refuses to leave if Michael cannot go with her, but he emphasizes that there is no other way, touching her stomach and saying that he will be going with her. In one final act of sacrifice, Michael causes the surge, and sparks are shown coming from the fuse box. Sara then runs out, with Lincoln, Sucre, and Mahone waiting with a van just outside. Stunned, Sara is unable to describe to Lincoln what just happened. Mahone, who purposely misled the Agents, revealed that he knew of Michael's plan from a previous discussion, and simply tells Lincoln, \"He's Gone\". They get into the van and drive away, still shocked over Michael's fate.Back at the prison, T-Bag is put into solitary confinement for aiding Sara's escape, since he told the warden to shut off the fire alarms.Mahone finally gives Sara the paper and the DVD which Michael left for her. The paper reveals a medical exam which Michael recently underwent, revealing that his brain tumor had returned, and that his condition was terminal. Finally, Lincoln and Sara sit in a boat, and view the DVD. It is a prerecorded message in which Michael explains his motivation for sacrificing himself, tells Sara and Lincoln that he loves them, and asks them to watch over each other. The video, and the entire series, culminates in Michael's final proclamation: that they are all, finally, \"free.\" [D-Man2010]The series may be over, but theres more story to tell.
