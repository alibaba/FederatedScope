The thing that made Windows great is it use to give you maximum freedom and choices. It gave you control and flexibility over your equipment. It was easy to use, and easy to figure out.<br /><br />Maybe Win 8 is easy too, but it is so different that you can't find your way around by using what you already know about Win7. You have to learn everything all over again. WASTE OF TIME!<br /><br />I do not reward stupidity, do you hear that Microsoft!

Busy with the combination of school finals and traveling, I tried contacting the seller, ELECTRONIC777 in June (before our 1 yr. exp. date) and they said there was nothing they could do and to go to Dell directly. I contacted Dell, went through diagnostic testing, they confirmed there may be a faulty part, but could not advice me any further since the 1 yr warranty on the laptop expired in Jan 2013, because that was the purchase date they had on record.  They recommended I contact the seller since the seller should be obligated to honor the 1 yr. warranty I had understood it to have.  I contacted ELECTRONIC777 and they basically verified I was suppose to have a 1 yr. warranty, but it was Dell's responsibility and were ABSOLUTELY no help, in fact instead of helping me as one of their customers, it felt like they were basically giving me the finger and saying it's your problem.  I tried contacting Amazon, thinking they would step in on my behalf having records of my purchase date and the fact that I was indeed suppose to have a 1 yr. warranty.  I filled out all the requested information and they sent me an email saying it did not fall into the A-Z Guarantee.  Ok, glad they're there to protect their consumers, shame on you amazon.  So here I am with a laptop that is barely a year old does not work for more than 20 min without crashing, a seller who won't help me, and a 1 yr. warranty that was only honored for 7 months.
