Instead  it provides important relief to those who have been penalized for choosing not to buy unaffordable insurance.\"\n\"Repealing the individual mandate simply restores to people the freedom to choose \"  she  continued. \"Nothing else about the structure of the ACA would be changed. If you currently get tax credits to help pay for your insurance  you could still receive those credits if you choose to buy an exchange plan.

The records show his company has received $27.6 million in annual payments since 2005 for land left fallow.\n Fisher  and other board members say they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had no conflicts of interest in these decisions  and their attorney has backed them up. They say the fact that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve benefited from the program is the nature of their agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s structure as a landowner-voting district. All of the board members are landowners  and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re elected by landowners under a voting system in which the largest property owners can cast the largest numbers of votes.\n Fisher  was a leading proponent of the agreement in the early 2000s.  He  said  he  supported it because  he  strongly believed it was in the best long-term interests of landowners and the community.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe financial interests of the board were the same as the financial interests of our electorate \u00e2\u0080\u009d  Fisher  said.  He  recalled that Palo Verde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attorney advised the board ahead of the vote that they were fine to proceed with the decision.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no conflict at PVID at all  because of how we are constituted \u00e2\u0080\u009d  Fisher  said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur electorate is whom we serve  and our electorate are landowners.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nStanding beside hay bales on his farm  Palo Verde Irrigation District board member Bart Fisher talks about the agency's lawsuit against the Metropolitan Water District. (Photo: Jay Calderon/The Desert Sun)\nWhen they negotiated the terms of the deal   Fisher  said  the overarching purpose was helping California meet its water needs \u00e2\u0080\u009cwithout diminishing agriculture or our community in the process.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have a vested interest and so do all the landowners in Palo Verde  especially those who participate in the program \u00e2\u0080\u009d  Fisher  said.\nParticipating farmers received an initial signup bonus of $3 170 per acre. In  Fisher \u00e2\u0080\u0099s case  the records show  his family entities received $6.3 million in initial signup payments.\nHaving those regular payments can function as a \u00e2\u0080\u009csafety net\u00e2\u0080\u009d for farming businesses during hard times and can provide a guarantee to help in getting credit from banks   Fisher  said. That doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean it always pays more than farming  though. Looking back at some years   Fisher  said  farmers would have earned more selling crops than having unplanted fields.\n Fisher  is a third-generation farmer whose family started farming in the Palo Verde Valley in 1917.

And how can I do this better ?' \" Before you know it   the short - term memory of the horrible discomfort of that moment disappears . And you get ready for another one .\" Indeed   that thinking propelled the four alumni runners interviewed for this story to sign up for the second race after trying the initial one Sept . 25   1977   running mostly out of curiosity and novelty . \" About halfway through the first race   I landed wrong on my knee and had this shooting pain  \" Mueller said . \" I got through it and said   ' Well   I ' ve got to learn how to do this .' That was the hook from there : ' I ' m going to get it right .'\" But there ' s a funny thing about running 26 . 2 miles : It ' s tough to perfect .

( Chris Walker / Chicago Tribune ) ( Chris Walker / Chicago Tribune ) From the 1977 race to 1978   Burt thought he had mastered the training process . Then he started at too brisk a pace and developed agonizing stomach cramps . \" As I was throwing up in a trash can at the end   I said   ' I ' ll never run one of these again as long as I live  '\" Burt said . \" And that was a long time ago .\" Thirty - nine years   to be exact . But running through the sights and sounds of Chicago can be an intoxicating experience   particularly when the intrigue inherent in any marathon \u2014 with its supreme mental and physical challenges \u2014 is added . The competitive element doesn ' t hurt either . An intriguing mix of competition and camaraderie has developed among the six runners   particularly since executive race director Carey Pinkowski began incorporating them into the race ' s fabric . Their entry fee is waived . They ' re invited to the introductory and elite runners ' news conferences . They start in the first wave of runners shortly after the elite athletes and fuel up in VIP tents afterward . \" I remember one year I caught up with one of the alumni runners at about Mile 18   and suddenly I started taking off like a flash  \" Mueller said . \" And my friend said   ' What are you doing ?' I said   ' I don ' t want him to catch me .' \" But last year   one of the guys ( Andrew Praxmarer ) didn ' t make it to the finish . You don ' t take any joy in one of the guys not making it .

Last year   he missed his target time of 6 hours by 10 minutes . \" I would ' ve been under 6 hours   but I tripped over a manhole cover at Mile 13 and did a face - plant and had a bloody nose  \" Williams said . \" I had to spend 13 minutes in the first - aid tent . They wouldn ' t let me go out until they could see I could run without falling .\" Such defiance and determination defines many of the runners ' races .

And when you have a 39 - year association with the race \u2014 loss of sponsorship forced the 1987 event to be shortened to a half - marathon \u2014 things happen . Just last year   Moon slipped on some ice in February   landed on the edge of a marble planter on the sidewalk and fractured two ribs and injured his hip . For two weeks   he used a walker to get from his apartment to a waiting taxi to go to physical therapy a mere two blocks away . \" I did everything they told me  \" Moon said . \" I stretched for an hour before going there . After two weeks   I was able to walk over there . After four weeks   I didn ' t need the walker anymore and went to a cane . After two months   I ' d walk two to three miles and then do my physical therapy . \" I ended up with only July   August and September to train for the marathon . I was just about the last one . They were rolling up the sidewalks and street cleaners were right behind me .\" But Moon   whose fastest time of 3 : 15 came in 1995   finished . In 2007   Mueller also slipped on some ice in February and fractured his fibula and dislocated his ankle . \" I got dragged over to the hospital and they said I needed a plate in there  \" Mueller said . \" I went to the orthopedic surgeon with my wife and said   ' Can I get this surgery done today ? Because I ' ve got to run the Chicago Marathon in October .' Of course I got quite the look for that .\" Nevertheless   Mueller finished that race in about 4 : 30 at age 60 . And that ' s the year only 25   544 of the race ' s 36   867 participants finished because officials cut short the event due to oppressive heat . \" I got past the point they stopped the race at Halsted and Adams  \" Burt said . \" I was in Chinatown when I heard on the loudspeakers that race officials had called the race and instructed runners past the cutoff point to walk to the finish line . That ' s my slowest marathon   5 : 10 . In hindsight   I wished I had continued to run a little bit more so I could ' ve beat 5 hours at least .\" Given the time commitment involved in training   there ' s a fine line between selfishness and selflessness that most runners have to navigate . To combat that   Williams began raising money for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society in 1998 . In close to two decades   Williams said he has raised $ 273   000   an effort that began in grassroots fashion with him mailing 200 letters from his dining room table .", "output": "Remarkable tales of endurance: 6 runners who finished every Chicago Marathon", "category": "Title Generation 1046.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, generate a short title of the document.

Part of the problem is that Dick\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work has been adapted for film so many times already that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to watch a given episode of Electric Dreams  however well executed  and not compare it unfavorably  if unfairly  with Blade Runner  or Paul Verhoeven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Total Recall  or Steven Spielberg \u00e2\u0080\u0099s  Minority Report.  Dick\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  sensibility is idiosyncratic and sui generis  but at this point it feels more like a piece of intellectual property than the amphetamine-fueled gnostic vision it once was. Is anybody \u00e2\u0080\u0099s  mind really blown by the is-our-world-real-or-just-a-simulation conundrum posed by \u00e2\u0080\u009cReal Life \u00e2\u0080\u009d for example  after we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen not only Total Recall but The Matrix and Westworld and a hundred other iterations of it?\nThe problem  however  isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just overfamiliarity. Dystopias draw their power from an analysis of the present  and  Dick \u00e2\u0080\u0099s once-radical vision of the future is now as far in the past as H.G. Wells\u00e2\u0080\u0099s was for  Dick  when  he  began writing. This is what Black Mirror  for all its flaws  has over Electric Dreams: The series feels like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about things that Brooker is genuinely worried about  not a dutiful tribute to what someone was worried about in the 1960s; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the future as seen from the 21st century  not the 20th. This problem is endemic to many of the recent dystopian shows. The fact that Westworld is based on a movie from 1973  and The Handmaid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tale on a novel from 1985  doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t invalidate their value as entertainments or as cultural commentaries. But it does introduce concerns alien to the dystopia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s imperative to take the worst of the present day and amplify it.", "output": "TV\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Dystopia Boom", "category": "Title Generation 1046.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, generate a short title of the document.

The tie-up hasn't hurt  Tesla  in 2017 as the company's stock has surged above $300 per share and the combined enterprise hit a market capitalization of over $50 billion.\nThat doesn't mean it wasn't a terrible deal.  Tesla's balance sheet  instantly became loaded up with SolarCity debt  and what had been primarily a carmaker was suddenly responsible for rolling out a new solar roof product  at a time when  it  should have been all-hands-on-deck to launch the Model 3 mass-market vehicle.\nThe Model 3 is woefully behind schedule at this point  and although the solar roof is compelling  The Solar City side of  Tesla  business isn't any more coherent than it was a year ago.\nMusk is also CEO of SpaceX  and last week Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas teased a merger with  Tesla   arguing that such a deal would yield powerful synergies. The financial mechanics of how a  SpaceX-Tesla  merger would happen are both speculative and unclear; in July  SpaceX raised $350 million  bringing it valuation to $21 billion. An IPO has long been discussed.\nBut maybe Musk doesn't want to be running another public company. He's expressed some exasperation with playing that role at  Tesla   where investors have the carmaker under constant scrutiny and short sellers are always circling like sharks. SpaceX's mission is ultimately more ambitious than Tesla's \u2014 the whole go-to-Mars thing \u2014 and the company have been wowing the the space community by routinely launching and landing rockets.\n Tesla  doesn't have enough cash to buy SpaceX outright  so investors would have to accept a largely stock-based deal  and that might make sense to many of them: since  its  own 2010 IPO   Tesla  shares have returned over 1 ooo%  and several analysts have said that the stock hundreds of dollars of upside potential from  its  current level.\nUnfortunately  a Tesla-SpaceX merger would raise a major issue: unlike SolarCity  the company wouldn't be shifting a massive amount of debt to  Tesla 's balance sheet  but it would be shifting monumental risk. Space is dauntingly expensive when everything is going right but ruinously costly when things go wrong. That's why governments  for the most part  have been the only ones aiming for large-scale goals in the final frontier.  Tesla-SpaceX  would expose  Tesla  to colossal losses at a time when  it 's already posting record negative earnings.\nOn the positive side   Tesla  would have access to  SpaceX 's goodwill with investors and  the company 's cash  around $1 billion. Nevertheless   Tesla  balance sheet would become almost incomprehensible  as auto  energy  and aerospace analysts all struggle to figure out what the diverse conglomerate \u2014 with a theoretical $70-billion market cap \u2014 is worth. It's already a challenge to independently value the car  energy  and solar businesses (the default position is to kick solar and energy down the road and rightly ascribe almost all of  Tesla 's value to cars).\nIf  Tesla  gains from a SpaceX merger   it  could be the deal of the decade. SpaceX investors would potentially receive a much fatter payout (if they think  Tesla  has tremendous long-terms prospects)  and Musk would be able to neatly avoid the pressure to handle two rounds of quarterly financial reporting and a whole new batch of prognosticators and short-sellers.\nOn the other hand  merging with SpaceX could yield almost zero synergies \u2014 the car business and the aerospace industry might look similar but they're actually radically different \u2014 and add so much risk and volatility to  Tesla  already risky and volatile business that  Tesla  shares could get hammered and  the company  would see  its  access to capital reduced at precisely the wrong time.\nIf I were betting  I'd say that  Tesla  and SpaceX actually will merge  perhaps against some heavy SpaceX investors complaints.  Tesla  got away with  it  on SolarCity  Musk detests being the CEO of a public company  and SpaceX is really his baby. And  Tesla  stock has become a super currency  opening up all manner of financial options.\nFinally  the long stock-market rally that we've experienced in the aftermath of the financial crisis can last forever.  Tesla  got in early and has benefitted enormously. SpaceX might not be so lucky. The biggest risk to  the company  might be that despite its triumphs  it would be out there by itself nad subject to market forces that have nothing to do with its mission.\nA merger with  Tesla  would save Musk from having to pull a SolarCity  Part Deux  and ride to rescue if SpaceX gets in trouble.\nGet the latest  Tesla  stock price here.", "output": "A Tesla", "category": "Title Generation 1046.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, generate a short title of the document.

(And taking gold in the GS  for those keeping track.)

Cincinnati has lost at least 90 games each of the past three years as part of a designed rebuild  but the front office has expressed optimism about improvement in 2018.\n Votto  has voiced patience with the rebuild in the past  but Sunday signaled a more urgent desire to start the clock on winning.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re starting to get to the point where people are starting to get tired of this stretch of ball \u00e2\u0080\u009d  Votto  said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think something needs to start changing and start going in a different direction. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to do my part to help make that change.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nBarring any stunning spring training additions  that change will have to be engineered by the same players the Reds had a year ago. Cincinnati made a couple of small signings to bolster the bullpen  but mostly is counting upon in-house improvement and good health. Not that  Votto  is so much opposed to such a tack.\nWhile the Milwaukee Brewers surprised a year ago and then splurged this winter to add Lorenzo Cain and Christian Yelich   Votto  said the Reds were right to play it safe.  He  used former Reds shortstop Zack Cozart as an example.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think at some point we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do something similar to that \u00e2\u0080\u009d  Votto  said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t speak for the business side of things  but everything they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever said is  \u00e2\u0080\u0098We have the money and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make that sort of thing happen.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nStill   Votto  wants to see the type of internal improvement that validates the rebuild.  He  doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be on a surprise team \u00e2\u0080\u0093 \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if some of the teams that surprised last year  and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to name any teams  if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really  really confident \u00e2\u0080\u009d  he  said \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but wants to be on a team that just plain knows it will win.\n He  sees that when  he  looks at the Houston Astros or the Chicago Cubs or the Washington Nationals  all teams benefiting from a few down years and the high draft picks that accompany them.

Smith\u2019s  emotive voice can be a real asset  somewhat flexibly conveying feeling.\nThe hit \u201cToo Good at Goodbyes\u201d and the second track \u201cSay it First\u201d seem to indicate that  Smith  is setting out to be a male counterpart to Adele.  His  voice is dynamic in the way it bends. While  his  singing is not as boomingly confident as Adele\u2019s   his  voice is able to zig and zag  even as it maneuvers into an occasionally whisper-y falsetto.\nIn addition to aiming for Adele\u2019s turf   Smith  is going for a classic R&B and gospel vibe. That can be heard on both \u201cOne Last Song\u201d and \u201cMidnight Train \u201d the latter of which sounds like a soulful answer to Radiohead\u2019s \u201cCreep.\u201d\n Smith  gets more righteous on \u201cHIM\u201d and gets softly groovy on \u201cBaby  You Make Me Crazy.\u201d Sometimes  Smith \u2019s higher register can be a tad grating. However   he  can somehow slightly irritate and entertain simultaneously.  He  duets successfully with up-and-coming singer Yebba on \u201cNo Peace \u201d and hits a sweet spot with the slow-burning \u201cPalace.\u201d\nThis record feels more lived-in and fully realized than  his  debut. Each of the songs on its own is decent  but you get the feeling once you finish with the closer (and second single) \u201cPray \u201d that  Smith  is taking the easy route.  He  should stretch beyond the ballads  as  he 's capable of more. This feels like a sequel to  his  first record almost in a retreading kind of way.\n\u201cThe Thrill of it All \u201d while a fitting showcase for  Smith\u2019s  skill  lacks an extra spark. It\u2019s good  but it could be better.\n\u201cToo Good at Goodbyes\u201d  Smith \u2019s songs often seem at first a tad innocuous but on repeat listens they begin to pack power. This one is a real winner.\n\u201cMidnight Train\u201d Radiohead comparisons aside  this song has some real momentum  showcasing  Smith  at  his  most vocally butter-soaked. The doo-wop style backing vocals are also a nice touch.\n\u201cBaby You Make Me Crazy\u201d This has some potent swagger. This song\u2019s little boost makes you wonder what  Smith  would do if  he  was pushed a notch or two further.", "output": "Sam Smith's ' The Thrill of It All' shows he may be Adele's male counterpart", "category": "Title Generation 1046.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, generate a short title of the document.

We finally got back to Negan  Father Gabriel and their unintended cohabitation in a trailer besieged by walkers.\nMeantime  Rick and Daryl were on the road  and  as eventually happens with most people who travel together  there was a disagreement. Plus a chokehold. Plus an explosion. Between these two and Negan and  Gabriel   it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obviously so hard for men to truly be friends.\nSo what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to happen inside the Sanctuary? Will Rick and Daryl patch it up? Is it possible that  Gabriel  just has the flu?\n3. Negan and Gabriel: They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re no Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy.

So while the latter tried to figure a way out  or wait for his compadres to come try to rescue them   Gabriel  just kept gnawing on the confession bone.\nFinally as the zombies were starting to punch through the side of their makeshift fort   Gabriel  confessed to Negan that  he  had locked  his  parishioners outside the church when the plague came and listened to them die.\nNegan responded sort of like an actual human. He told  Gabriel  of cheating on  his  first wife before the disease came and then not being able to \u00e2\u0080\u009cput her down\u00e2\u0080\u009d when she died amid the plague.

These are significant in a couple of ways: first  the release of these e-mails can fairly be seen as a counterstroke against the president* and his congressional dogsled team  and second  they give a pretty good look at the kind of chaos that Comey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s firing occasioned in the Bureau\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rank and file.\nWhen President Trump fired  James Comey  as FBI director last May  the special agent in charge of the Detroit field office  David Gelios  wrote an email to  his  staff: \u00e2\u0080\u009c I just saw CNN reporting that  Director Comey  has been fired by President Trump. I have no notification from HQ of any such thing. If I receive any information from HQ  I will advise. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d ask all to stand by for clarification of this reporting. I am only sending this because I want everyone to know I have received no HQ confirmation of the reporting. I hope this is an instance of fake news.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nOh  and the e-mails also provide further evidence that Sarah Huckabee Sanders is an utterly truthless drone whose daily briefings are unworthy of serious attention. At the time  Comey  was fired  the White House line  peddled by SarahHuck and by the vulgar talking yam for whom she works  was that agents in the Bureau had \u00e2\u0080\u009clost confidence\u00e2\u0080\u009d in Comey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leadership. (At the time  the president*  of course  would undercut his own outrageous lie by telling Lester Holt that he canned  Comey  over the Russia thing.) These e-mails show a sense of outrage among the grunts in the field offices on whose behalf Sanders and Trump presumed to speak.\nAfter the president fired Comey there was some uncertainty about whether Comey  as a former FBI employee  would have to pay his way home from LAX or would be able to use the director\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plane. NBC recently reported that an irate Trump called McCabe a day after the firing asking why  Comey  had been permitted to return to Washington on an FBI plane. McCabe indicated that he hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been consulted about the use of the plane but  had anyone asked  he would have approved the request. Thanks to one of these emails  we now have a small window into what went on at the FBI at the time. On May 11  Gregory Cox  assistant director of the Critical Incident Response Group  emailed all of the Critical Incident Response Group thanking \u00e2\u0080\u009call who were involved in efforts to bring home former Director Comey from Los Angeles on Tuesday evening.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The apparent defiance may be subtle  but it is unmistakable. Cox may not have known that his email dealt with a point the president had personally raised with the acting director  but he thanked his people for doing the right thing by  Comey  irrespective of politics  he  was surely aware of in a generic sense.\nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t minimize how thoroughly  Comey  bungled at the end of the 2016 presidential campaign. If what  he \u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing now is atonement  that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only right.  He  has a lot for which  he  should atone. But the sense of dislocation in these e-mails shows where the current propaganda war against the FBI first took root. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where the water first went muddy.", "output": "Donald Trump's Comey Problem", "category": "Title Generation 1046.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, generate a short title of the document.

Ad Policy The Amazon founder \u2019 s geeky obsession with numbers evidently formed early   and despite the glimmer of discomfort revealed by his Princeton anecdote   his fervently quantitative take on the world clearly still predominates . In a letter accompanying the 2009 Amazon annual report   for instance   he sets out a mind - boggling 452 goals for the company in the coming year . The word \" revenue \" is mentioned only eight times   yet revenue growth is central to the Amazon story . Expanding both internationally and across other products \u2014 nonbook sales represent 75 percent of total Amazon turnover \u2014 Amazon \u2019 s global business has increased fifteenfold over the past decade   28 percent last year alone . Sales in 2009 topped $ 24 . 5 billion . To put that in perspective   in 2008 total sales by all US bookstores were less than $ 17 billion .

But dig beneath the surface of the numbers and a more complex picture emerges   one suggesting that   stats notwithstanding   readers and writers may ultimately not be best served by Amazon \u2019 s race to become the biggest   cheapest and most convenient bookseller around . Amazon has not grown to where it is today by being touchy - feely . Sure   it adopted the informal trappings that characterized many of the new technology start - ups of the 1990s . But if  Bezos \u2019 s  first desk at  the company  was an old door on trestles   the business conducted from behind it has been as ruthless as anything  he  encountered in  his  previous gig as a Wall Street broker . Soon after Amazon \u2019 s launch in 1995    Bezos  told  his  employees that  he  wanted a place that was both \" intense and friendly \" but that \" if you ever had to give up \u2018 friendly \u2019 in order to have \u2018 intense  \u2019 we would do that .\"", "output": "The Trouble With Amazon", "category": "Title Generation 1046.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, generate a short title of the document.

(Julie Jacobson/Associated Press)\nNEW YORK \u2014  Mikal Bridges  was not even a top 80 recruit coming out of  his  suburban Philadelphia high school in 2014. In the one-and-done era of college basketball   he  was the opposite when  he  arrived at Villanova that summer and was forced to redshirt  his  freshman season because  he  simply wasn\u2019t ready. When  he  was finally prepared to play as a relatively unknown reserve on the Wildcats\u2019 national championship team the following season   his  older teammates chided  him  for  his  finesse tendencies in the lane.  He  preferred layups over powerful dunks.\nPray for the Gonzaga basketball team Nothings wrong with them  it\u2019s just that  Mikal Bridges  just ended  their  program pic.twitter.com/ywUj8Hhirx \u2014 Stri:(a (@StrikaNation24_) December 6  2017\nMore people stood after the sequence  and a large group of fans started chanting \u201cMi-kal Bri-dges\u201d briefly at one end of the arena. It ended after a few seconds  but what  Bridges  did Tuesday night \u2014 scoring a career-high 28 points to go along with six rebounds and two blocks \u2014 will likely reverberate across college basketball for some time. ESPN analyst Jay Bilas said on the game\u2019s telecast that  Bridges  had made a \u201ccase for first-team all-American.\u201d On Twitter  former Villanova guard Josh Hart claimed his former teammate would be a first-round pick  and some even boldly projected that  Bridges  would be drafted ahead of Michigan State star Miles Bridges.\nThat wave of noise didn\u2019t seem to faze the soft-spoken Mikal Bridges as he took the podium afterward  where he said all the right things and told the story about the older veterans in the program who have challenged him to attack more over the years. One of the primary concerns for Villanova entering the season was finding a replacement for the graduated Hart and Kris Jenkins  who were pillars in the program for four seasons. Villanova has another experienced star in 6-2 junior point guard Jalen Brunson  who finished with 12 points Tuesday  as well as redshirt junior Phil Booth  a Baltimore product who scored 20 points on 9-for-14 shooting as Gonzaga turned in one of its worst defensive performances of the past two years.", "output": "Villanova's Mikal Bridges entertains in win over Gonzaga", "category": "Title Generation 1046.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, generate a short title of the document.

Independence Day used the Roswell incident of 1947 as a key plot point  and Men in Black suggested constant alien cover-ups  while a supposed alien autopsy aired in prime time. It was hip and cool to know the various plots associated with \"the grays \" and when the Lindsay Lohan vehicle I Know Who Killed Me cast radio show host Art Bell (of the conspiracy-themed Coast to Coast show) as himself  it played like an attempt at an in-joke for cool kids. These days  however  the most prominent talker about aliens and secret plots is no longer Bell  who kept things relatively apolitical on-air and is a centrist Libertarian. It's now  Alex Jones   a Trump supporter and peddler of doomsday supply wares.  Jones   whose conspiracy-mongering actually prompted NASA to deny  they  were hiding child slaves on Mars  is also known for more politically targeted rants  like the government turning children gay  Barack Obama being the head of ISIS  and the Sandy Hook massacre being faked to help facilitate a government gun grab.\n Jones  and  his  contributors also have issues with \"anti-white racism \" all while a separate school of thought has emerged that tales of ancient aliens are racist  as they assume ancient civilizations of color like the Egyptians could only have come up with the pyramids and such by getting outside help from a more advanced race. Throw into that mix the \"birther\" theories that were all the rage during the Obama presidency -- promoted by our current president -- that the chief executive was some kind of secret Kenyan Muslim usurper  and you start to get a picture of what conspiracy theorists look like in today's media. Being into aliens and cover-ups is less associated now with young and sexy TV stars  and more the domain of aggrieved middle-aged men.\nX-Files creator Chris Carter is clearly having none of that  though given the overall storylines of the show  he seems at the very least to be inspired by a favorite left-wing conspiracy notion of contaminated vaccines. A montage of the achievements of archvillain Carl \"Cigarette-Smoking Man\" Busch includes a whole lot of Donald Trump and Steve Bannon (masterful timing  it turned out  as the spat between those two was making headlines almost simultaneously)  as well as a line about how people are easier to fool now because they don't believe in science (cough... GlobalWarming... cough cough) and don't know what fake news is. Meanwhile  our heroes remain FBI agents  who  in the minds of  Alex Jones  devotees  would be considered part of the anti-Trump \"Deep State.\"  Jones  was arguably an inspiration for Joel McHale's YouTube host character in season 10  and written semi-sympathetically...but that was January of 2016  when nobody assumed the election would go the way it did  or that  Jones  would get a big thumbs-up from candidate Trump.\nIn an episode that also definitively stated the moon landing was faked and that Busch is definitely the father of two very significant characters  we also caught hints of two different conspiracies at war with one another. Their most obvious point of disagreement on the show is whether Dana Scully should live or die -- but in real life they may be representative of the Art Bell and  Alex Jones  wings of Conspiracystan. We get a strong sense of what side Carter is on...but the low ratings suggest that those who pore over cover-ups and aliens nowadays may no longer feel politically simpatico with the creator.\nOr  perhaps  they can just go to any corner of the Internet and find similarly intricate stories  many of which are shared as memes on Facebook by that uncle who turns out to have been a lot crazier than you ever suspected. Even as  Jones  semi-admitted in court that he's playing a character akin to  of all things  Jack Nicholson's Joker  I've seen family members share his stories about a coming race war with utter seriousness.

This month we hear something is good  and next we almost expect to hear it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bad. Why not assume the latest research will all eventually be nullified  and just close our eyes and eat whatever tastes best? That notion is at once relatable and tragic  in that diet is inextricable from the amount of healthy time we spend on Earth. Improvements in diet are clearly associated with significant lengthening of lifespan and dramatic decreases in risk of most chronic diseases. Combining disease and longevity into the concept of healthspan  the number of healthy years of life\u00e2\u0080\u0094fundamentally more important but less readily quantifiable than lifespan\u00e2\u0080\u0094the data in favor of optimizing our diets are even more compelling. No one is arguing that diet is less than extremely important to health and well-being  but seemingly everyone is arguing as to what constitutes the best diet. \"A diet of minimally processed foods close to nature  predominantly plants  is decisively associated with health promotion and disease prevention.\" The voices that carry the farthest over the sea of diet recommendations are those of iconoclasts\u00e2\u0080\u0094those who promise the most for the least  and do so with certainty. Amid the clamor   Dr. David Katz  is emerging as an iconoclast on the side of reason. At least  that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how  he  describes  himself . From  his  throne at Yale University's Prevention Research Center  where  he  is a practicing physician and researcher  said sea of popular diet media is the institution against which  he  rebels. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that nutrition science is corrupt  just that the empty promises of memetic  of-the-moment diet crazes are themselves junk food. To  Katz   they  are more than annoying and confusing;  they  are dangerous injustice. Scientific publisher Annual Reviews asked  Katz  to compare the medical evidence for and against every mainstream diet.  He  says they came to  him  because of  his  penchant for dispassionate appraisals. \"I don't have a dog in the fight \"  he  told me. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care which diet is best. I care about the truth.\"\n Katz  and Yale colleague Stephanie Meller published their findings in the current issue of the journal in a paper titled  \"Can We Say What Diet Is Best for Health?\" In it  they compare the major diets of the day: Low carb  low fat  low glycemic  Mediterranean  mixed/balanced (DASH)  Paleolithic  vegan  and elements of other diets. Despite the pervasiveness of these diets in culture and media  Katz and Meller write  \"There have been no rigorous  long-term studies comparing contenders for best diet laurels using methodology that precludes bias and confounding. For many reasons  such studies are unlikely.\" They conclude that no diet is clearly best  but there are common elements across eating patterns that are proven to be beneficial to health. \"A diet of minimally processed foods close to nature  predominantly plants  is decisively associated with health promotion and disease prevention.\" Katz  Meller/Annual Reviews Among the salient points of proven health benefits the researchers note  nutritionally-replete plant-based diets are supported by a wide array of favorable health outcomes  including fewer cancers and less heart disease. These diets ideally included not just fruits and vegetables  but whole grains  nuts  and seeds. Katz and Meller found \"no decisive evidence\" that low-fat diets are better than diets high in healthful fats  like the Mediterranean. Those fats include a lower ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids than the typical American diet.\nThe Mediterranean diet  which is additionally defined by high intake of fiber  moderate alcohol and meat intake  antioxidants  and polyphenols  does have favorable effects on heart disease  cancer risk  obesity  metabolic syndrome  and \"is potentially associated with defense against neurodegenerative disease and preservation of cognitive function  reduced inflammation  and defense against asthma.\" They also found carbohydrate-selective diets to be better than categorically low-carbohydrate diets  in that incorporating whole grains is associated with lower risks for cancers and better control of body weight. Attention to glycemic load and index is \"sensible at the least.\" Eating foods that have high glycemic loads (which  Katz  says is much more relevant to health outcomes than glycemic index\u00e2\u0080\u0094in that some quality foods like carrots have very high indices  which could be misleading) is associated with greater risk of heart disease. Finally  in a notable blow to some interpretations of the Paleo diet   Katz  and Meller wrote  \"if Paleolithic eating is loosely interpreted to mean a diet based mostly on meat  no meaningful interpretation of health effects is possible.\" They note that the composition of most meat in today's food supply is not similar to that of mammoth meat  and that most plants available during the Stone Age are today extinct.

Cloying incense mixed with smoke from Edmonds\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cigarettes  which  he  chain-smoked; talking about what had changed since the shooting made  him  feel stressed.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's like a prison in here.

He  lost the ability to bathe or dress on  his  own. While living in  his  cousin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house   he  rarely left except for doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appointments  and then  he  needed two or three people to bump  him  in  his  wheelchair down the front steps. To get something from  his  old room   his  cousin would have to FaceTime  him  from the third floor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBeing dependent on so many people  I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the hardest thing \u00e2\u0080\u009d  he  said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWithout my family  my sister  seeing my children  I really might have given up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nLast spring  a former roommate saw  Edmonds  struggling and encouraged  him  to restart the victim compensation process. They filled out the application together and enlisted the help of a local lawyer. Still  there were roadblocks \u00e2\u0080\u0094  Edmonds  could not easily go down to the police department to get the incident report  so  he  had to wait months for the detective to bring it to  him . At one point someone stole his phone and he lost all his contacts  including the number for the lawyer.\nDecember marked the two-year anniversary of  his  shooting. That month  he  moved to  his  mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apartment  where there are no steps to get in the front door.  He  can move around more easily there  but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still hard to take a shower on  his  own; the counters and cabinets are not built for someone in a wheelchair. On Christmas Day   he  stayed home and watched basketball while  his  family celebrated at  his  grandmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house. Afterward   his  sister brought  him  a plate of food.\nAs of this article\u00e2\u0080\u0099s publication   his  application had not yet been submitted.", "output": "States Set Aside Millions Of Dollars For Crime Victims.

When  Botticelli  was a deputy within the office  Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) introduced legislation to remove the by-then-controversial language on marijuana. The bill went nowhere.  Botticelli  struggled even to answer questions on the subject.\nOperating within these political and legal constraints   Botticelli  and others adopted more nuanced approaches to their work. The office pushed to obtain more federal funding for treatment. It supported states that sought to route those addicted to illegal substances like opioids away from the criminal justice system and into treatment.  Botticelli  supported the Justice Department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to shed the more onerous drug war era initiatives such as requiring mandatory minimum sentences for even low-level drug possession.\nLater in that interview   Botticelli  was asked about legalizing marijuana  not just decriminalizing penalties for its use.  He  said  he  was against states\u00e2\u0080\u0099 commercializing the drug. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt becomes an addiction to  unfortunately  a tax revenue that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s often based on bad public health policy \u00e2\u0080\u009d  he  said.

Had they done so  they would have incurred blowback from both parties in Congress and alienated drug prevention advocates who oppose marijuana use. More importantly  the controversy would likely have distracted from the more critical opioid epidemic.

Flannery 's dividend cut marks the second big surprise since  he  took the reins of the $177 billion market capitalization company this summer  replacing Jeff Immelt. Weeks into  Flannery 's tenure   he  slashed GE's earnings outlook. Shares of GE have been falling since  hitting new post-crisis lows of $19 in Monday trading.\nGE's dividend is prized among its shareholders  particularly retail investors and retirees who've owned the stock for decades. Former CEO Immelt characterized his decision to cut the company's dividend during the dark days of the crisis - when GE was teetering on collapse - as the worst moment of his career. It appears to be an equally brutal event for  Flannery .\nAbout the move   Flannery  said the following to investors: \"We understand the importance of this decision to our shareowners and we have not made it lightly. We are focused on driving total shareholder return and believe this is the right decision to align our dividend payout to cash flow generation.\"\nSince becoming GE's leader   Flannery  has projected a style of accountability where  he  will be reviewing all businesses and making tough decisions when change is deemed necessary. The company's unrealistic earning guidance and its outstretched dividend are now gone; soon  Flannery  may wield a scalpel to underperforming divisions  or those that fit better in the portfolio of a private equity buyer.\nOn a conference call with investors on Monday   Flannery  vowed  he  and 1 000 executives will stop receiving long-term bonuses. But fanned more worry by offering 2018 earnings guidance of just $1-to-$1.07 a share and organic revenue growth of zero to 3%. Margins are only expected to improve as much as 40 basis points in 2018.\nIt is likely  Flannery  will try to refocus in areas where the company has a market leading footprint  for instance aviation  healthcare and renewable energy equipment. Aviation and healthcare are likely to be GE's fastest growing businesses best businesses such as renewable energy and aviation could grow their top and bottom likes by double digits and healthcare in the mid single digits.

Embiid  averaged 20 points on 46% shooting  36% from downtown  with nearly eight rebounds and 2.5 blocks per game. With Embiid on the floor  the lowly 76ers actually outscored teams  competing with opponents for the first time in years after undergoing a dramatic rebuild.\nThe Sixers know what they have in  Embiid  on the floor \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an athletic  inside-out  physical specimen capable of defending the rim and taking over the game on offense. The question is how often they'll get to have  Embiid  on the floor.\nSixers coach Brett Brown has already said the team is being extremely cautious with  Embiid 's health. He has sat out parts of training camp this season  taking part in 5-on-5 drills only occasionally. Few believe he'll play a full  82-game season soon. ESPN's Zach Lowe estimated that in order for the 76ers to be a playoff team  they'll need at least 50 games out of  Embiid   a modest projection that is still nearly double what he played last year.\nIf  Embiid  can't get over his injury woes  the 76ers will be saddled with a long  expensive contract for a player who can't get on the floor. According to Wojnarowski  the deal contains some \"salary cap protection\" for the 76ers if  Embiid  suffers a long-term injury  though it's unclear what the guarantees and non-guarantees are at this point.\nBut when  Embiid  is healthy   he  can do things like this:\nThe 76ers have decided that however much of this they can get from  Embiid  per season is worth it.\nIf  Embiid  recovers from  his  physical ailments and can play at least over 50% of the season annually  then the deal will be worthwhile. Stocked with back-to-back No. 1 picks in Ben Simmons and Markelle Fultz  the Sixers have a core that may be the most promising in the league.\nBut until  Embiid  is healthy and stays healthy  the team will always have a big question hanging over it.", "output": "76ers' contract extension for Joel Embiid a massive gamble", "category": "Title Generation 1046.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, generate a short title of the document.

(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\nSeparated from most of his West Wing staff \u2014 who fretted over why he was late getting to the Oval Office \u2014  Trump  clicked on the television and spent the morning playing fuming media critic  legal analyst and crisis communications strategist  according to several people close to  him .\n The president  digested the news of the first indictments in special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s probe with exasperation and disgust  these people said.  He  called  his  lawyers repeatedly.  He  listened intently to cable news commentary. And  with rising irritation   he  watched live footage of  his  onetime campaign adviser and confidant  Paul Manafort  turning  himself  in to the FBI.\nInitially   Trump  felt vindicated. Though frustrated that the media were linking  him  to the indictment and tarnishing  his  presidency   he  cheered that the \u00adcharges against Manafort and  his  deputy  Rick Gates  were focused primarily on activities that began before  his  campaign.  Trump  tweeted at 10:28 a.m.  \u201cthere is NO COLLUSION!\u201d\nBut the president\u2019s celebration was short-lived. A few minutes later  court documents were unsealed showing that George Papadopoulos  an unpaid foreign policy adviser on  Trump\u2019s  campaign  pleaded guilty to making a false statement to the FBI about his efforts to broker a relationship between  Trump  and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The case provides the clearest evidence yet of links between  Trump \u2019s campaign and Russian officials.\nGeorge Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in early October to lying to federal officials about his contacts with Russian nationals. He is one of three former  Trump  campaign officials facing criminal charges. (Elyse Samuels/The Washington Post)\nFor a president who revels in chaos \u2014 and in orchestrating it himself \u2014 Monday brought a political storm that  Trump  could not control. White House chief of staff John F. Kelly  along with lawyers Ty Cobb  John Dowd and Jay Sekulow  advised  Trump  to be cautious with his public responses  but they were a private sounding board for his grievances  advisers said.\n\u201cThis has not been a cause of great agita or angst or activity at the White House \u201d said Cobb  the White House lawyer overseeing Russia matters. He added that  Trump  is \u201cspending all of his time on presidential work.\u201d\n[Three former  Trump  campaign officials charged by special counsel]\nBut  Trump \u2019s anger Monday was visible to those who interacted with  him   and the mood in the corridors of the White House was one of weariness and fear of the unknown. As the president groused upstairs  many staffers \u2014 some of whom have hired lawyers to help them navigate Mueller\u2019s investigation \u2014 privately speculated about where the special counsel might turn next.\n Trump  is also increasingly agitated by the expansion of Mueller\u2019s probe into financial issues beyond the 2016 campaign and about the potential damage to  him  and  his  family.\nThis portrait of  Trump  and  his  White House on a day of crisis is based on interviews with 20 senior administration officials   Trump  friends and key outside allies  many of whom insisted on anonymity to discuss sensitive internal matters.\nTrump and  his  aides were frustrated that  yet again  Russia steamrolled the start of a carefully planned week of policy news.  Trump  is preparing to nominate a new chairman of the Federal Reserve and is scheduled to depart Friday for a high-stakes  12-day trip across Asia  and House Republicans are planning to unveil their tax overhaul bill.\nAway from the podium   Trump  staffers fretted privately over whether Manafort or Gates might share with Mueller\u2019s team damaging information about other colleagues. They expressed concern in particular about Gates because he has a young family  may be more stretched financially than Manafort  and continued to be involved in  Trump \u2019s political operation and had access to the White House  including attending West Wing meetings after  Trump  was sworn in.\nSome White House advisers are unhappy with Thomas J. Barrack Jr.  Trump\u2019s longtime friend and chair of his inauguration  whom they hold responsible for keeping Gates in the  Trump  orbit long after Manafort resigned as campaign chairman in August 2016  according to people familiar with the situation.

The Bass Pro impresario threw a gala party and brought in fishing and hunting pals  including country music superstars  actor Kevin Costner and former Presidents Jimmy Carter and George W. Bush.

The aquarium portion of Wonders of Wildlife doesn\u2019t limit itself  for instance  to water-dwelling live animals. Owls inhabit a barn setting  and brown bears live where the pathway  briefly  ventures out of doors.

The main point is that taxes on hunting and fishing gear and licenses have funded state and federal conservation efforts to the tune of tens of billions of dollars since 1937. You can look it up by  well  looking up at one of the aquarium\u2019s walls  where  Morris  has the stats laid out.\nIt\u2019s a worthy message to deliver  especially to folks whose most vigorous hunting trips come in the aisles at Costco. But the effect in the galleries can be disquieting.  The dioramas Morris  has commissioned are  by and large  spectacular. The backdrops are hand-painted. The animals strike vivid poses: A grizzly bear chases wolves through an Alaskan tundra scene  and a herd of caribou surges uphill out of a roiling river. Some dioramas are like windows onto a specific moment; others are  again  maximalist  as in the Africa room  where visitors walk in the middle of an enormous set stuffed and mounted with virtually every animal of that continent you can think of \u2014 Africa\u2019s greatest hits.\nBut just as you are admiring the homage to the national parks in a series of dioramas showcasing marquee species from some of them  a little plaque will inform you that this particular bear standing in a stream amid salmon at Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge is  in fact  a 10-foot 6-inch brown bear taken with bow and arrow by John Paul Morris  one of  Johnny \u2019s sons  at Deadman Bay  Kodiak Island  Alaska  in October 2011.\nElsewhere  there\u2019s the \u201clongest alligator gar ever recorded \u201d an 8-foot 3 \u00be-inch specimen taken by John Paul and  Johnny  on a Texas river in 2007.

They  gave us April\u2019s number.\nApril (credit counselor): The majority of  their  debt was old and in collections  so they were really at the \u201ccleanup stage\u201d and [handling each debt] one at a time more than all together. They used a mix of different techniques to address the collections. Some needed to be disputed as already paid or invalid. They also had some that appeared to be past the statute of limitations  so they first needed to verify this with an attorney and then dispute. Others they settled on  but most they made paid in full.\n Cara :  We  kept looking each month at what  we  had and the progress  we  had made. Slowly but surely  as  we  disputed and paid down  our  debts   our  credit scores went up.\n Jesse : Same for me. I was looking forward to the future where one day   we \u2019d be able to buy things again.\nApril: When  Jesse  and Cara first came to me in 2012  their credit scores were 536 and 584  respectively.

And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got three helicopters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Corey sat there with a half smile on his face  not knowing quite how to respond.\nWhen  Donald Trump  listed the aircraft  he  had during Corey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job interview  Corey shrugged it off as a random boast. But  Trump  wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t boasting.  He  was pointing out the military equipment  he  had for the war ahead. A candidate with a jet has a formidable advantage over rivals without one. A candidate with an air force was going to be tough to beat.\nWhen you flew with  Trump   you flew first class times ten. Except  that is  when it came time to eat.\nThe first time Dave told his wife Susan that he was going to be on Trump Force One  she asked him to take some photos of what they served him to eat on the plane. She had read somewhere that  Mr. Trump  had a personal chef who traveled with  him . When dinner came on the flight  Dave pulled out his BlackBerry and snapped a picture of the bag of McDonald\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hamburgers and unopened package of Oreo cookies and emailed it to Susan.\nOn Trump Force One there were four major food groups: McDonald\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  Kentucky Fried Chicken  pizza  and Diet Coke. There were also ancillary groups  including Vienna Fingers and the ubiquitous Oreo  before the boycott (after it was Hydrox). The reason the package of Oreos was unopened was because  Mr. Trump  would never eat from a previously opened package. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen the Seinfeld episode in which George double-dips  his  chip  you have a pretty good idea of the boss\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reasoning. Packages of cookies  along with small airliner-size bags of pretzels and potato chips  filled the plane\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cupboards. An army might march on its stomach  but Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team flew on junk food. And those snacks would have to sustain us during long flights and even longer days.\nThe candidate would hardly ever eat lunch and would eat dinner only after he finished the last event of the day. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be in the jet or on the road from seven or eight a.m.  make however many scheduled stops we had  and after the last one  perhaps around nine p.m.   Mr. Trump  would clap  his  hands and say  \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d And the food needed to be hot and ready for  him . Some of the time  especially when  he  was pleased with  his  performance at a rally or event   he \u00e2\u0080\u0099d say  \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you think I deserve a malted today? I think I deserve one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Trump   a city kid  grew up drinking malteds  so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what he always called a milkshake. Whatever you want to call it  it better be there and it better still be thick.\nWhen traveling in the air with the boss  you also learned pretty quickly to like Elton John.  Donald Trump  really likes Elton John. Anthony \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Mooch\u00e2\u0080\u009d Scaramucci got in all sorts of hot water\u00e2\u0080\u0094which is not at all an unfamiliar position for him\u00e2\u0080\u0094when he told an interviewer that Elton John would play at President Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inaugural. It had been wishful thinking on Mooch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part  probably because he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been on the plane when the boss had \u00e2\u0080\u009cTiny Dancer\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cRocket Man\u00e2\u0080\u009d playing as loud as the concert-level speakers could bring it. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re telling you  when the boss cranks up Elton  you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hear yourself think.

But the government rejected allegations that  the ruling  was an attack on press freedom   with Duterte ' s spokesman saying Rappler and Rappler Holdings Corp had violated a provision in the country ' s constitution restricting media ownership to Filipinos . At his state of the nation address to Congress last year Duterte vowed to expose Rappler ' s \" American ownership .\" \" The issue at hand is the compliance of 100 percent Filipino ownership and management of mass media .

The ruling followed setbacks suffered by other Philippine news organisations which have criticized Duterte ' s war on drugs that has killed nearly 4   000 suspects .

A memo from NBC News chairman Andy Lack cited \u00e2\u0080\u009cinappropriate sexual behavior\u00e2\u0080\u009d as the grounds for termination.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOn Monday night \u00e2\u0080\u009d Lack wrote  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe received a detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace by  Matt Lauer .

As Lack himself acknowledged  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile it is the first complaint about his behavior in the over twenty years he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been at NBC News  we were also presented with reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nIn the wake of  Lauer \u00e2\u0080\u0099s unexpected departure  Today was forced to reckon with the story in real time.

One incident that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already been circulated and picked apart by social media is the Presidential Forum that  Lauer  moderated in September 2016. At the time   Lauer  was widely criticized for the way  he  interacted with candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton  with many accusing the Today host of employing a sexist double standard. In one article  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow Sexism  Like Matt Lauer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  Could Imperil the Nation \u00e2\u0080\u009d Adele M.

But when paired with Trump  it became clear who was the alpha in that set-up. It clearly wasn't  Lauer   who allowed Trump to talk over him  and to evade specifics.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nWhile  Lauer \u00e2\u0080\u0099s tendency to interrupt Clinton repeatedly\u00e2\u0080\u0094while letting Trump go largely unchallenged\u00e2\u0080\u0094was certainly cringe-worthy  it may not be Lauer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most painful on-air interaction. Anyone searching for an example of overt sexism need look no further than his 2012 Today interview with Anne Hathaway. The actress  who was promoting her film Les Miserables at the time  had had the misfortune of being photographed during a \u00e2\u0080\u009cwardrobe malfunction.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was getting out of the car and my dress was so tight that I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t realize it until I saw all the photographers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 flashes \u00e2\u0080\u009d she reportedly said in response to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cdevastating\u00e2\u0080\u009d incident. As if the revealing photographs weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enough  Hathaway was then grilled on the minor controversy by  Lauer   who opened the interview with a gross allusion to the intimate pics.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnne Hathaway  good morning  nice to see you.

You had a little wardrobe malfunction the other night. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the lesson learned from something like that  other than that you keep smiling  which you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll always do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To summarize:  Lauer   mistaking pervy paparazzi pics for actual news  asked an accomplished actress about a painful incident  phrasing the invasion of privacy as a personal failing (\u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the lesson learned from something like that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d). To make matters even worse  he all but told Hathaway to smile through it\u00e2\u0080\u0094which is just what every woman wants to hear from a man who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talking down to her about her lack of underwear on national television.\nHathaway  to her credit  managed to own  Lauer   replying  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell  it was obviously an unfortunate incident. It kind of made me sad on two accounts.

With any Kubrick work  there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a magisterial sense of control and overreach present in every frame  an approach that helped make him the (sometimes clich\u00c3\u00a9d) embodiment of the auteur filmmaker. In  Barry Lyndon   that attention to extravagant detail lies in those candles  which can make the most epic manse feel chillingly intimate.\nThe behind-the-scenes features on the Criterion Collection\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remastered release of  Barry Lyndon   out this month  make it clear just what a struggle it was to light scenes with tiny flames. Capturing even a still image with so little illumination is a challenge; using a film camera was much harder  necessitating the use of gigantic lenses developed for NASA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s moon landings.

There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good reason it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revived with some frequency at major repertory cinemas  sometimes with a live orchestra to replicate its memorable score (which consists entirely of classical pieces  especially Handel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cSarabande\u00e2\u0080\u009d from his Keyboard suite in D minor). But the Criterion effort to replicate Barry Lyndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cinematic impact is impressive. The Blu-ray has a similarly hypnotic impact at home as it does in the theater  drawing the audience\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focus to the surprising details in the background of each long  stately shot. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a movie that actually makes the past look otherworldly  unlike many period pieces  which strive to make history seem easy to slip into.\nBased on the novel The Luck of  Barry Lyndon  by William Makepeace Thackeray  Kubrick\u00e2\u0080\u0099s film chronicles the rise and fall of an opportunistic 18th-century Irishman who ascends  through a mixture of luck and ambition  to success and nobility and then experiences a similarly dramatic decline. Barry (Ryan O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Neal) is a frustrating  foolish  and often unknowable protagonist  prone to hot-headed and cowardly behavior  capable of both great empathy and callousness for those closest to him.", "output": "' Barry Lyndon' on Criterion: Stanley Kubrick's Sumptuous Masterpiece", "category": "Title Generation 1046.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, generate a short title of the document.

In November  we have the Russian Revolution and the Balfour Declaration  and this week marks the 500th year since  Martin Luther  challenged the Catholic Church with  his  95 theses. Given the loopy Zeitgeist of our times  I should rush into the street and mark the occasion by defacing Protestant churches with the customary red paint of protest. Luther  after all  was more than the creator of Protestantism. He was also a rotten anti-Semite.\nBut does  Luther  also deserve a splash of red? The evidence is pretty shocking  not to mention definitive. In 1543   he  published \u00e2\u0080\u009cOn the Jews and Their Lies \u00e2\u0080\u009d in which  he  called my ancestors \u00e2\u0080\u009cbase and whoring people\u00e2\u0080\u009d full of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cdevil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feces . . . they wallow in like swine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n He  had all sorts of ideas for what to do with the Jews  including the wholesale liquidation of their synagogues  even homes  and a ban on the teaching of their rabbis \u00e2\u0080\u009con pain of loss of life and limb.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nTo be sure  Luther\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Jew-hatred was typical for the time  but  Luther himself  was hardly typical.  He  was a powerful  colloquial writer  and  his  words surely had some effect.  He  was the founder of a church  or a movement  that now numbers nearly 1 billion.\nBut more pertinently   he  provided a religious imprimatur to German anti-Semitism  which culminated in the Holocaust.  Luther  was often cited by the Nazis  but it would be wrong to blame  him  alone for the murder of 6 million souls.\nAs far as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m concerned   Luther  is a flawed figure. I can appreciate \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even applaud \u00e2\u0080\u0094  his  reforms  but they mean little to  me . Nevertheless  I spare  him  the red paint because I know  his  Jew-hatred is hugely negligible compared with the Reformation  he  initiated and  not insignificantly  the role  he  played in encouraging literacy.  He  wrote in German  not Latin  and like the Hebrews  he  so despised   he  interposed no one between man and God. One had to read the Bible.\nI pick and choose  my symbolic can of red paint always at the ready. But when it comes to those Confederate generals  they unambiguously stand for slavery  racism and the vile nostalgia for the so-called Lost Cause that prompted the erection of so many memorials.

In fact  some might say the final score was: Decisions that blew up on Dusty Baker (2) over Decision that blew up on Joe Maddon (1).\nAsked whether he\u2019d heard Rizzo yelling  Baker said  \u201cNah  I don\u2019t care. I\u2019d have screamed  too.\u201d\nSoon  it was Baker\u2019s turn. In the seventh inning with one out  Ben Zobrist broke up what had been a marvelous  downright gallant no-hit bid by Max Scherzer  who had spent the last nine days wondering whether the next time he pitched full-bore he might blow out his tight right hamstring and be done for the year. Before this game  Scherzer said he figured he would be good for maybe 100 pitches. He was at 98.\n Baker  called for Solis. The Cubs countered with the dangerous Albert Almora Jr.  who hit .342 against southpaws this year. Almora singled home the tying run on a change-up that stayed \u2014 up.\nFinally  in the brutal eighth  in a decision and a moment that may be the most painful of the Nationals\u2019 season if they do not rebound from this deficit   Baker  decided not to intentionally walk Rizzo  the Cubs\u2019 top RBI man \u2014 by miles \u2014 and instead bring in lefty specialist Perez to cope with him. It was a journeyman-with-a-specialty against a superstar.\n Baker  had options.  He  could have walked Rizzo and let Brandon Kintzler  an all-star closer this year for the Minnesota Twins  pitch to Cubs cleanup man Willson Contreras  who is powerful but strikeout prone.  He  could even have (perhaps) overmanaged and brought in  his  best pure-stuff right-hander  Ryan Madson  to face Contreras to try to overpower  him .\nInstead   Baker  believed in Perez. And  since this is baseball  Perez won the battle but lost the game. Perez jammed Rizzo  forcing that weak  sickly blooper into left field. That  anyway  is how it was described by  several Nats  including Baker . To the Cubs  it was a perfectly placed clutch hit.\nFor the record  as they say  with perfect hindsight  I think that  the Nats  may have managed as if the playoffs were different from the regular season \u2014 which is a current vogue. If this game had been played in August  I suspect there would have been little complexity.\nAnd better options might have been chosen \u2014 ones that did not end up with  the Nats  losing a huge game in which neither of their two best relievers  Madson or Sean Doolittle  ever appeared.\nCould that all have worked out so simply? Kintzler in the seventh  Madson in the eighth and Doolittle in the ninth to put the Nats one win from the National League Championship Series?

Sure  the happy-go-lucky world of Nintendo might not scream \"gritty monochromatic detective drama.\" But you're clearly just not paying attention (or exploring Photo Mode in Super Mario Odyssey.)\nTheir proposed script begins with a panning shot over pictures of a smiling Luigi  as  Mario  grieves over the death of his brother and the better half of their Super Mario Bros. P. I. firm.

Bowser  a local land baron in the tradition of Chinatown  is up to his no-good tricks and is trying to marry her and take all her inheritance money.\nIf anyone is wondering  I've got this frame of Mario Odyssey paused  and am currently narrating \"Mario  P.I.\" as a film noir series while I have jazz music playing in the background.\nIn honor of his dead brother   Mario  goes on a wild-goose chase to rescue  his  dame.\nSome key scenes include: 1)  Mario  meeting up with Bowser at a country club  with Bowser intimidating the detective by totally owning his opponent in Wii Tennis while  Mario  tries to question him  2) A second femme fatale  in the form of Birdo  who cannot speak English but gives  Mario  an egg with a key piece of evidence before she's murdered  3) One (if not several) car chase scenes  in which the cars are replaced with  Mario  go-karts and the tommy guns replaced with Blue Shells.\nBut  like any good noir film  the journey ends in deception. As  Mario  gets deeper into the investigation  eventually managing to kill Bowser  he learns a sickening truth. The Koopa King and Drug Lord Bowser was actually just small pennies compared to the real boss in charge: Princess Peach  who runs the drug operation at the heart of the Mushroom Kingdom. She needed a fall guy.  Mario  was her guy.

For all the hand-wringing about whether  he  was living up to the contract   Sumlin \u00e2\u0080\u0099s buyout ended up at $10.5 million  behind what Arkansas had to pay Bret Bielema (could be as much as $15.4 million)  what UCLA had to pay Jim Mora ($12 million) and what Arizona State had to pay Todd Graham ($12 million).\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to think about as  Sumlin  settles into  his  promising new job at Arizona because  in many ways  you wonder in this coaching environment whether  he  might yet again be a step ahead of the game.\nUnless you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re competing for national championships \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and realistically  there are only about seven schools right now who are doing that \u00e2\u0080\u0094  Sumlin \u00e2\u0080\u0099s quality of life at Arizona is going to be better than 99% of  his  peers  even though now  he \u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be more like the 50th highest-paid coach in the country rather than in the top 10.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was the right time and right place for me \u00e2\u0080\u009d  Sumlin  said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a good fit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nTexas A&M coach Kevin Sumlin and receiver Camron Buckley.

For conservative midtown Manhattan  this is an event. For  Ricky Martin   it's just another day at the office. This morning  it's the Today show  where  Martin  is appearing on Today's live summer-concert series with a performance that ties up traffic for hours.\n\"Ever since I've known  him  \" says Robi Rosa  the co-author of  Martin 's smash single \"Livin' la Vida Loca\" and a former member of Menudo who roomed with  Martin  when  Martin  joined the Latin boy band  \"Ricky has exuded a sense of joy.\"\nNot to mention organization.

After leaving the band at seventeen  Martin considered quitting show business. But a role in a Mexico City musical led to soap opera work there  and then to a part on General Hospital and a stint on Broadway in Les Mis\u00e9rables in 1996. In 1991   he  began releasing a string of four solo albums  which sold a total of 15 million copies worldwide.\n He  did not work alone. \"When  Ricky  called me  about 1993  saying  he  wanted to do a Latin album  I was surprised \" says Rosa  whom  Martin  calls  his  \"Latin soul\" \u2014 a bit of a dark one  at that. \" Ricky  and I are as much alike as Julio Iglesias and Sid Vicious \" Rosa says with a laugh. A little Sid Vicious is clearly what  Martin  knew  he  needed; it was a song Rosa co-wrote  \"Maria \" that broke  Martin  in Spain and the rest of Europe.\nBut it wasn't until February that America heard the beat itself.  Martin 's hip-popping rendition of \"The Cup of Life\" at the Grammys brought even that jaded audience to its Manolo Blahnik-shod feet.

So my mother gave everything up and came back to Puerto Rico.\nThat I was someone who was good at hiding feelings \u2014 really good. I was an expert. I was like  \"No  I don't want to feel this \" and I wouldn't. It was hard for me to say  \"I love you.\" I wouldn't dare. I was afraid of rejection.

That is because North Korea already holds US allies hostage to violence we cannot control\u00e2\u0080\u0094and may already or will soon pose a similar threat to the US homeland\u00e2\u0080\u0094and thus presents an unacceptable risk of retaliation for any American offensive military action. There is nothing the US can do for North Korea that might induce it to denuclearize  because keeping North Korea on a war footing vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis the US keeps  the regime of Kim Jong Un  in power. There is nothing the international community  including China  can do to North Korea by enforcing sanctions  or for North Korea by relieving it of sanctions  that would convince North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons because  the regime  is convinced  with some reason  that it is only the threats it poses to others that keep it from suffering regime change. Nevertheless  the US cannot tolerate or co-exist with a North Korean nuclear capability; that is because such a capability would deter the US from protecting its allies were they threatened  extorted or attacked by North Korea. This result would risk dissolution of the American-Pacific alliance and the rapid proliferation of nuclear weapons to former allies that had become intensely nationalistic and anti-American. There is however one option that has yet to be considered and that has some promise.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true that North Korea used to seek financial assistance in exchange for promises to restrain its weapons programs.  Kim  has changed all that. This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t because of  his  ferocious and aggressive personality so much as it arises from the evolution of the North Korean regime and its political role in the world.\nThat role has developed in an ominous new direction since 1989. When Russian subsidies to North Korea disappeared in 1990  the resulting famine killed up to 10% of the North Korean population  but North Korea neither collapsed nor moderated its policies. In fact  we can now see that the development of a nuclear weapons program was a crucial part of  the regime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s  domestic survival strategy after 1989 precisely because this program provokes US hostility and concern.\nDuring the Cold War  North Korea and South Korea had comparable economic development  and South Korea had a series of highly authoritarian if not totalitarian governments. With the end of the Cold War  South Korea enjoyed a booming economy and a very promising democracy. Internationally  communist governments were collapsing everywhere. But the response of Kim Jung Il was to increase its reliance on military force and put the nation on a war footing for an imminent US invasion. Consumer shortages  famine  rationing were all justified in order to maintain an immense military\u00e2\u0080\u0094its active duty army is the fourth largest in the world. The external threat also justified political oppression to identify and destroy traitors. B. R. Myers  a North Korea scholar at Dongseo University in South Korea  has suggested that the famine \u00e2\u0080\u009cmay have strengthened support for  the regime  by [animating a] sense of ethnic victimhood.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Myers concluded in a 2010 book  \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is  the regime \u00e2\u0080\u0099s awareness of a pending legitimacy crisis  not a fear of attack from without  which makes it behave evermore provocatively on the world stage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Thus US reactions tend to consolidate power in North Korea; and there is nothing we can do to ease the threat to North Korean legitimacy in the long run because the threat to  the regime  derives from global trends that are weakening the domestic hold on power of all industrial nation-state regimes (though  as we shall see  there are steps that can ease  Kim \u00e2\u0080\u0099s domestic anxieties in the near term.)\nMoreover  North Korean weakness\u00e2\u0080\u0094as to which their aggressive foreign policy is a compensation\u00e2\u0080\u0094also tends to limit US options. I suppose it might be said  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t got nothing  you got nothing to lose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But it is true with respect to all states that while sanctions can force small foreign policy changes  they cannot effectuate changes that fundamentally threaten the stability and continuity of the government. North Korea sees its weapons as essential to its survival\u00e2\u0080\u0094not only by keeping its enemies at bay (this is the lesson of Saddam Hussein  Mouammar Khadafy and the Ukraine)\u00e2\u0080\u0094but nuclear weapons are also essential to the internal stature of  the regime . It is a feature that is not often appreciated of sanctions that they work  or can work  quite successfully  only within a rather narrow sphere because that is their utility. People who say  \u00e2\u0080\u009cSanctions don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work \u00e2\u0080\u009d don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t appreciate that if sanctions could result in the kind of policy changes that are wrought from military action  a military response would ensue. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s their very limitation that makes sanctions useful.\nThis suggests that the Chinese  who cannot be indifferent to the proliferation of nuclear weapons to South Korea and Japan  ought to be willing to pressure North Korea into denuclearization. And indeed  pressuring the Chinese to pressure the North Koreans is the substance of current US policy. There are risks in pursuing this policy; China would probably insist on the withdrawal of the THAAD systems from South Korea because they not only protect South Korea from North Korea but also degrade the effectiveness of the Chinese deterrent (even if only marginally). But more important than this is the fact that China really has very little leverage over North Korea. Indeed it should be noted that  Kim  has steadily weakened Chinese influence by purging pro-Chinese North Korean officials. Moreover  there is no negative pressure\u00e2\u0080\u0094cutting off fuel supplies or reducing an already modest trading relationship\u00e2\u0080\u0094that could force  the North Korean regime  to change course because  as has been remarked  one does not commit suicide for fear of death. Thus I have concluded that there is nothing the US or China can do to North Korea\u00e2\u0080\u0094no coercive acts at an acceptable cost to the US\u00e2\u0080\u0093that will yield the denuclearization of the North Korean arsenal.\nBut that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that there is no conceivable way out of this crisis. On the contrary  one can already see the outlines of a possible negotiation. What follows is a rather radical proposal that has many counterintuitive aspects but which  I have come to believe  represents the best way out of a rapidly deteriorating position. This option would be to induce a nuclear guarantee for  the North Korean regime from China \u00e2\u0080\u0094an instance of Chinese extended deterrence.\nJang Song Thaek  Kim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s uncle  was North Korea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s principal interlocutor with China. His arrest and execution\u00e2\u0080\u0094as well as the removal of dozens of other officials associated with closer ties to China\u00e2\u0080\u0094marked a turning point in Kim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rejection of a foreign policy that attempted to promote economic growth in favor of a \u00e2\u0080\u009cmilitary first\u00e2\u0080\u009d policy. His truculent indifference to Chinese sensibilities was confirmed when he ordered the assassination in February of his brother  Kim Jong Nam  who had been living in Macao under Chinese protection. Then earlier this month  Kim Jong Un pointedly chose the week of Xi Jinping\u00e2\u0080\u0099s BRICS summit in Beijing to detonate a nuclear test. So one mustn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t oversell the chance of success for this proposal.\nBut if the policy I propose is the least bad for the US to pursue\u00e2\u0080\u0094if it is imperative that we at least try this new option before resorting to war or accepting defeat\u00e2\u0080\u0094is it not also the least bad option for North Korea in light of the certain decline of its long-term security in the face of advancing US first-strike technology? Remember that it was  Kim \u00e2\u0080\u0099s awareness of a crisis in legitimacy that drove  him  to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cmilitary-first\u00e2\u0080\u009d policy. The integration of China into the international system  rather than the collapse of the Soviet satellite regimes  could show a new path toward the domestic legitimation of  Kim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s regime . Our aim must be to re-orient  Kim \u00e2\u0080\u0099s paranoia  making  him  more afraid of losing an attractive opportunity for security in the eyes of  his  own people than  he  is afraid of dependence on China.\nNo one will take this radical proposal seriously unless we stop deluding ourselves about the incentives we can realistically employ to compel  the North Korean regime . There is no chance that anything short of an ironclad guarantee of their preservation as a dynastic regime free from outside intervention will modify their behavior. They will starve their people and run almost incalculable risks because they have no other credible choice. And no guarantee that the US gives is credible to the North Korean leadership.\nThis observation leads one to draw a couple of further conclusions that are sometimes absent in the public debate. The first is that as our alliances are what are actually threatened  we should move swiftly to shore these up. Consultations with our allies in Tokyo  Canberra and Seoul are paramount. What do they want to see from us? How can we avoid embarrassing them in front of their own publics without hamstringing the protection of our legitimate security interests? Second  we should not make threats that validate Kim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rhetoric by making it appear that we are planning to punish him for his rhetoric. That there is a plot by the Americans to destroy  his regime  is the fundamental premise of his domestic propaganda as well as his thinking.\nIn summary  economic sanctions  and/or threats of our military action can push  Kim  towards negotiations but in the end those negotiations will be highly likely to founder on  his  need for nuclear guarantees. We need to prepare for the fact that a resolution of the current crisis will likely require a PRC guarantee. Are we prepared to support that? I think we should be. The course I propose is not without costs: it might increase the risk of a Chinese-US confrontation  and it would link Chinese nuclear strategy to a surrogate state that is inclined to get into conflicts. It is  however  a more promising option than any being canvassed at the present.

Kim  had one installed in my bedroom and our friend Robin Anton  who is the founder of The Pussycat Dolls  was just messing around  and Kylie hops up there  twirls around a couple times  and it became this thing.\n Kim  When we would travel  I remember people calling mine  Kourtney  and Khloe's names and we thought they knew us from high school or something. We just didn't get it. Then they started chasing us down at the airport. That was the first time that we were like  \"Oh my God.\"\nKhloe In Armenia  I've never seen so many people. I got separated from  Kim  and everyone  and they all got in the van and left. I was like  \"Hello? I'm still in the fucking crowd of people!\" Everyone forgot about me and Erin Paxton  our audio mixer  took her boom and literally fished me back into our producer's van.\nKris There was barely Twitter when we started. Ryan called  Kim  and said  \"There's this thing called Twitter you might want to pay attention to.\" The girls [began] embracing their audience and sharing their lives.\n Dow Kim  sort of paved the way for the economic structure of native influencer marketing. Before the rise of the common man YouTuber in their bedroom  you had people like  her .  She  was the one who kicked down the door and got the brands to spend money in that area because  she  showed success. Brands noticed that when when you would pay a celebrity to send out a branded tweet  they were getting more click-throughs for the dollar  so it made more monetary sense. That's why that revolution started.\nDow When  Kim  did the cover of CR [in 2013]  that's when  she  was anointed. It's Carine Roitfeld's magazine  Karl Lagerfeld shot it and Riccardo Tisci art-directed. Fashion washes away all sins. That's when  she  went next-level.\nIn August 2011   Kim  married NBA player Kris Humphries. The E! special of the $6 million wedding earned the network its highest ratings to date and more than $10 million in ad revenue.\n Kim  There was all this attention on the wedding  and I thought maybe it was just the pressure of the show giving me this anxiety. My friends told me I just had cold feet  but even the producers said  \"You don't seem happy. You don't have to go through with this.\" The night before  my mom pulled me aside  off camera  and was like  \"This isn't it for you. Why don't you go away and I'll handle it?\" I felt like    if I pulled out now  everyone's going to think I just did  it  for the show. Then afterwards  people were saying  \"You have to stay married for a year \" but I physically couldn't do  it . When I made the decision [to divorce]  everyone said it was made up for the show. Everyone really wanted to take me down.", "output": "The Kardashian Decade: How a Sex Tape Led to a Billion", "category": "Title Generation 1046.json"}, {"instruction": "Given a document, generate a short title of the document.
